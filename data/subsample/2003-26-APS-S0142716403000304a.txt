ABSTRACT
The current study examined the effect of story presentation rates on story recall performance in 35
individuals with Down syndrome and 3 control groups (35 mental age matched, 35 syntax comprehension matched, and 35 syntax production matched children). Three short audiotaped stories were
presented to each individual at three different rates (normal, storyteller [slow with expressive inflections], and slow rate). The effect of group but not rate was significant. Individuals with Down
syndrome recalled more content words than the production-matched group and the productionmatched group recalled fewer content words than the mental age matched and comprehensionmatched groups. The results were interpreted in relation to working memory deficits in individuals
with Down syndrome, developmental change in story recall of typically developing children, and
the contribution of syntax comprehension to story recall.

Language production involves multiple levels of processing, including message
formation, compilation of the linguistic components (phonetic phonological,
syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic elements), and speech execution (Bock,
1982, 1996; Griffin & Bock, 1998). Although these processes occur relatively
automatically in typically developing children, trade-off effects can be observed
when the speaking task is effortful (Streim & Chapman, 1987). Individuals with
Down syndrome (DS) experience deficits in morphosyntactic production in
spontaneous narrative and conversational samples (Chapman, 1997; Vicari, Caselli, & Tonucci, 2000). Because individuals with DS may experience greater
effort in morphosyntactic processes than individuals at the same or higher expressive language levels, tasks that reduce information processing load compared to spontaneous narrative might benefit them more than controls matched

on spontaneous narrative production. Story recall is such a task, because it provides propositional content, as well as models, of the lexical choices and syntactic structures to convey the narrative, compared to the production task of spontaneously organizing a narrative on a topic. Reduced processing demands (compared
to spontaneous narration) might increase recall of lexical items and propositional
content more for the group with DS, making them more closely resemble a group
matched for mental age (MA). In this study we evaluate whether the reduced
processing demands of story recall (instead of generating spontaneous narrative)
selectively affect individuals with DS for auditory story presentation at a normal
rate, and we investigate the possible additional ameliorating effects of slower
speaking rates, with or without the engaging prosodic variation used by skilled
storytellers. As individuals with DS have auditory short-term memory deficits
(Kay-Raining Bird & Chapman, 1994; Seung & Chapman, 2000), they might
benefit more from having stories presented at slower rates. In the following
sections, we will review evidence for the behavioral phenotype in DS, the reduced demands of the story recall task compared to spontaneous narrative for a
variety of populations, and the ameliorating effects of slower speaking rate.
EVIDENCE FOR A BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE IN DS

Children and adolescents with DS show a typical phenotype of deficits in expressive language and verbal short-term memory. The short-term memory span
of individuals with DS is typically lower than their nonverbal cognitive level
(Seung & Chapman, 2000; Marcell & Weeks, 1988). Their language production
level is lower than that of their comprehension and nonverbal cognitive skills
(Chapman, 1995, 1997; Chapman & Hesketh, 2000; Dykens & Hodapp, 2001;
Marcell & Weeks, 1988). Individuals with DS speak in shorter utterances on
average than their nonverbal cognitive levels or syntax comprehension levels
would predict in spontaneous language production (conversation samples or narrative samples). The short-term memory span of individuals with DS is typically
lower than their nonverbal cognitive level (Marcell & Weeks, 1988; Seung &
Chapman, 2000). Chapman and associates (Boudreau & Chapman, 2000;
Miles & Chapman, 2002) examined narratives generated by individuals with
DS. Story content and length of narrative (Boudreau & Chapman, 2000) and
thematic content (Miles & Chapman, 2002) of narratives based on wordless
films and picture books were significantly better than typically developing children matched for syntax production and similar to those of groups matched
for syntactic comprehension and nonverbal cognitive levels. The problems of
individuals with DS in the content and organization of discourse, however, were
not as great as problems in the computational aspects of language skill (morphosyntax) in narrative.
EVIDENCE FOR THE REDUCED PROCESSING DEMANDS OF STORY
RECALL COMPARED TO SPONTANEOUS NARRATIVE

Story recall or retell is a commonly used clinical and research tool that has
advantages over other tools. First, story retelling is less demanding for partici-

pating children than generating spontaneous narrative (Liles & Duffy, 1995;
Merritt & Liles, 1987, 1989; Purcell & Liles, 1992; Sutter & Johnson, 1995).
Immediate story recall would likely reduce the effort required to generate a
spontaneous story for children with DS who typically show language production
deficits. Second, it provides us with richer information than a sentence as a unit
of production (Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, 1991; Tager-Flusberg, 1995) while
controlling story context across participants (Ripich & Griffith, 1988). Paul and
Smith (1993) utilized a structured story retell task (i.e., Bus Story; Renfrew,
1977) with 4-year-old children. They studied narrative production of children
who were identified as late talkers (slow in expressive language development)
when they were 2 years old and a control group of typically developing children.
When the story retell of the children was evaluated at age 4, children who
remained as late talkers at age 4 scored lower in narrative measures compared
to the normal control group and to late-talking children who made progress
toward the normal group.
Story recall has been studied in various populations including children with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (Lorch et al., 1999), children with learning disabilities (Copmann & Griffith, 1994; Griffith, Ripich, & Dastoli, 1986;
Ripich & Griffith, 1988), children with mental retardation including DS
(Bacon & Rubin, 1983; Loveland, McEvoy, Tunali, & Kelley, 1990; Luftig &
Greenson, 1983; Tager-Flusberg, 1995), and children with language impairment
(Graybeal, 1981; Merritt & Liles, 1987, 1989; Paul & Smith, 1993; Purcell &
Liles, 1992).
Loveland et al. (1990) compared storytelling characteristics of children with
DS and autism who were matched for age and verbal-mental level. The authors
reported that both groups generated primitive narratives with different profiles
that were related to the syndrome specific phenotypes: children with DS demonstrated more communicative gestures compared to the children with autism, and
children with autism produced more "bizarre" responses that were interpreted as
a syndrome-related deficit in pragmatics. Crais and Chapman (1987) examined
children with language learning disabilities (LLDs) and reported that the LLD
group performed poorly in story recall and in answering questions that require
making inferences, compared to a receptive vocabulary matched control group.
Wolman, van den Broek, and Lorch (1997) examined story recall and reported
that children with mild mental retardation recalled less of the story content compared to the children with learning disabilities. Wilson and Ivani-Chalian (1995)
found that the story recall subtest on the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test
was the most difficult of the subtests for the individuals with DS. These studies
examined characteristics of stories in terms of quantity and quality of story
recall, evaluating recall of story grammar elements (Stein & Glen, 1979), number of total utterances recalled, or complexity of story recall.
Several variables have been identified to affect story recall in typically developing children. Those include story schema, existence of causality within the
story, constructive memory related to a child's prior knowledge (Greenhoot,
2000), and language comprehension. The majority of that research has been
done in typically developing children and has focused on the effect of schema
on story recall (Davidson & Hoe, 1993; Hudson & Nelson, 1983). Nezworski,

Applied Psycholinguistics 24:4
Seung & Chapman: Story presentation rate and Down syndrome

606

Stein, and Trabasso (1982) found that story schema plays a significant role in
retrieving stories. Also having causal connections within the story assisted children in recalling the content words more accurately (van den Broek, Lorch, &
Thurlow, 1996).
EFFECTS OF SPEAKING RATE ON COMPREHENSION
AND PRODUCTION

Comprehension of syntax is affected by speaking rate for sentences in typically
developing children, with poorer comprehension by kindergarten and secondgrade children at faster rates (4.7-6.3 syllables/s) than slow rates (2.6-3.4 syllables/s; Berry & Erickson, 1973). Individuals with specific language impairment
and auditory short-term memory deficits show increased difficulty in fast-mapping novel words in production but not comprehension when presentation rates
are fast, rather than slow (Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996).
Processing factors affecting verbal short-term memory or story comprehension might differentially affect the task for individuals with DS. To the extent
that long-term knowledge, rather than verbal short-term memory, plays a role
in story recall (Cain, Oakhill, Barnes, & Bryant, 2001), recall performance of
individuals with DS might resemble cognitively matched or syntax comprehension matched comparison groups, rather than a group matched for syntax production. To the extent that auditory short-term memory factors determine story
recall, individuals with DS might more closely resemble the syntax production
group.
Here we varied story presentation rates to examine the effect of additional
time or prosodic information to process and recall the story in individuals with
DS. The rates included a normal speaking rate condition and two slow conditions (one with the heightened prosodic variation characteristic of engaging storytellers; Sutter & Johnson, 1995). In the present study, we presented audiotaped
stories that varied in presentation speed (normal rate, storyteller rate, and slow
rate) to each participant. Manipulation of the story presentation rates was selected to evaluate the reduced language-production performance of individuals
with DS at a relatively larger unit (i.e., a short story) compared to a string of
numbers (Seung & Chapman, 2000) or single-sentence level tasks (Seung &
Chapman, 2003).
The purpose of this study was to compare group performances for spoken
recall of recorded stories at three presentation rates, as indicated by number of
words recalled. We asked four questions: Do individuals with DS have better
story recall than typically developing children matched on spontaneous narrative
production, but not compared to those who were matched on nonverbal MA or
syntax comprehension? Would individuals with DS benefit from having extra
processing time or information (either slow rate of story presentation or slow
rate and extra prosodic information of storyteller rate)? Does syntax comprehension contribute to story recall in DS and control groups? Is there a developmental difference in story recall performance in the typically developing control
groups?

METHOD
Participants

The participants with DS were part of a longitudinal study in which we tested
the same individuals four times at approximately 2-year intervals. The story
recall task was carried out at Time 3. We recruited participants (initially aged
5-20 years, in approximately equal distribution across the age span) with DS
from the state of Wisconsin and northern Illinois through the human subject
core at the Waisman Center in Madison, Wisconsin, and through newsletters for
parent groups. Typically developing children were recruited at ages 2 through 6
(the range of mental ages and syntax comprehension and production levels)
through the database of local births at the human subjects core, fliers at local
stores, and bulletin boards in small towns outside Madison.
Participants included 35 individuals with trisomy 21 DS and three statistically
matched control groups (n = 35 in each control group). The three control groups
consisted of a nonverbal MA-matched group (MA group) who were matched
on a mean age equivalent score of the Pattern analysis and Bead memory subtests of the Stanford-Binet test (Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986), a syntax
comprehension matched group (comprehension group) who were matched on
the age equivalent score of the Test for Auditory Comprehension of Language--
Revised (TACL-R; Carrow-Woolfolk, 1985) total score, and a syntax production matched group (production group) who were matched on mean length of
utterance (MLU) of a 12-min narrative sample. Each participant's hearing and
middle ear function were screened by a certified audiologist. Hearing thresholds
were obtained at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz at 20 and 40 dB in the sound field,
and individuals with a hearing loss greater than 45 dB (i.e., mild hearing loss)
were excluded from the study. Also excluded from the study were individuals
who relied primarily on signing to communicate. Children in the comparison
groups were excluded if their cognitive or language assessment scores fell more
than 2 SDs below the average for their age. We elected the broader definition
of normal range because we wanted to be sure the DS phenotype differences
among skills were outside the normal range; but for those concerned that the
criterion might have led to the inclusion of children with language impairment,
defined according to a 1.5-SD criterion, an inspection of scores reveals that only
2 children's Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test--Revised (Dunn & Dunn, 1981)
scores fell between -1.5 and -2 SD (standard scores were 76 when M = 100,
SD = 15). All of the TACL-R scores fell above -1.5 SD of the mean.
The participants' characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The difference
between the DS and matched control group did not reach statistical significance,
t (67) = 0.5 for nonverbal MA between the DS and MA-control group, t (67) =
0.2 for TACL total score between the DS and comprehension matched control
group, and t (68) = 0.4 for MLU between the DS and production-matched control group. The mother's years of education was an index of socioeconomic
status; there were no group differences in mother's education, F (1, 3) = 1.7,
p > .05. There were significant group differences in pure tone average thresh-

within acceptable limits for understanding speech. The gender of the participants
was not a primary research question, but we tried to have a balanced number of
boys and girls. There were 18 males and 17 females in the DS group, 20 males
and 15 females in the MA group, 21 males and 14 females in the comprehension
group, and 20 males and 15 females in the production group.
Procedures

Research assistants in communicative disorders at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison administered the research protocols. Each participant listened to a total
of three different audiotaped stories varying in rate (normal, storyteller [slow
rate with inflection], and slow). Stories were simplified and adapted from Crais
and Chapman (1987) and taped at 3.0-3.2 words/s for the normal rate, 1.4-1.5
words/s for the storyteller, and 1.4-1.5 words/s for the slow rate. The storyteller
condition was also slow and included more varied prosody than the slow rate
condition (Sutter & Johnson, 1995). This condition was included to compare the
effects of more engaging prosody at the same slow rate. The participants listened

Applied Psycholinguistics 24:4

609

to one story at a time after the following instructions: "You are going to listen
to a story. Then you're going to tell the story back to me. Listen very carefully."
Immediately after listening to the story, the examiner asked the participant to
tell the story back to her. An examiner prompted participants at the end of the
story retelling task by saying "Is that all?" "Is there anything else?" or "Anything else about the story?" Listener effects on story performance arise when
the speaker knows that the listener already knows the story (Menig-Peterson,
1976; Peterson, 1990; Sonnenschein, 1988) and when there is no other reason
to be recounting the story (e.g., rehearsal). In this study, although the listener
was the same across the three stories, the stories were different and their order
of presentation and recall were counterbalanced across listeners.
Each participant's story recall performance was audio- and videotaped. Individuals' story recalls were transcribed by graduate assistants using the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT; Miller & Chapman, 1990). The
following is one of the stories used in the study. The other stories are provided
in Appendix A.
Once there was a lion. In the morning he woke up hungry. He went to the river
to look for something to eat. There was a monkey looking for bananas. The lion
asked the monkey "Can I come down to drink?" The monkey laughed and said
"Oh, yes, lion." And just as the lion got near, the monkey swung up into the tree.
The lion went home hungry that day.
Transcription

Audiotaped samples were transcribed using SALT (Miller & Chapman, 1990)
on a Vax mainframe computer. Graduate assistants transcribed samples orthographically following SALT conventions. Transcribers listened to the sample
three times, and if one could not understand the segment, it was designated
unintelligible. Utterance boundaries were determined by intonation pattern (i.e.,
rising or falling) or a pause longer than 2 s. Conjoined main clauses were segmented after the second clause, to limit the effect of discourse linking with
"and." Transcription reliability was checked for all transcripts by a second transcriber and disagreements noted as additions, omissions, or changes to morphemes or changes to segmentation. Disagreements were resolved for the final
transcription. The mean number of summed disagreements (additions plus omissions plus changes) per story per participant in morpheme transcription was 1.2
for the DS group and 1.78 for the control group. The mean number of disagreements in utterance segmentation were .3 per story for the DS group and .05 per
story for the control group.
Scoring

We ran SALT 1 analyses upon completion of transcription and generated a word
list for each story that included the words in the story with frequencies of their
occurrence. A research assistant compared the SALT 1 word lists for the stories
with the SALT 1 word lists for individual story retells and scored the frequencies of occurrence of content words by referring to the story gist word list.

Credit was given to each occurrence in the story. For example, monkey occurred
four times in Story A. Therefore, if a participant produced monkey six times
during Story A recall, a maximum of 4 was scored as frequency of words recalled. A graduate student rescored 10% of the sample to check interrater reliability. Ninety percent agreement was obtained between the raters, and the differences were reviewed and changes in data entry were followed before executing
statistical analyses.
RESULTS

Whether the groups differed in story recall as a function of different story presentation rates were examined using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The
dependent measure was the number of content words recalled.
Number of content words recalled: Lexical-level performance

The number of words recalled at three different story rates in each group is
provided in Table 2. The effect of story presentation rate on story recall was
analyzed using a Conditions (normal, storyteller, slow rate) x Groups (DS, MA,
comprehension, production groups) ANOVA. Condition was a within-subject
factor (3) and group a between-subjects factor (4). The main effect of group
was significant, F (1, 3) = 4.23, p < .05, 2 = .09, power = .85. Neither the story
rate main effect nor the story rate by group interaction effect was significant.
Because the main effect of group was significant (see Figure 1), post hoc
tests were used to compare groups. We selected Dunnett's C test, which does
not require equal variances to control for Type I errors across the multiple pairwise comparisons. Significant differences (p < .05) were found between the DS
and production groups (M = 2.64, SE = .93), the MA and production groups
(M = 3.75, SE = 1.2), and the comprehension and production groups (M = 2.94,
SE = 1.0).
The results supported the hypothesis that recall would improve with children's development. The language production matched group (youngest group)
recalled fewer content words than the other typically developing matched

groups. The results also supported the hypothesis that content recall by the DS
group would be better than their production matched group. However, the results did not support the hypothesis that different groups would recall content
words differently in different story conditions. Recall did not differ significantly
in the normal versus slow conditions or in the storyteller condition. There was
not a significant interaction effect between groups by conditions. Our stories
did not contrast the full range of the rate variable. None were presented at fast
rates, but the slow rate failed to show a predicted advantage for the DS group
and the production group. The results of the post hoc analyses support the hypothesis that story recall by individuals with DS was commensurate with the
comparison groups matched for nonverbal MA and syntax comprehension level
and was better than the typically developing group matched for syntax production. The results support the expected developmental difference of the youngest
group (syntax production group) in recalling fewer content words than the other
control groups. Thus, the control group comparisons confirm a divergence for
the group with DS between their expressive syntax production as indexed by
MLU from spontaneous narrative (the matching variable) and the lexical content
of their story retells.
Predictors of story recall within groups

Multiple regression analyses were conducted separately within the groups of
participants with DS and the typically developing children as a whole to predict
the individual variation in story recall in words. Two models were examined.
In Model 1, the predictors evaluated were syntax comprehension (TACL), nonverbal MA, and syntax production (MLU). In Model 2, chronological age (CA)
was added to the predictors of Model 1. In our previous study (Chapman, Seung,

Schwartz, & Kay-Raining Bird, 2000), we reported a significant contribution
of syntax comprehension to the production measures (MLU, intelligibility, and
total utterances) in a spontaneous narrative sample. We anticipated that syntax
comprehension would be the strongest predictor of words recalled and MA,
MLU, and CA did not contribute a significant explained variance when entered
after comprehension in the model.
The results of the multiple regression analysis are summarized in Table 3.
Within the DS group, the predictors accounted for 65% of the variance (adjusted
R 2 = .61) in words recalled, F (3, 31) = 18.77, p < .01. The standardized coefficient (beta) for syntax comprehension was significant (t = 2.28, p < .05), but
the beta was not significant for either MA or MLU. When CA was added to the
predictors for words recalled in Model 2, 72% of the variance was accounted
for by the predictors (adjusted R 2 = .68). The beta for CA was significant for
words recalled (t = 2.85, p < .05), but the beta for syntax comprehension was
not significant. This was the result of the size of the standard error as presented
in Table 3.
Within the typically developing children (n = 105), predictors accounted for
45% of the variance (adjusted R 2 = .44) in words recalled, F (3, 101) = 27.93,
p < .01. The beta for syntax comprehension was significant (t = 3.16, p < .05).
Again, only the beta for syntax comprehension was significant (t = 3.47, p <
.05). When we added CA as an additional predictor, the change was minimal
(variance accounted for was 46%, adjusted R 2 = .43 for the words recalled).
The multiple regression results suggest that individuals with DS who have

613

better syntax comprehension performance are likely to recall stories better, and
their CA contributed substantially to the predictions of words recalled. However,
this result needs to be interpreted carefully. As shown in Table 3, the magnitude
of beta in TACL was larger than that of the CA, but the standard error of the
TACL was relatively larger than that of the CA. The results also suggest that
typically developing children who have better syntax comprehension are more
likely to have better recall of spoken stories. The syntax comprehension level
contributed more in the DS group than in the typically developing children.
DISCUSSION

Group differences were revealed in story-recall performance, although the contrast of normal and slow speaking rates did not affect content word recall. Individuals with DS, and the comparison groups matched for MA and syntax comprehension level recalled more content words than the syntax production control
group. Further, syntax comprehension skill contributed to the prediction of individual variation in both the DS and typically developing groups.
Working memory and story retelling: Theoretical framework

To retell a short story immediately after hearing it, we need to depend on several
factors, including auditory working memory that stores verbatim information
for a brief period (Baddeley, 1990); long-term episodic and semantic memory
(Tulving, 1972); and language comprehension that processes phonological, morphosyntactic, semantic, and pragmatic aspects of language (Fletcher & Clayton,
1994; Poulsen, Kintsch, Kintsch, & Premack, 1979). In the current study, the
DS and MA groups did not differ in nonverbal MA, receptive vocabulary, or
syntax comprehension, but differed in spontaneous syntax production. The findings of commensurate story recall in words with the MA group and comprehension group, coupled with the portion of variance accounted for by syntax comprehension, suggest that story recall was affected more by syntax comprehension
and long-term knowledge or overall cognitive level than by working memory,
which holds relatively unprocessed information in temporary buffer. When auditory verbal short-term memory must be depended upon, in contrast (Seung &
Chapman, 2000), the DS group did not show a longer digit span than the production group and did show a shorter digit span than the MA group. The disparity
of results in these two studies are considered an outcome of the differences in
processes involved; the digit span task depends on working memory more than
comprehension processes, and the story recall task depends more on comprehension processes and long-term knowledge.
Relation between syntax comprehension and story recall

Story recall is a self-organized outcome of story comprehension involving a
complex process that includes multiple levels of processing including syntax
comprehension and mental representation of the story (Norbury & Bishop,

Applied Psycholinguistics 24:4
Seung & Chapman: Story presentation rate and Down syndrome

614

2002). The results of the multiple regression analyses indicate a strong connection between syntax comprehension and story recall.
The role of world knowledge has been demonstrated in other studies as well.
Poulsen et al. (1979) studied the effect of comprehension on story recall of 4and 6-year-old children. They found that children reconstruct a scrambled story
based on story schema into a meaningful story and that they recalled stories
better in a normal condition compared to the scrambled condition. Increased
causal structure can also improve story recall. Lorch et al. (1999) interpreted
their results to mean there was a positive linear relationship between recall and
number of causal connections within a story.
Developmental change in story recall

The poorer story recall in the production group compared to the other typically
developing children (i.e., MA and comprehension groups) suggests developmental change with age. The children in the production group were the youngest
(mean age of 3.2 years) in our study. Developmental change associated with
age has been reported along a broad continuum. A child's narrative development
begins at around 3 years of age and progresses onward (Stein & Policastro,
1984). Around 5-6 years of age, a child's narrative includes focused event
sequences (McCabe & Rollins, 1994). Varnhagen, Morrison, and Everall (1994)
reported age-related developmental increases in story recall (amount of recall)
in a study comparing preschoolers and first graders. Bamberg and Damrad-Frye
(1991) reported developmental differences in the use of evaluative comments in
children's narratives that compared narratives of 5- and 9-year-old children with
those of college students. The differences between the DS and MA groups and
between the DS and comprehension groups on words recalled did not approach
statistical significance, although they differed significantly from the syntax production control group. These findings indicate that story recall performance is
more commensurate with their nonverbal cognition and language comprehension levels than their production levels.
Limitations of the current study
Overall poor performance on story recall. Story recall performance in number
of content words recalled was notably low in all four groups. There are several
factors that might have contributed to the story recall performance obtained in
the current study. Recall was measured through verbatim occurrence of content
words; gist-based measures might have shown more evidence of recall (and
conversely, measures depending on syntactic proficiency might have shown
less).
Lack of visual support for story interpretation and memory might also have
played a role. Listening to audiotaped stories might have required more effortful
attention than watching a videotaped story by the participants (Johnson, 1988).
The task might also have been more conducive to holding the children's attention if picture props were available to facilitate activation of a mental model

Applied Psycholinguistics 24:4

615

(Johnson-Laird, 1983; Newton, 1994) of the stories or if the story was presented
in pictures as well (Berman, 1995). Gibson, Glynn, Takahashi, and Britton
(1995) reported that stories accompanied by pictures improved performance in
both children with mild mental retardation (10-13 years old) and typically developing children (6-7 years old). Beck and Clarke-Stewart (1998) presented a
segment of a dramatic movie to 5-year-old children and asked a set of questions
that guided the children's attention to the important feelings and facts of the
movie and corrected misunderstanding of the children's comprehension. The
results yielded better recall and comprehension of the narratives when the participants were asked a set of questions that were relevant to the stories. Merrit,
Culatta, and Trostle (1998) also made several suggestions for improving narrative performance of children with language impairment.
Rate manipulations. Failure to observe any difference for the slow-rate condition may have resulted from the recording of the slow-rate condition not sounding natural to the participants, but the slow rate with more expressive prosody
(storyteller condition) did not improve performance. The study would have benefited from inclusion of a faster than normal rate as well.
Use of MLU to match production group. Eisenberg, Fersko, and Lundgren
(2001) have suggested that the MLU be regarded as a measure of utterance
length, instead of a measure of morphosyntax. The utility of MLU as a measure
of morphosyntax will decrease once a child's MLU is higher than 4 or a child
reaches the age of 45-54 months (Bernstein & Tiegerman-Farber, 1997) unless
utterance segmentation conventions are adopted, as here, that control for the use
of and as a means to increase utterance length. (We allowed only one pair of
clauses to be conjoined by and or and then before introducing a period.) When
such segmentation criteria are added and the sample is a narrative one, the MLU
measures typically show increases through 7-9 years of age (see Leadholm &
Miller, 1995). However, the MLU clearly fails to capture all forms of syntactic
progress, including the pragmatic knowledge of relatively older children who
can take the discourse context into account (e.g., use of ellipsis in responding
to questions by an adult conversation partner, single word yes/no response to
questions, imitation of adult utterance; Johnston, 2001).
Use of content words as a measure of recall. Verbatim recall of story sentences

occurred only rarely in the transcripts. This fact excludes both a potential measure and a potential concern regarding the use of verbal recall as a measure of
story recall: that performance was only imitative. Word recall measure was selected for analysis of story recall due to the relatively poor performance of the
study participants in amount recalled. When story recall performance was defined in terms of the number of propositions (Foss & Hakes, 1978), where a
proposition was defined as the smallest meaningful unit of a sentence (a gist),
the pattern of results was similar to the results reported here. Had propositional
recall been better, story recall measures could have been used that reveal higher
levels of story recall, such as story grammar elements (Applebee, 1978; Page &
Stewart, 1985; Stein & Glenn, 1979), story points (Wilensky, 1983), or t-unit

Applied Psycholinguistics 24:4
Seung & Chapman: Story presentation rate and Down syndrome

616

measures that reveal syntactic complexity (a main clause plus subordinate
clauses; Hunt, 1970). These higher level measures should be examined in the
studies where recall levels permit their use.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS

A follow-up of the current study could contrast story recall directly for spoken
presentation versus a method that can improve the recall of propositions across
the groups, including picture presentation and verbal scaffolding. Schneider
(1996) examined effects of story modality (picture vs. oral presentation) on story
recall with children with language impairments and found improved recall with
pictures. Beck and Clarke-Stewart (1998) reported that children retold the stories better when they discussed the movie afterward with an adult following a
"pedagogical protocol" (i.e., monitor children's comprehension of stories via
structured sets of questions relevant to the story). This paradigm should be examined as an intervention tool for children with DS, who may benefit from
story-based language intervention. In addition, other factors that may impinge
on story recall of individuals with DS require investigation. Increased causal
structure has been identified as making stories easier for children to remember
(Lorch et al., 1999; Wolman et al., 1997) and might be differentially effective
for children with DS compared to the syntax production controls.
APPENDIX
STORY B
Once there was a boy named John. He wanted to marry a king's daughter. The king said
that first John had to find out which of the king's ducks was a girl duck. The magician
whispered to John the girl duck always went into the water first. So John took the ducks
to the lake. He said that the first duck into the water was a girl. John was right and the
king's daughter married him.
STORY C
Once there was a little dog named Frank who belonged to a girl named Susan. Frank
wanted to play. He scratched on the door. Susan opened it. And Frank jumped into her
arms wagging his tail. Susan looked puzzled. "Do you want to play?" she asked. She
got the frisbee from the closet and walked with Frank to the park. There she threw the
frisbee as far as she could and each time Frank caught it in his mouth and brought it
back.
