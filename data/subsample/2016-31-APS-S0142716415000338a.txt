ABSTRACT
There is substantial debate in the literature surrounding the development of children's phonological
representations (PRs). Although infant studies have shown children's representations to contain fine
phonetic detail, a consensus is yet to be reached about how and when phonemic categories emerge.
This study used novel implicit PR measures with preschool children (n = 38, aged 3 years, 6 months
to 4 years, 6 months) to test predictions made by these competing accounts of PR development. The
measures were designed to probe PR segmentation at the phoneme (rather than the phone) level without
requiring an explicit awareness of phonemes. The results provide evidence in support of vocabulary
driven restructuring, with PR segmentation found to be related to vocabulary when controlling for age.

Phonological representations (PRs) store information about the sounds in words
that a person holds in his or her vocabulary. Although PRs appear within many
models of speech processing (e.g., Jusczyk, 1993; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Werker
& Curtin, 2005), there is still much to learn about how their structure might change
from infancy to adulthood (e.g., Walley, 1993; Walley, Metsala, & Garlock, 2003).
It is important for us to understand the development of PRs and the processes driving their maturation because PRs play a key role in both early speech development
and the later process of learning to read (Fowler, 1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998;
Swan & Goswami, 1997).

Within the current paper the term PRs is used to describe the way that children
store phonological word forms in memory. There is continuing debate within the
literature about whether or not children store word forms separately for use in
perception and production (e.g., Diehl, Lotto, & Holt, 2004; Hickok & Poeppel,
2007; Liberman & Mattingly, 1985; Mackensen & Fikkert, 2010). While speech
perception and speech production have traditionally been studied as separate
domains (Casserly & Pisoni, 2010), there are numerous sources of evidence that
suggest that the two processes are closely related (for a review, see Casserly &
Pisoni, 2010) and may draw upon common representational structures (Galantucci,
Fowler, & Turvey, 2006; Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, & Studdert-Kennedy,
1967; Liberman & Mattingly, 1985).
Evidence for close links between speech perception and production comes
from a range of empirical sources (Casserly & Pisoni, 2010; Galantucci et al.,
2006) including the phenomenon of phonetic convergence, where speakers adjust
their speech during conversation to minimize the difference between their own
productions and those of the other speaker (Pardo, 2006) and the "McGurk effect,"
which describes how people's perception of a heard sound can be overridden by
the mouth movements of the speaker (Massaro, 1987; McGurk & MacDonald,
1976). Although alternative explanations have been proposed that do not require
speech perception and speech production to share common representations (e.g.,
for alternative account of the McGurk effect, see Massaro, 1998), it has been
argued that phonological representations that mediate both processes provide the
most parsimonious explanation (Galantucci et al., 2006) for these effects.
In support of this view, neurobiological studies have discovered mirror neurons
in monkeys (Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Gallese, & Fogassi, 1996) and humans (Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Matelli, et al., 1996) that become activated both when an action is
performed and when an action is observed. This finding suggests an equivalence,
or at least a direct connection, between perception and production at the representational level (Casserly & Pisoni, 2010). Further supporting evidence comes from
a transcranial magnetic stimulation study that found that a person's motor plans
become activated when the person hears someone else speak (Fadiga, Craighero,
Buccino & Rizzolatti, 2002). In light of the growing body of evidence in favor of
unified representation across production and perception, we have assumed within
the current work that children store the sound structure of words within a common set of phonological representations, recruited for both speech perception and
production.
Another key term used within this paper is phonological awareness (PA), which
is used to describe children's ability to reflect upon or manipulate the sounds within
words (e.g., can children tell you that the word "cat" can be segmented into the
phonemes /k/-/ae/-/t/?). One of the key aims of this paper was to devise a battery of
PR measures that allow us to probe the development of children's underlying representations, independent of their explicit awareness of phonological structure (PA).
THEORIES OF PR DEVELOPMENT

Theories of PR development have historically fallen into one of two camps: the
accessibility view and the emergent view (for a review, see Walley et al., 2003).

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4

999

The accessibility view proposes that children's PRs are segmented from infancy
but that children are only able to access the phonemic segments explicitly once
children learn to read and/or develop sufficient metacognitive skills (Liberman,
Shankweiler, & Liberman, 1989; Morais, Bertelson, Cary, & Alegria, 1986). Evidence in support of the accessibility view comes from studies showing infants to be
sensitive to minimal contrasts in perceptual tasks from as early as 14 months (e.g.,
Bailey & Plunkett, 2002, Ballem & Plunkett, 2005, Swingley, 2009; Swingley &
Aslin, 2000, 2002) alongside studies with school children showing a sudden surge
in performance on phoneme awareness tasks around the time that children learn
to read (for a review, see Ziegler & Goswami, 2005). Taken together, these studies
have been interpreted as evidence that infants have adultlike representations from
the outset but that they only become conscious of their phonological structure
through mastery of the alphabetic principle (Liberman et al., 1989; Morais et al.,
1986).
In contrast, the emergent view proposes that infants' PRs are initially underspecified, becoming gradually restructured as children's vocabularies grow (Fowler,
1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993). The rationale behind this view is
that infants do not need to store much detail in their representations to be able to
discriminate between known words when their vocabularies are small, but as their
vocabularies expand, children's PRs need to become better specified to allow efficient representation of similar-sounding words. The refinement of children's PRs
is proposed to take place gradually, continuing (for some words) until as late as 7
years of age (Fowler, 1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Nittrouer, Studdert-Kennedy,
& McGowan, 1989).
One theory under the umbrella of the emergent view, the lexical restructuring
model (LRM), proposes that children's PRs are initially holistic, becoming gradually segmented at the onset-rime (e.g., cat  /k/-/aet/) and then the phoneme
level (cat  /k/-/ae/-/t/) as children's vocabularies grow. The LRM predicts that
high-frequency words from dense neighborhoods (those for which there are many
similar-sounding words already in the lexicon) will be restructured first, with
some less frequent words from sparse neighborhoods remaining underspecified
into adulthood. Within the LRM the degree of restructuring of PRs constrains
the child's explicit knowledge of the sound system, referred to as PA (Metsala
& Walley, 1998). The LRM proposes that segmented PRs are prerequisite for the
development of PA and predicts that PA will follow the developmental path of PR
restructuring, with a delay between the two (Metsala & Walley, 1998).
Another variant of the emergent view, psycholinguistic grain size theory (Ziegler
& Goswami, 2005), shares with the LRM the idea that vocabulary growth drives
restructuring, but differs in terms of the extent to which PRs can be restructured in
the absence of literacy. The LRM suggests that phonemic representations precede
phonemic awareness (Metsala & Walley, 1998), whereas grain size theory proposes
that PRs will only become phonemic once children have been taught about the
correspondence between phonemes and graphemes (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005).
Within this account, literacy precedes phonemic representation, with children's
PRs becoming stored in terms of individual sounds only after they have been
taught about phoneme-grapheme correspondences through the process of learning
to read.

Over the last decade, there has being growing support for an alternative theoretical framework that encompasses elements of both the accessibility and the
emergent accounts. Within processing rich information from multidimensional
interactive representations (PRIMIR), rich, detailed information from the speech
signal is stored from infancy but the degree to which infants can access different
levels of this information changes according to the child's developmental level
and the task at hand (Werker & Curtin, 2005). Phoneme-level representation is
proposed to emerge gradually within the phoneme plane as statistical regularities
are extracted from word-level exemplars. Fuzzy phonemelike categories start to
form during infancy but do not become adultlike until they are "sharpened up"
through literacy experience. The PRIMIR framework was born out of a need to
reconcile seemingly contradictory studies where infants of the same age appear
to have different levels of phonological specificity depending on which task was
used. For example, while 14-month-old infants appear to have access to fine levels
of phonetic detail on mispronunciation detection tasks (Swingley & Aslin, 2002),
they struggle to distinguish between similar-sounding words during word learning tasks (Werker, Fennell, Corcoran, & Stager, 2002). In contrast, 20-month-old
infants have been shown to use fine levels of phonetic detail successfully on both
tasks (Werker et al., 2002). Within PRIMIR this differential performance by task
is explained in terms of dynamic filters that modulate access to information across
three interactive planes (the general perceptual, word form, and phoneme planes).
The degree to which infants access different levels of the rich information stored
from the input is influenced by three filters: the infants' initial biases (e.g., sensitivity to their native language), developmental level, and the demands of the task
(Werker & Curtin, 2005).
PHONOLOGICAL REPRESENTATION, VOCABULARY GROWTH, AND
ROLE OF LITERACY

The theoretical accounts outlined above make different predictions with regard to
two key questions:
1. Are infants' phonological representations qualitatively different from adults'?

According to the accessibility position, infants' representations are adultlike from
the beginning (Liberman et al., 1989; Morais et al., 1986). Each of the other
three accounts discussed above (the LRM, psycholinguistic grain size theory, and
PRIMIR), however, suggests some kind of representational change over development. While the LRM proposes a gradual increase in segmentation of children's
PRs from large to smaller grain sizes (Metsala & Walley, 1998), psycholinguistic
grain size theory frames the restructuring process in terms of details being added
at all grain sizes as children learn more words (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005). Within
PRIMIR, although rich phonetic detail is present from the outset, the representation of phonemes is proposed to emerge gradually.
Numerous studies have set out to test these predictions empirically; however, a
consensus has yet to be reached. Evidence in support of a developmental shift in the
way phonological representations are stored comes from differential performance
on a range of speech perception tasks (for a review, see Metsala & Walley, 1998).

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Ainsworth et al.: Lexical restructuring in preliterate children

1001

For example, while adults tend to categorize pesudowords in terms of phonemic
similarity (Treiman & Breaux, 1982), children tend to categorize them in terms
of global similarity (how similar they sound overall). This finding has been interpreted as evidence of children's PRs being less segmented than adults', with
a whole-to-parts shift proposed to take place gradually over childhood (Metsala
& Walley, 1998). By contrast, several infants studies (as mentioned above) have
shown infants' representations to contain sufficient detail to allow them to detect
minimal contrasts, leading some researchers to conclude that infants' PRs are
similar in nature to adults'. However, others have argued that early sensitivity to
minimal contrasts does not require infants' representations to be stored in terms
of phonemes. Ziegler and Goswami (2005) point out that there is often confusion
within the literature with regard to whether infants are sensitive to phonemes or
phones. In other words, just because an infant can discriminate between ped-bed
this does not necessarily mean that they categorize the p in pick as the same
phoneme as the p in cup. There is, therefore, a need for measures that probe
children's representations at the phoneme rather than the phone level.
2. If phonological representations do change over development, to what extent is
representational change driven by vocabulary growth?

Within the two key variants of the emergent account discussed above (the LRM,
see Metsala & Walley, 1998; and psycholinguistic grain size theory, see Ziegler &
Goswami, 2005), vocabulary growth is predicted to drive an increase in phonological specificity. Within the LRM, this restructuring is framed in terms of PRs becoming both increasingly segmented and increasingly detailed. We would, therefore,
expect vocabulary growth to be related to both PR accuracy and PR segmentation.
Literacy is not afforded a specific role within the LRM: vocabulary growth is emphasized as the key driver of lexical restructuring, although Metsala and Walley
(1998) acknowledge that literacy experience may impact on PR development.
Psycholinguistic grain size theory frames restructuring slightly differently in
terms of detail being added to PRs at all grain sizes rather than in terms of a wholeto-parts transition. Within psycholinguistic grain size theory, words will only
become stored in terms of phonemes once children gain knowledge of phoneme-
grapheme correspondences when learning to read. Grain size theory, therefore,
predicts vocabulary size to be related to PR accuracy and literacy experience to be
related to PR segmentation.
Finally, PRIMIR predicts that both vocabulary growth and literacy will be related to the emergence of phonemic representation (Werker & Curtin, 2005). As
children learn more words, statistical regularities within the word form plane
will become more apparent allowing phonemelike categories to form within the
phoneme plane. Literacy is then proposed to complete the process, refining the
emerging phonemes into an adultlike form. PRIMIR therefore predicts both vocabulary growth and literacy experience to be drivers of PR segmentation. However, it
does not predict a direct relation between either vocabulary or literacy experience
and PR accuracy, given that children's representations are presumed to contain
detailed information from early infancy. Performance on PR accuracy measures
would, however, be expected to vary depending on the developmental ability of
the child and the demands of the particular task.

A number of infant studies have investigated the relationship between phonological representation and vocabulary size yielding mixed results. Although Werker
et al. (2002) found significant correlations between vocabulary size and word
learning within a sample of 14-month-old infants, no such correlation was found
when the same task was used with older infants aged 20 months. Swingley and
Aslin (2000) also found no correlation between vocabulary and sensitivity to
mispronunciations in word recognition with infants aged 18 to 23 months. As
mentioned above, these infant studies measure sensitivity to differences at the
phone rather than the phoneme level. Within both the LRM and PRIMIR it is at
the phoneme level (as well as at the onset-rime level in the case of the LRM) that
we would expect to find a correlation between vocabulary growth and phonological
representation. There is, therefore, a need for studies that look for the correlation
between vocabulary growth and phonemic representation predicted by the LRM
and PRIMIR.
To date, the majority of research has focused either on the very early stages of
development (infants aged 14-24 months or on the PRs of children aged 4 and
above; e.g., Claessen, Heath, Fletcher, Hogben, & Leitao, 2009; Foy & Mann,
2009). However, the intermediate preschool period that extends beyond infancy
but precedes the point where children are exposed to formal literacy instruction
is of particular theoretical interest. Within variants of the emergent account and
PRIMIR, representational change is predicted to be a protracted process (Metsala
& Walley, 1998; Werker & Curtin, 2005; Ziegler & Goswami, 2005), and so
we would expect to find correlations between vocabulary size and measures of
phonological specificity beyond infancy. In order to investigate the degree to which
lexical restructuring takes place before children learn explicitly about phoneme-
grapheme correspondences in school, and to thus separate the potential influences
of vocabulary growth and literacy, we need to test children before they acquire this
knowledge. While infant studies are limited in terms of the range of methodologies
that are suitable in terms of metacognitive demands, preschool samples provide
a potential "window" where children have not yet learned to read but are at an
age where they can access more abstract tasks. By constructing tasks appropriate
for preschool children that probe phonological representation at the phoneme
level, we can look for evidence of emerging phonemic representation (rather than
sensitivity to phones) before children begin formal literacy instruction. This is the
aim of the current study.
MEASUREMENT OF PHONOLOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS

The measurement of PRs is challenging for two reasons. First, many PR tasks require explicit phonological awareness that draws on metacognitive abilities rather
than purely on the representations themselves. When trying to measure underlying
PRs, we need to create tasks that do not require explicit PA, especially when we
are measuring the PRs of preschool children whose metacognitive abilities are not
fully developed. For this reason, tasks need to be as implicit as possible and should
not require children to explicitly reflect upon or manipulate phonemes. Second,
measurement of underlying representation necessarily involves behavioral tasks
that inevitably involve other elements of speech processing and that may impede

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Ainsworth et al.: Lexical restructuring in preliterate children

1003

interpretation of results. Measures of PRs that require a spoken response are potentially confounded by output difficulties (Claessen & Leitao, 2012; McNeill &
Hesketh, 2010). In other words, if a child fails to produce a word correctly, we do
not know if this is because the child has an inaccurate representation of the word,
inaccurate motor programs, problems with articulation, or all three. In order to
avoid the confound of speech output difficulties, it is necessary to use at least some
tasks that do not require a spoken response, for example, receptive PR judgment
tasks (Claessen & Leitao, 2012, McNeill & Hesketh, 2010).
Another way to circumvent this problem is to isolate a particular aspect of
speech processing through comparisons across different tasks. For example Vance,
Stackhouse, and Wells (2005) compared children's performance on naming, word
repetition, and nonword repetition using the same stimuli across different age
groups. Vance et al. found that while older children showed an advantage for
repeating words over nonwords, 3-year-olds performed equally well for word and
nonword repetition. Vance et al. (2005) suggest that this may be an indication that
young children process both words and nonwords using a "bottom up" approach,
relying increasingly on lexical information as they get older. The current study
attempts to replicate this intriguing result.
Tasks designed to measure children's underlying PRs fall broadly into two categories: measures of PR accuracy/accessibility and measures of PR segmentation.
Measures of PR accuracy and accessibility

The first category aims to measure how accurately children store the sounds in
words and how quickly they can retrieve them. The most commonly used tasks
within this category are naming, word repetition, articulation correction (Anthony
et al., 2010; Fowler & Swainson, 2004), in which the child is asked to correct a
puppet's mispronunciation, and mispronunciation detection. The mode of delivery
for mispronunciation detection varies according to age: whereas older children are
asked directly whether a stimulus is pronounced correctly (e.g., Anthony et al.,
2010; Claessen et al., 2009), mispronunciation detection in infants is inferred from
eye gaze (Bailey & Plunkett, 2002, 2005; Swingley, 2009; Swingley & Aslin, 2000,
2002).
Although there are numerous studies that have used measures of PR accuracy
with children, few have addressed the lexical restructuring hypothesis directly.
Studies of PR accuracy have instead tended to focus either on the dimensionality
of PR quality (e.g., Anthony et al., 2010, 2011) or on which tasks best differentiate
between clinical and typically developing populations (e.g., Alt & Suddarth, 2012;
Claessen & Leitao, 2012; Sutherland & Gillon, 2005). Within this study, measures
of PR accuracy are used to test predictions that follow from the theoretical accounts
discussed above.
Measures of PR segmentation

The second category of measures aims to assess the level of segmentation of
children's representations. One of the most direct measures of PR segmentation
is the gating task developed by Grosjean (1980). The rationale here is that if

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Ainsworth et al.: Lexical restructuring in preliterate children

1004

children's PRs are less segmented than adults', they will need to hear more of
the word before they are able to recognize it. This has been shown to be the case
(Elliot, Hammer, & Evan, 1987; Walley, 1988; Walley, Michela, & Wood, 1995),
providing support for the LRM, although more recent studies have questioned the
reliability of the gating task for measuring PRs in young children (Sutherland &
Gillon, 2005; Wesseling & Reitsma, 2001). Wesseling and Reitsma (2001) found
gating to be a poor predictor of phonological awareness and to give inconsistent
results at retest, while in Sutherland and Gillon's (2005) study, gating performance
did not differentiate between children with specific language impairment and the
control group.
Another way to look for evidence of PR segmentation is to investigate position
effects in speech processing tasks. For example, while adults have been found to
detect initial mispronunciations more easily than mispronunciations elsewhere in
a word, children are less sensitive to the position of the mispronunciation (Cole &
Perfetti, 1980; Walley, 1987). This finding has been interpreted as evidence that
children's PRs are less segmented than adults', with children needing to focus on
the whole word rather than being able to rely on the onset as adults appear to do
(Metsala & Walley, 1998).
The tasks outlined above all seek to measure the segmentation of PRs in the
most intuitive sense; that is, they assess the extent to which the representations
are stored in terms of separable chunks (whether words are stored as a holistic
whole word template, e.g., "/kaet/"; as an onset and a rime segment "/k/-/aet/";
or as three separate phonemes, "/k/-/ae/-/t/"). However, other authors have operationalized PR segmentation differently, in terms of the degree of specification
of each segment. For example, in Storkel's (2002) strong restructuring account, a
consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) word from a sparse neighborhood (i.e., one
with few phonological neighbors) like "boom" will be stored in terms of three
segments from infancy, but the final segment /m/ will initially be coded coarsely
as simply /nasal/. At this stage of development, the final segment of the word is
indistinct from other nasals. It is only later in childhood when the final segment
will be stored phonemically. Evidence in support of this strong restructuring account comes from similarity judgment tasks where children are asked to make
classifications about interword similarity (Carroll & Myers, 2011; Storkel, 2002).
The rationale behind similarity judgment tasks is that by finding out which types
of words children classify as being similar, we can make inferences about the way
that the words are stored within their lexicon.
Nonword repetition has also been used as a measure of PR segmentation (Coady
& Aslin, 2004), although the extent to which a nonword repetition task taps
into stored phonological representations is unclear. Although nonword repetition
was traditionally thought of as being a pure measure of phonological short-term
memory (PSTM) that is free from lexical influences, it has been argued that
nonword repetition taps into both lexical and sublexical processes and can be used
as a probe into children's stored representations (Coady & Aslin, 2004; Coady &
Evans, 2008).
We have seen above that theoretical accounts of PR development make different
predictions about if and how the accuracy and level of segmentation of children's
PRs change over development. Previous studies have tended to focus on either

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Ainsworth et al.: Lexical restructuring in preliterate children

1005

PR accuracy or PR segmentation and have not measured both within the same
sample. This study has measured both aspects of PR quality concurrently alongside
measures of both expressive and receptive vocabulary size.
Four of the PR tasks are receptive, eliminating the potential confound of speech
output difficulties. The receptive PR tasks have also been designed to be as implicit
as possible so that they do not require any explicit knowledge of phonemes. In
this way, we were able to test some of the predictions made by the LRM and to
investigate the relationships between the different PR measures.
AIMS

The current study used measures of PR accuracy and segmentation in nursery children (aged 3 years, 6 months [3;6] to 4;6) to investigate the following questions:
1. Is there evidence in support of vocabulary-driven restructuring (in the form of a
relationship between vocabulary size and PR segmentation)?
2. What is the level of segmentation of nursery children's PRs?
3. What are the core underlying capacities that determine performance on PR measures?
METHOD
Participants

Thirty-eight children were recruited from the nursery classes of three mainstream,
state-run schools with low, medium, and high sociodemographic status (as indexed
by the proportion of free school meals). Children's ages ranged between 3;6 and
4;6 with an average age of 4;1. There was an equal number of males and females.
Children with known hearing difficulties (as reported by the teacher) and children
on the special educational needs register for speech, language, or developmental
issues were excluded from the study. Only children speaking English as their first
language with at least one English-speaking parent/carer at home were included
in the study. All children within the study spoke British English, although there
were a variety of accents within the sample.
Procedure

Children were tested individually in a quiet area within school over three sessions
each lasting between 30 and 45 min. All tasks requiring a verbal response were
audiorecorded for checking purposes.
The two repetition tasks, which were relatively short, were always administered
in full, regardless of performance. For all other tasks, a stopping criterion was
applied to avoid unnecessary testing: if after eight items the child was scoring
at or below chance, the test was aborted at this point. This criterion affected
five children on the initial sound task and one child on the mispronunciation
reconstruction and detection tasks. Across all tasks corrective feedback was given
for training items only.

All experimental tasks used target words and distracters selected to be familiar to
nursery children. For all tasks involving visual stimuli, the children were asked to
name the pictures to check that they had identified them correctly; when children
were unable to name the picture, the experimenter told them the correct name.
For each task, test trials were preceded by one or more practice items. All
experimental tasks used two different orders to control for order effects, and the
physical position of the target item in tasks using visual stimuli was randomized.
The stimuli list for each task and detailed information on the protocol and selection

Measures of the children's expressive and receptive vocabulary were taken using
the Renfrew Word Finding Vocabulary Test (Renfrew, 1995) and the British Picture
Vocabulary Scale (BPVS; Dunn et al., 2009), respectively. The delivery of the
BPVS test was slightly different from the standard method in that all children
started from Set 1, regardless of age. This was to allow raw scores to be compared
across 3- and 4-year-old children.
Measures of phonological representation

A battery of six measures was developed, which was designed to probe the
level of segmentation and the accuracy of children's phonological representations
(Table 1). The battery includes four receptive measures (which do not require a
verbal response) and two expressive measures.

Receptive PR measures.

In this novel task, children were asked to select which
picture (out of a choice of four) they thought a puppet wanted after hearing it
say an initial sound; for example, the child heard /p/ and chose from the target
picture, paint, and three distracters: bed, toilet, and rug (see Figure 1a). The task
was designed to measure PR segmentation with the rationale that children would
only be able to identify the word from its initial sound if their PRs were segmented
at least at the onset-rime level. The stimuli for the initial sound task were spoken
live to the child by the experimenter (pretending to be the puppet).
This task is similar to the "phoneme identification" task that often appears in batteries testing explicit phonological awareness (e.g., Elbro & Petersen, 2004), where
the child is shown pictures of objects and is asked, "Which one starts with . . . "
Both tasks require children to access their PRs given that they are "silent" tasks
(where the tester does not provide a spoken example of the test words). The key
difference between the two tasks is that in the initial sound task the child is not
asked explicitly to operate on phonemes; rather they are simply asked to guess
what the puppet wants. This distinction is important because it follows that while
the phoneme identification task used in previous studies taps explicit PA, this novel
task has the potential to tap the segmentation of PRs before PA emerges.

INITIAL SOUND TASK.

The two
measures of mispronunciation detection and mispronunciation reconstruction were
combined within one task for ease of administration. The detection component
probes PR accuracy, but the reconstruction element probes the level of segmentation of children's PRs.
Children were asked to identify whether or not a word was pronounced correctly
(mispronunciation detection) by an on-screen alien. The stimuli were prerecordings of the experimenter saying the correct and incorrect forms of the word.
Mispronunciations deviated from the target word by a single phoneme substitution or deletion. The rationale here is that children will only be able to detect
minimally contrasting mispronunciations if they are storing the phonological word
forms accurately. In contrast, if a child has "fuzzy" underspecified representations
of words, we would expect them to score poorly on mispronunciation detection.
Similar measures of mispronunciation detection used in previous studies have
been shown to be reliable, valid measures of PR accuracy with the potential to
identify children at risk of later literacy problems (Claessen et al., 2009).
For those words that were mispronounced by the puppet, the child was then
asked to identify the target word (from a choice of four pictures) from the mispronounced form (mispronunciation reconstruction). For example, the child hears
/pg/ and decides whether the puppet was trying to say pig (target), pen, dog, or
bowl (see Figure 1b). While the target word differed from the mispronunciation
by only a single phoneme substitution/addition, the distracters all involved at least
two phoneme substitutions. It is assumed that success on this task requires the
child to compare each of the four words with the mispronunciation and to select
the one that is most phonologically similar. It is further assumed that the child will
only be able to do this if his or her PRs of the words are segmented.

correctly?

The mispronunciation reconstruction component is a novel measure of PR
segmentation that was developed as a way to probe the level of segmentation of
children's PRs without requiring any explicit awareness of sound structure (PA).
The mispronunciation reconstruction task is superficially similar to Fowler and
Swainson's (2004) "correction of naming errors" task (a variant of articulation
correction), where children are also asked to listen to a mispronunciation and
identify which picture the character is trying to say. However, the two tasks are
designed to measure different aspects of PR ability and, accordingly, involve
different task demands. The correction of naming errors task aims to measure
PR precision rather than segmentation and so does not manipulate phonological
similarity between the stimuli and the distracters as the reconstruction task does.
The emphasis in the correction of naming errors task is on how well the child
corrects the word not on the child's ability to identify which word it is. The
distracters are therefore more distant from the target word (varying in holistic
features such as word length and prosody) than they are in the reconstruction task
(where the distracters vary in terms of phonology alone).
Children were asked to choose which
of two pronunciations was the correct production for a pictured item (see
Figure 1c). For example, the child hears two on-screen aliens try to say rain (/ren/).
While one alien pronounces the word correctly, the other says /ten/. Again the
stimuli were spoken and prerecorded by the experimenter. This task was included
to complement the more commonly used mispronunciation detection task, because
of the potential increase in sensitivity afforded by two alternative-choice methods
over yes-no paradigms (MacMillan & Creelman, 2005).
Each of the four receptive PR tasks consisted of 24 items (see online-only
supplementary materials for stimuli lists).
MISPRONUNCIATION DECISION TASK.

Expressive PR tasks.

In the word repetition task,
children were asked to repeat 40 prerecorded CVC words (spoken by the experimenter). In the nonword repetition task, children were asked to repeat 40
CVC nonwords (again spoken by the experimenter and prerecorded. The nonword
stimuli list was generated by changing the vowels in the word repetition stimuli
list. The proportion of short versus long vowels or diphthongs was matched for
the word and nonword stimuli. Children were only scored as correct if they pronounced the whole of the word/nonword correctly. For both tasks, the children
were asked to repeat three training words (also CVC) before the testing phase
began, to ensure that they had understood the task.
Word and nonword repetitions were included to allow us to investigate children's
performance on expressive as well as receptive measures and to allow us to
replicate Vance et al.'s (2005) finding that young children process words and
nonwords in the same way. Word repetition has been used previously as a measure
of PR accuracy, the idea being that in repetition, the child's existing representation
is activated that in turn drives production of the corresponding motor program
(e.g., Vance et al., 2005). It is assumed that for a child to correctly repeat a word,

WORD AND NONWORD REPETITION TASKS.

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Ainsworth et al.: Lexical restructuring in preliterate children

1010

the child's PR for that word must be stored accurately. Nonword repetition, in
contrast, is traditionally considered to be a measure of PR segmentation. It is
assumed that when children are asked to repeat a nonword stimulus for which they
do not have an existing lexical representation, they need to mentally segment the
word form into phonological chunks (e.g., phonemes or onset-rime segments) so
that they can access the required motor programs and then reassemble them ready
for production (Vance et al., 2005).
However, note that although word repetition is traditionally assumed to measure
"top down" lexical level processes and nonword repetition is thought to involve
"bottom up" segmental processes, Vance et al.'s (2005) findings suggest that young
children may use segmental processes for repetition of words and nonwords. Coady
and Evans (2008) also suggested that nonword repetition is not a purely segmental
process; rather, nonword repetition performance is also affected by children's
existing representations for known words. By including both word and nonword
repetition within the battery, we are able to compare children's performance on
the two measures and investigate whether or not the two measures seem to be
measuring different processes. Although the word and nonword repetition tasks
are given their traditional labels as measures of PR accuracy and segmentation
within Table 1, we acknowledge there is ambiguity surrounding the degree to
which lexical/sublexical processing comes into play within the two tasks. By
including both tasks within the battery, using equivalent stimuli, we are able to
compare children's performance on the two measures and investigate whether the
two measures seem to be measuring different processes.
RESULTS
Data preparation

The raw scores for all experimental tasks were converted into the percentage of
correct responses. The BPVS and word finding scores were kept in raw form
because the number of items administered to each child is dependent on performance. For the mispronunciation reconstruction task, the percentage of correct
responses was calculated for the mispronounced items only.
Five task scores were identified from the boxplot (Figure 2) as potential outliers,
with values more than 1.5 times the interquartile range below the first quartile.
Following inspection of the raw data, two children were excluded listwise and one
participant's score on the nonword repetition task was substituted with the mean.
There were five cases where children withdrew from a task having completed
fewer than eight items. These missing scores were also substituted with the mean
value for that task, as recommended by Field (2009, p. 654).
Description of performance on the PR tasks

The descriptive statistics for performance on the six PR tasks and the two vocabulary measures are presented in Table 2. For the mispronunciation detection
and decision tasks, both accuracy scores (% correct) and measures of sensitivity are reported. Values of d  were calculated for the mispronunciation detection

and decision tasks to separate the child's sensitivity to mispronunciations from
any response bias that the child might have, in line with signal detection theory
(MacMillan & Creelman, 2005).
Summary data for the receptive PR tasks

The four receptive PR tasks each consisted of 24 items. According to the binomial
distribution, a score of 16 or above on the detection and decision tasks (which
both involve two choices) is considered to be significantly above chance. For the
initial sound and mispronunciation reconstruction tasks (which both involve four
choices), a score of 10 or above is considered to be significantly above chance.
The percentages of children scoring above chance (shown in Table 2) indicate that
the majority of these preschool children were capable of detecting and making
judgments about mispronunciations within one-syllable words, reconstructing a
target word from its mispronunciation and identifying a whole word target from
its initial sound (although they were not at ceiling level on any task).

Effect of mispronunciation type

Metsala and Walley (1998) proposed that differential mispronunciation detection
performance for items involving initial substitutions versus mispronunciations
elsewhere in the word is indicative of the level of PR segmentation. If children's
PRs are restructured by vocabulary growth, we might expect children with higher
vocabularies to detect mispronunciations in initial position more readily and for
children with lower vocabularies to be unaffected by the position of the mispronunciation. We might also expect to see an interaction between vocabulary size
and position effects for the mispronunciation decision and mispronunciation reconstruction tasks. To test these predictions, the difference between the percentage
of items correct where the mispronunciation was in the initial position minus the
percentage of items correct where the mispronunciation was in the medial or final
position was calculated for each child (performance on items involving deletion
of consonants from consonant clusters was omitted from this analysis) for each of
the three mispronunciation tasks. Children were then separated into two groups
of low and high expressive vocabulary (word finding score) using a median split.
On the mispronunciation detection task, the low vocabulary group performed
equally well on items involving initial substitutions and substitutions in other positions (i.e., medial and final), t (20) = 0.27, p = .40, while the high vocabulary
group performed better on initial substitutions than on medial/final substitutions,
t (14) = 2.03, p = .031. On the mispronunciation reconstruction task, both high
vocabulary and low vocabulary groups performed equally well on initial mispronunciation items and items with the mispronunciation in the medial/final position,
low: t (20) = 1.33, p = .099; high: t (14) = 1.41, p = .09. On the mispronunciation

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Ainsworth et al.: Lexical restructuring in preliterate children

1013

decision task, there was no effect of mispronunciation position for either the low or
high vocabulary group, low: t (17) = 0.86, p = .40; high: t (17) = 0.00, p = 1.00.
When we group the children according to receptive vocabulary (again using
a median split but with the BPVS scores), we find that on the mispronunciation
detection task children, there are no position effects for either the low or high
vocabulary groups, low: t (16) = 0.54, p = .30; high: t (18) = 1.45, p = .08. On
the mispronunciation reconstruction task, there is a significant effect of position for
the high vocabulary group, t (18) = 2.05, p = .028, but not for the low vocabulary
group, t (16) = 0.62, p = .54. Once again, no position effects were found for the
mispronunciation decision task, low: t (13) = 1.54, p = .15; high: t (18) = -0.66,
p = .52. The lack of a position effect on the mispronunciation decision task could
be because many children scored highly on this task, with the children with higher
vocabularies performing especially well. Because of this, the difference between
performance on mispronunciations in initial versus medial or final position tended
to be small, especially for the children with higher vocabularies.
Comparison of word and nonword repetition performance

Word and nonword repetition tasks were compared, in an attempt to replicate
Vance et al.'s (2005) finding that 3-year-olds perform equally well on the two
types of repetition tasks, while 4-year-old children find it easier to repeat words
than nonwords. Analysis of variance was carried out on the word and nonword
repetition percentage scores with children grouped according to age (3 years, N =
14; 4 years, N = 24). No significant main effect of task was found, F (1, 33) =
0.003, p = .96, indicating that children performed equally well on the word and
nonword repetition tasks. A marginally significant main effect of age was found,
F (1, 33) = 4.07, p = .054, with 4-year-olds performing better than 3-year-olds.
There was no significant interaction of task with age, F (1, 33) = 0.003, p = .96.
Factor analysis

Factor analysis was conducted on the PR task scores to investigate the underlying
capacities involved in PR performance. The PR tasks were designed to measure
the accuracy and level of segmentation of children's PRs. We would, therefore,
expect at least one factor to emerge, representing PR quality. If the lexical restructuring hypothesis holds, the predicted factor(s) would also be expected to correlate
with measures of receptive and expressive vocabulary (Metsala & Walley, 1998).
In order to test this prediction, factor analysis was performed on six variables
representing performance on the six PR task scores: initial sound, mispronunciation reconstruction, mispronunciation detection, mispronunciation decision, word
repetition, and nonword repetition (with the sensitivity measure d  rather than
percentage accuracy used for the mispronunciation detection and decision tasks
to control for the effect of response bias). The measures of receptive and expressive vocabulary were not included in the factor analysis so that they could be
used as predictors of the factor scores, thus providing an independent test of the
interpretation of the factor model.

The preliminary stage of the analysis involved examination of the correlations between task scores as reported in Table 3. The four receptive PR tasks
designed to measure PR accuracy (the mispronunciation detection task and the
mispronunciation decision task) and PR segmentation (the initial sound task and
mispronunciation reconstruction task) each correlated significantly with at least
one of the vocabulary measures, in line with the LRM. The expressive repetition
tasks, however, did not correlate with either vocabulary measure.
Significant nonnormality was found for the sensitivity scores for the mispronunciation detection, D (36) = 0.16, p = .03, and mispronunciation decision tasks,
D (33) = 0.16, p = .03, and for the word repetition accuracy scores, D (36) = 0.16,
p = .02. This motivated use of the principal axis factoring method that is preferable
for use in cases of significant nonnormality (Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &
Strahan, 1999). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (0.63) was above the acceptable threshold of 0.5 (Field, 2009, p. 659), confirming sampling adequacy for the
analysis. The Bartlett test of sphericity was significant, 2 (15) = 46.98, p < .0005,
indicating that the correlations between variables were sufficiently high for factor
analysis to be conducted. Two factors were retained in line with Kaiser's criterion
of eigenvalues >1 (Kaiser, 1960). The scree plot (see online-only Supplementary
Materials) was also inspected, confirming that two factors would yield the optimal
solution. Together the factors explained 48.55% of the variance.
Direct oblimin rotation was employed initially to check the orthogonality of the
factors. The correlation between the factors was found to be nonsignificant (r = .23
p = .18, two tailed) motivating employment of varimax orthogonal rotation (see
Figure 3) for ease of interpretation. Table 4 shows the factor matrix after varimax
rotation with loadings >0.32 shown in bold (using the rule of thumb that loadings
over 0.32 have substantive importance; e.g., Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007).

If low loadings are ignored (<0.32), the mispronunciation decision and detection tasks load onto Factor 1 only, the two repetition tasks load onto Factor 2 only,
and the initial sound and mispronunciation reconstruction tasks load onto both
factors. In an attempt to interpret the meaning of the two factors, the commonalities and differences between the demands of the six tasks were considered. The
two tasks loading highly onto Factor 1, mispronunciation detection and decision,
both test children's ability to identify whether a word is spoken correctly. The
two tasks loading highly onto Factor 2 both test the child's ability to listen to

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4

1016

a speech signal and repeat it, but the interpretation cannot simply relate to production because the initial sound and mispronunciation reconstruction tasks load
moderately onto both factors. The two factors, therefore, need to be interpreted in
terms of two skills/abilities that are both required for the initial sound and mispronunciation reconstruction tasks but that discriminate between the repetition tasks
and the mispronunciation detection/decision tasks. While Factor 1 is proposed to
represent PR quality, two alternative possibilities for the interpretation of Factor
2 are proposed: PSTM and segmental processing (see Discussion).
If the lexical restructuring hypothesis is correct, we would expect the factor
scores for the PR quality factor to correlate significantly with vocabulary. This
prediction is borne out in a correlational analysis with Factor 1 correlating moderately with both measures of vocabulary (word finding: r = .47, p = .002; BPVS:
r = .42, p = .005). This relationship remains significant when controlling for age
(word finding: r = .39, p = .01; BPVS: r = .39, p = .01). While the correlation between expressive vocabulary and Factor 2 was marginally significant (r =
.23, p = .09), Factor 2 did not correlate significantly with receptive vocabulary
(r = .041, p = .41). Factor 2 did not correlate significantly with either vocabulary
measure when controlling for age (word finding: r = .13, p = .22; BPVS: r =
-.002, p = .50). Unless stated otherwise, all the significance values above are
one tailed because the corresponding a priori predictions were directional (i.e., all
relationships were expected to be positive).
DISCUSSION

In this study we have used four receptive tasks and two repetition tasks to investigate the accuracy and level of segmentation of nursery children's phonological
representations. While a number of studies have explored the development of
phonological representations, they have tended to look at either PR accuracy (e.g.,
Anthony et al., 2010; Claessen et al., 2009) or PR segmentation (e.g., Foy & Mann,
2009), but not both. Furthermore, most studies have been restricted to children
who have already begun reading instruction, or have used measures that probe
sensitivity to phones rather than phonemic representation. The current study has
measured PR accuracy and segmentation concurrently within the same sample
and has provided evidence of lexical restructuring in preliterate children as young
as 3;6.
Evidence of PR segmentation in preliterate children

Performance on the initial sound task provides evidence that the PRs of nursery
children (aged 3;6 to 4;6) are segmented at least at the onset-rime level, with
children performing well above floor levels on this task. If children's PRs were
stored holistically, we would not expect them to be able to relate an isolated initial
sound segment to their whole-word template of the target item. It is assumed
that for success on this task, the initial sound needs to be separable from the
rest of the word within the child's phonological representation. It is worth noting
that the scores were not at ceiling for this task and that there was considerable
variation in performance across participants. This indicates that children do not

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Ainsworth et al.: Lexical restructuring in preliterate children

1017

find linking an initial sound to its whole-word referent a trivial task. Scores showed
the highest correlation with age, suggesting that this skill is still developing within
the preschool period.
All of the children performed above chance on the mispronunciation reconstruction task, which requires sensitivity to the number of shared segments between the
stimulus and the target word. If we assume that this sensitivity requires (or is at
least facilitated by) segmented PRs, then the high levels of performance observed
within this sample provide further support for PR segmentation in nursery children. It is possible that children might be able to carry out the task to some extent
using holistic representations, with children selecting the word that is most similar
overall rather than in terms of shared segments. However, it would be difficult
to explain why the mispronunciation reconstruction task clusters with the initial
sound task if they are not both measures of segmentation.

Evidence in support of vocabulary driven restructuring

We have presented evidence consistent with the view that children's phonological representations are segmented before they enter formal education. In order to
distinguish between the accessibility and emergent viewpoints, we need to know
if the level of segmentation of children's PRs is dependent on vocabulary size,
while controlling for age. If children's PRs have been segmented from infancy, we
would not expect measures of PR segmentation to correlate with vocabulary. If, in
contrast, PRs only become segmented gradually as the child's lexicon expands, we
would expect to see a significant relationship between vocabulary size and measures of PR segmentation. All four receptive PR measures correlated significantly
with expressive vocabulary, with three out of the four correlating with receptive
vocabulary. This is consistent with the LRM's proposition that children's representations of words will increase in terms of both accuracy and segmentedness under
the pressure of a growing vocabulary (Metsala & Walley, 1998). Further evidence
in support of the LRM is that position effects were found on the mispronunciation
detection task for children with high but not low expressive vocabularies and on
the mispronunciation reconstruction task for children with high but not low receptive vocabularies. This is in line with previous studies that show adults to be more
sensitive to position effects in mispronunciation detection than are children (Cole
& Perfetti, 1980; Walley, 1987).
The results are also consistent with PRIMIR, which predicts that phonemic representation emerges gradually as children learn more words and regularities appear
across the word form plane (Werker & Curtin, 2005). Although PRIMIR does not
predict PR accuracy to be vocabulary dependent (children's representations are
assumed to be very detailed from the beginning), the relationship between vocabulary and measures of PR accuracy could be explained in terms of vocabulary
mediating the lensing effect of the child's level of development. Within PRIMIR,
the child's developmental level (something that may potentially be indexed by
vocabulary size) acts as a filter that determines the degree to which certain levels
of information are processed during certain tasks. In summary, the current findings support the idea of emerging phonemic representation in preliterate children

driven by vocabulary growth and are consistent with both the LRM (Metsala &
Walley, 1998) and PRIMIR (Werker & Curtin, 2005).
What is the relationship between the different PR measures?

The six PR tasks were devised to provide measures of the accuracy and level of
segmentation of preschool children's PRs. It was predicted that factor analysis
would yield at least one factor representing PR quality that would correlate significantly with vocabulary in line with the LRM. This prediction was confirmed, with
two factors emerging: one representing PR quality and a second factor that lends
itself to one of two interpretations: PSTM or segmental processing. Interpretation
of the two factors was made on the basis of the demands associated with each task.
When labeling the factors, we considered which task demands were shared
by the four receptive tasks but not by the two repetition tasks. The key property that the four receptive tasks share is that they all require the child to compare the heard stimulus with the stored representations for the words shown
in the picture choices. It follows that they all require accurate PRs, yielding
the PR quality label for Factor 1. The key property that the two segmentation
tasks share with the nonword repetition is that they all require the child to hold
the stimulus in PSTM while some degree of segmental processing takes place.
For the initial sound task, children need to retain the heard segment in PSTM (s)
while they access the PRs for the four picture choices. They then need to compare
the segment with each of the initial segments for the four word choices in search
of a match. For the mispronunciation reconstruction task, children need to hold
the mispronunciation in PSTM, and access their existing PRs for each picture and
then for the closest segmental match. For the nonword repetition task, children
need to retain the stimulus in memory, break it down into its constituent segments,
and then reassemble it into the required motor plans (e.g., Vance et al., 2005). The
mispronunciation detection and decision tasks are unlikely to require segmental
processing, with children making judgments based on a simple search of their
lexicon to see if the stimulus matches an existing entry. It is assumed here that
the mispronunciation detection and decision tasks can be completed by holistic
rather than segmental comparisons (Metsala & Walley, 1998) and are, therefore,
less taxing in terms of phonological processing.
Given that nonword repetition and the two receptive PR segmentation tasks are
likely to place the greatest demands on PSTM, it therefore makes sense to label the
factor onto which these three tasks load as PSTM. However, we need to consider
how word repetition fits in with this interpretation and explain why a task that is
generally considered to be predominantly lexical (rather than sublexical) might
load onto PSTM but not PR quality. That word repetition clusters with nonword
repetition and does not load onto PR quality supports the suggestion made by
Vance et al. (2005) that younger children adopt a sublexical bottom-up strategy to
repetition. Although Vance et al. (2005) found evidence of lexical influences on
repetition in 4-year-olds, the children in our sample were 4;6 and younger, and it
may be that top-down effects on word repetition only begin to appear between 4;6
and 5;0. If this is the case, then both word and nonword repetition tasks in young
children may be measuring sublexical rather than lexical processing.

It is also worth noting that the correlation between Factor 2 and vocabulary was
not as high as we might expect given the well-established link between PSTM and
vocabulary that can be found within the literature (e.g., Gathercole, Service, Hitch,
Adams, & Martin, 1999; Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1992). While
the two receptive segmentation tasks both correlated significantly with expressive
vocabulary, the two repetition tasks did not. This discrepancy is likely because the
CVC words used were not sufficiently complex to be sensitive to this association.
Gathercole and Adams (1993) found a significant correlation between repetition
and vocabulary for words of two syllables and longer, and nonwords of three
syllables and longer, but not for shorter items. It is also worth noting that the
children taking part in this study were younger than the children within many of
the studies where an association between PSTM and vocabulary has been shown
(e.g., Gathercole et al., 1992, 1999). It is possible that the association observed
between PSTM and vocabulary size within older samples may be driven at least
to some extent by literacy.
An alternative interpretation of Factor 2 is that the factor does not measure PSTM
but does measure some other element of segmental processing. We suggest that
within the current study, the repetition stimuli were not complex enough to make
significant demands on PSTM but were complex enough to engage other aspects of
segmental processing. One possibility is that the repetition tasks were sensitive to
the coarseness of the final segment within the word. According to Storkel's (2002)
strong restructuring account, children represent the ends of words from sparse
neighborhoods in less detail than the preceding segments; for example, "boom"
might be stored as /b-u, -nasal/. In order to verify this possibility, further work is
needed to explore the effects of neighborhood density on repetition performance
and to investigate whether the factor structure changes when repetition measures
involving more complex stimuli (i.e., multisyllabic words/nonwords) are used.

Conclusions

This study has used novel implicit measures of PR segmentation alongside measures of PR accuracy and vocabulary size to provide clear evidence of restructuring
in children aged 3;6 to 4;6. The findings have two key theoretical implications.
First, the findings suggest that children's PRs are emergent, with PRs becoming
increasingly accurate and segmented over development. This is in contrast with
the accessibility viewpoint that proposes that PRs are phonemic from infancy.
Second, the findings suggest that PR restructuring is driven predominantly by
vocabulary growth, as predicted by the LRM (Metsala & Walley, 1998) with the
PR quality factor correlating significantly with vocabulary even when controlling
for age. Although it is possible that this restructuring may be driven at least in
part by literacy experience (c.f. Ziegler & Goswami, 2005), that restructuring was
found within this sample of children who have not yet received formal reading
instruction suggests that it is vocabulary growth that plays the key role in the
restructuring of children's phonological representations. The results are consistent
with both the LRM (Metsala & Walley, 1998) and the PRMIR framework (Werker
& Curtin, 2005).
