Older adults often show a positivity bias effect during picture processing, focusing more on positive than negative
information. It is unclear whether this positivity bias effect generalizes to language and whether arousal matters.
The present study investigated how age affects emotional word comprehension with varied valence (positive,
negative) and arousal (high, low). We recorded older and younger participants' brainwaves (EEG) while they
read positive/negative and high/low-arousing words and pseudowords, and made word/non-word judgments.
Older adults showed increased N400s and left frontal alpha decreases (300-450 ms) for low-arousing positive as
compared to low-arousing negative words, suggesting an arousal-dependent positivity bias during lexical
retrieval. Both age groups showed similar LPPs to negative words. Older adults further showed a larger midfrontal theta increase (500-700 ms) than younger adults for low-arousing negative words, possibly indicating
down-regulation of negative meanings of low-arousing words. Altogether, our data supported the strength and
vulnerability integration model of aging.

1. Introduction
Do older adults comprehend emotional language differently from
younger adults? Some behavioral studies have shown that older adults
have greater attention to and better memory for positive stimuli than
negative ones, termed as the positivity bias effect (Reed et al., 2014). In
contrast, others showed that older adults have reduced attention or
memory for negative stimuli over positive ones, reflecting a reduced
negativity bias effect (Gruhn et al., 2007; Jacques et al., 2010). Most of
these studies examined emotional faces and scenes in attention or
memory paradigms (e.g., Charles et al., 2003; Isaacowitz et al., 2006a,
2006b; Mather & Carstensen, 2003, 2005). The present study examined
how older adults perceive positive and negative content in language.
1.1. Theoretical frameworks for the age-related positivity bias effect
There are three theories regarding the positivity bias effect in older
adults (Carstensen & DeLiema, 2018). According to the socioemotional
selectivity theory (SST) (Carstensen, 2006), older people's time horizons
about the future become increasingly constrained, which alters their
motivation, priorities, and goals. As such, their social goals may shift

from acquiring information or meeting new people, to the search for
emotional meaning, regulation, and satisfaction (Reed & Carstenson,
2012). The SST theory thus argues for a more top-down, controlled shift
in attentional resources toward goal-relevant (i.e., positive) stimuli in
older individuals. The cognitive control hypothesis (CCH) (Nashiro
et al., 2012) argues that older adults' preference for emotional wellbeing results from their increased devotion of cognitive resources to
emotion regulation. Empirically, supporting CCH, older adults had more
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity for positive pictures than
negative ones, when they were deeply engaged in the task (Ritchey
et al., 2011). Older adults also showed increased amygdala-mPFC or
amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) functional coupling during
various tasks, including rest, free viewing, and actively down-regulating
negative pictures (Jacques et al., 2010; Sakaki, Nga, & Mather, 2013;
Sakaki, Yoo, et al., 2016; Urry et al., 2006).
The strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI) model posits that
the positivity bias effect in older adults can be modulated by the in
tensity of emotion (i.e. arousal), and the stages of the emotional expe
rience (i.e., before, during, or after the event, Charles, 2010). For lowarousing events, older adults show the strengths in using attentional,
appraisal, or behavioral strategies to regulate negative events, leading to

2000; Schupp et al., 2000), associating the LPP with re-allocation of
attention to emotional content. Others found that negative pictures
elicited larger LPPs than positive ones (Foti et al., 2009; Wood & Kisley,
2006), associating the LPP with a negativity bias in younger adults who
typically zoom in to negative information. In older adults (56-81 years),
such picture LPP effect was smaller, albeit still statistically significant
(Kisley et al., 2007; Wood & Kisley, 2006). Kisley and colleagues argued
that this suggests that older adults used emotion regulation to reduce the
negativity bias. This is consistent with the idea that older adults have a
reduced negativity bias, which might be thought of as the "weak" form
of the positivity bias.
While no ERP study of words examined the positivity bias effect in
older adults, there are many ERP studies of emotional words in younger
adults, which can inform us about relevant ERP correlates: the early
posterior negativity (EPN), N400, LPP, and sustained slow positivity
(SSP). Emotional words (both positive and negative) usually elicit a
larger EPN (200-300 ms) than neutral words, which is linked to an
initial arousal-driven, automatic processing of emotional stimuli
(Hinojosa et al., 2010; Palazova et al., 2011; Recio et al., 2014; Sass
et al., 2010; Schacht & Sommer, 2009a). A few studies further found that
emotional words (positive and negative) elicit a reduced, frontal N400
(300-500 ms) compared with neutral words (Kanske & Kotz, 2007).
Because N400 reflects semantic retrieval effort, the reduced N400 re
flects a facilitation of semantic retrieval due to the emotional content
(Ku et al., 2020). Emotional words also often elicit a larger LPP than
neutral words, albeit with a peak between 400 and 750 ms, earlier than
pictures (Carretie et al., 2008; Hinojosa et al., 2010; Kanske & Kotz,
2007; Schacht & Sommer, 2009a). While these earlier studies showed no
LPP difference between positive and negative words, recent studies
found a larger LPP for negative relative to positive words in both eval
uative and lexical decision tasks (Delaney-Busch et al., 2016; Ku et al.,
2020), indicative of a negativity bias in younger adults. Some studies
additionally reported a long-lasting SSP from 700 to 1000 ms for
emotional (versus neutral) words, with a centro-parietal scalp distribu
tion (Citron et al., 2013; Dillon et al., 2006). Both the LPP and SSP effects
in word studies have been linked to both elaborative processing and
sustained attention to emotional content, without a clear functional
dissociation.
To summarize, the one fMRI finding suggests that older adults
devoted more effort in processing positive words, supporting a positivity
bias. The ERP findings from pictures suggest that older adults reduced
their emotional responses to negative pictures, also consistent with a
positivity bias. However, it remains unknown how the age-related pos
itivity bias influences different stages in emotional word processing.

a more positive emotional experience (i.e., a positivity bias). In contrast,
for high-arousing events, older adults show the vulnerability in modu
lating high levels of physiological arousal of both positive and negative
emotions efficiently, due to reduced physiological flexibility (e.g., slow
physiological arousal or responses). This usually leads to a similar level
of intensity (i.e., no positivity bias) when older and younger adults
experience high-arousing events. Evidence supporting the SAVI model
comes from both behavioral and neuroimaging studies. Behaviorally,
older adults often rated low-arousing negative pictures as being less
unpleasant, and low-arousing positive pictures as more pleasant,
compared with younger adults (Streubel & Kunzmann, 2011). Lowarousing negative stimuli were also recalled less than arousal-matched
positive stimuli in older adults (Kensinger, 2008). For high-arousing
stimuli, negative pictures were rated more unpleasant by older than
by younger adults. However, in terms of memory recall and stimulus
detection, equal performance was often found between high-arousing
negative and positive stimuli (Kensinger, 2008; Mather & Knight,
2006). Neurally, low-arousing negative stimuli engage more controlled
processes, while high-arousing negative stimuli capture attention more
automatically (Dolan, 2002; Kensinger & Corkin, 2004; Knight et al.,
2007; Mather & Knight, 2005). When viewing low-arousing negative
pictures, older adults showed decreased amygdala activity accompanied
by increased ventral ACC activity, compared with younger adults
(Dolcos et al., 2014). In addition, older adults' increased ventral ACC/
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity was associated with
reduced ratings for low arousing negative pictures. In contrast, both
younger and older adults recruited similar amygdala activity in response
to high-arousing negative pictures. In our view, the abovementioned
literature is consistent with an emotion regulation account of emotion
processing: Older adults may activate top-down emotion regulation
strategies to dampen the physiological arousal processes, but only with
low-arousing stimuli.
Summing up, the SST model draws on behavioral but not neural
evidence, whereas the CCH model draws on neural but not behavioral
evidence. Neither the SST nor the CCH examines arousal. The SAVI
model examines arousal, but there are only a few studies (3 behavioral
studies and 1 fMRI study). In addition, those studies focus on pictures,
not language. It is unclear if and how arousal modulates older adults'
positivity bias effect during word comprehension.
1.2. Neural processing of the age-related positivity effect in emotional
word/picture processing
To date, few studies have examined the neural processing of the agerelated positivity effect in language comprehension. One fMRI study
(Leclerc & Kensinger, 2011) compared the brain activation for
emotional pictures and words between younger (18-35 years) and older
adults (64-81 years). In a semantic judgment task, older adults showed
greater mPFC activity for positive than for negative words, and greater
amygdala activity for positive than for negative pictures, compared with
younger adults. The authors associated the mPFC activation with
cognitive control for positivity bias. Specifically, older adults elaborate
the verbal stimuli more, possibly in a self-referential fashion, as the
mPFC activity is associated with emotional aspects of text processing,
social information (i.e., self vs. other), and emotion memory (Ferstl
et al., 2005; Gutchess et al., 2007). The study thus highlighted the dif
ferences between pictures and words: Pictures elicit emotional response
more automatically, while words require controlled and elaborative
processing.
In the event-related potential (ERP) studies using emotional pictures,
older adults' positivity bias effect is associated with the late positive
potential (LPP, Kisley et al., 2007; Mathieu et al., 2014; Wood & Kisley,
2006). The LPP in picture studies is a positive-going brainwave peaking
between 400 and 900 ms after the picture onset, with a centro-parietal
scalp distribution. In younger adults, some found that both positive and
negative pictures elicited larger LPPs than neutral ones (Cuthbert et al.,

1.3. The time-frequency representations (TFRs) of emotional word
processing
While the ERP captures the time-locked activity that is phase-locked,
the TFR additionally captures time-locked activity that is either phaselocked or non-phase-locked which has been associated with cognitive
functions (Bastiaansen et al., 2012). Like the ERP literature, much of the
EEG TFR emotion research has focused on pictures and less on words.
Studies using pictures have reported effects in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz),
theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (>30 Hz)
-bands (De Cesarei & Codispoti, 2011; Guntekin & Basar, 2014; Gun
tekin & Tulay, 2014; Schubring & Schupp, 2019). Specifically, negative
pictures elicited increased beta and gamma responses compared to
positive and neutral ones in early time windows (100-250 ms; valence
effect). High-arousing (both positive and negative) pictures elicited
increased delta and theta responses compared to low-arousing (neutral)
stimuli in later time windows (200-1000 ms; arousal effect; Knyazev
et al., 2009). While high-frequency oscillations such as beta and gamma
are argued to reflect emotional integration between top-down and
bottom-up information, low-frequency oscillations in the delta band
reflect the perception and updating of emotionally salient stimuli,

be made without too much semantic demand and past literature in
dicates that cognitively demanding or explicitly evaluative tasks could
attenuate the positivity bias effect in older adults (Mather, 2006; Reed
et al., 2014). Using EEG, we also sought to learn more about whether
older adults show more or differential brain regions in comparison to
younger adults during emotional word processing.
Our predictions for the ERPs are as follows: Based on the SAVI model,
older adults would show a positivity bias (c.f., Leclerc & Kensinger,
2011) or a reduced negativity bias (c.f., Kisley et al., 2007; Wood &
Kisley, 2006) in processing words with a low level of physiological
arousal. We thus predicted that if the positivity bias holds, older adults
would have larger LPPs than younger adults in recognizing low-arousing
positive (LP) words. Alternatively, if the reduced negativity bias holds,
older adults could show attenuated LPPs in recognizing low-arousing
negative (LN) words compared with younger adults. By contrast, due
to inconsistent literature on high-arousing stimuli, we expected that
processing high-arousing words could lead to similar emotional re
sponses across age groups, with larger LPPs and/or SSPs to negative (vs.
positive) words to replicate the negativity bias often found in younger
adults (e.g., Citron et al. 2013). We also expected to replicate the
reduced N400s to emotional (vs. neutral) words, at least in younger
adults (Ku et al., 2020), and that older adults would show a decrease in
N400 amplitudes in general compared with younger adults (Kutas &
Iragui, 1998).
For the time-frequency analysis, if different levels of emotional
arousal capture attention differently in the lexical decision task, then
words of different arousal should show different theta/alpha oscillatory
patterns. We decided to focus on theta, because theta has been associ
ated with lexical semantic processing (300-500 ms, temporo-parietally
distributed), attention to emotion contents (>500 ms, temporoparietally distributed), and emotion regulation (mid-frontally distrib
uted). We also analyzed alpha, as it indicates general attention pro
cessing. Due to mixed findings in past literature (e.g., early theta
increase in Kryuchkova et al., 2012; late theta decrease in Sulpizio et al.,
2020), we did not have specific predictions for the directionality and
latency of the theta activity between high-arousing and low-arousing
words. As for alpha, we predicted that high-arousing words would
show an alpha desynchronization at a later stage, based on Wang and
Bastiaansen (2014). Based on the SAVI model, we further predicted that
if the positivity bias holds, older adults would have an increased theta
and/or decreased alpha compared with younger adults in recognizing LP
words at a later stage to reflect increased attention to LP contents.
Alternatively, if the reduced negativity bias holds, in recognizing LN
words, older adults would show a(n) decreased theta and/or increased
alpha to reflect decreased attention to LN contents, and/or an increased
mid-frontal theta to reflect top-down regulatory processes. For higharousing words, similar theta/alpha activity was expected across the
two age groups.

usually with pictures of high arousal (Guntekin & Basar, 2016; Knyazev,
2007, 2012). Particularly, theta has also been linked to top-down control
processes (Cavanagh & Frank, 2014). For instance, successful emotion
regulation using cognitive reappraisal increased the mid-frontal theta
power (Ertl et al., 2013). Researchers have associated theta oscillations
of different topographical distributions with memory, attention, and
emotion processes.
Studies using word stimuli have predominately focused on the theta
band. Semantically rich words (e.g., nouns and verbs) often elicited an
increased temporo-parietal theta compared with semantically lean
words (e.g., prepositions) or pseudowords (e.g., thaft) around 300-500
ms after word onsets, reflecting the retrieval of lexical-semantic infor
mation (Bastiaansen & Hagoort, 2006; Bastiaansen et al., 2005; Mar
inkovic et al., 2012). In emotional words specifically, in younger adults,
the theta power changes have been reported in both early and late time
windows. Kryuchkova et al. (2012) found that words with intermediate
danger ratings (4-6 on an 8-point scale) showed a mid-frontal theta
increase, but not words with low danger ratings, in an early time win
dow from 150 to 350 ms after word onsets. They suggested that the theta
increase reflects cortical processes initiated by subcortical routes due to
flight or fight responses to information in danger word. Sulpizio et al.
(2020) found a trend of temporo-parietal theta desynchronization to
negative words relative to neutral words in a later time window from
500 to 1500 ms. They suggested that the theta desynchronization re
flects attentional demand due to the emotional significance of the words.
Not every electrophysiological study of emotional language in
younger adults reported theta oscillations. Using magnetoencephalog
raphy (MEG), Hirata et al. (2007) found decreased beta and low gamma
(30-60 Hz) power for reading emotional (vs. neutral) words passively
during the 1-second period after word onsets over the ACC, left inferior
frontal gyurs (IFG), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG). These authors
attributed the results to emotion processing (ACC) and processing of
emotional connotations during reading (left IFG/MFG). They did not
distinguish the functional significance of beta and low gamma sepa
rately. Also not reporting theta, Wang and Bastiaansen (2014) found
only sustained alpha desynchronization for emotional (vs. neutral)
words during 500-1000 ms after word onsets in a color detection task.
The authors argued that the decreased alpha for the emotional words
indicated sustained attention towards the emotional content, while the
increased alpha indicated released attention after the initial semantic
analysis. Our interpretation of the inconsistent theta results is that these
studies used words with different arousal ratings and different tasks.
After converting the arousal scores from these studies to a 9-point scale,
we found that arousal values for emotional words in the studies without
a theta activity were lower than those with a (trend of) theta activity (e.
g., no arousal ratings in Hirata et al., 2007, 5.42-5.56 in Wang & Bas
tiaansen, 2014, and 6.45 in Sulpizio et al., 2020). Additionally, tasks
that require retrieving semantic/emotional features in words (e.g.,
valence judgment tasks) may capture more attention than those that do
not probe semantic/emotional contents (e.g., silent reading and color
detection tasks), thus leading to the change in theta oscillations.
Overall, despite the mixed findings in the EEG TFR research, an
emergent pattern is that theta oscillations are sensitive to the emotional
content of single words, and that they occur in tasks that tap into lan
guage processing. Alpha oscillations are more related to general atten
tion towards emotional contents.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Fifty-six younger (33 females, mean age  SD = 18.64  1.02 years,
range = 18-24 years) and 45 older (25 females, mean age  SD = 67.36
 4.4 years, range = 60-75 years) adults participated in the experiment.
The full characteristics of the participants are available in Table 1. The
younger participants were undergraduate students recruited from the
psychology subject pool and received course credits. The older adults
were recruited on the university campus, senior community centers, and
via online/newspaper advertisements, and received $20. All the par
ticipants were right-handed, native English speakers, with normal or
corrected-to-normal vision. None had neurological disorders, psychiat
ric illness, and were on psychoactive medications likely to modulate
emotional processes (e.g., anti-depressants), based on self-report. All
gave informed consents in accordance with the local ethics committee

1.4. The present study
The current study investigated whether age affects the incremental
processing of emotional words, by taking both the valence and arousal
dimensions of emotion into consideration. We focused on older adults
between 60 and 75 years of age, as a previous cross-sectional study
suggested that negative emotions level off at around the age of 60
(Stacey & Gatz, 1991). Participants performed a lexical decision task
(LDT). We chose to use the LDT, because a word/nonword decision can

(Warriner et al., 2013). In this norm, subjective ratings of valence and
arousal are measured with 9-point Likert scales (1 = unhappy to 9 =
happy; 1 = calm to 9 = aroused). On average, positive words scored
higher on valence ratings than neutral words, followed by negative
words (all p values < 0.001). There is no valence differences for HP vs.
LP words (p = .988), nor for HN vs. LN words (p = .752). For arousal
ratings, HP words were rated with higher scores than LP words, and so is
the case for negative words (all p values < 0.001). No arousal differences
between HP and HN words, nor between LP and LN words were found
(all p values > 0.9). The neutral words had the same level of arousal as
other low-arousing valenced words (both p values > 0.1). To avoid age
differences in the ratings, valence and arousal ratings were carefully
matched in each condition between younger and older adults (all p
values > 0.09), based on the same norms.
Word concreteness (F(4, 175) = 0.697, p = .595), imageability (F(4,
175) = 1.633, p = .168), and familiarity (F(4, 175) = 1.421, p = .229)
were matched across the five word types, based on the Glasgow norms
(Scott et al., 2018). Seven-point Likert type scales were used for the
ratings of concreteness (1 = very abstract to 7 = very concrete), image
ability (1 = very unimageable to 7 = very imageable), and familiarity (1 =
very unfamiliar to 7 = very familiar). Other word properties including
word length (F(4, 175) = 1.653, p = .163), word frequency (in log) (F(4,
175) = 1.897, p = .113), orthographic neighborhood sizes (F(4 175) =
1.16, p = .33), and numbers of phonemes (F(4, 175) = 1.726, p = .146)
and syllables (F(4, 175) = 1.078, p = .369) were also matched, based on
the SUBTLEX-US corpus (Brysbaert et al., 2012) and the English Lexicon
Project database (Balota et al., 2007).
An additional 180 pseudowords (e.g., thack) were selected from the
ARC non-word database (Rastle et al., 2002), with the length ranging
between 4 and 9 letters. Pseudowords are non-existent words following
the orthographic and phonological rules in English. The length in letters
of pseudowords and words was matched (t(320.35) = 1.257, p = .21).
All the 360 words and pseudowords were divided into four lists. Each list
consists of 45 words (9 words for each word type) and 45 pseudowords.
The stimulus order in each list was pseudo-randomized such that no
more than three consecutive trials came from the same word type. The
list order was counterbalanced with participants' number.

prior to participation.
Participants' current mood was measured by the Beck Depression
Index - second edition (Beck et al., 1996). The BDI-II measures levels of
depression with 21 questions, each of the questions answered on a 4point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The
total BDI-II score of our participants ranges from 0 to 26. Three younger
and one older participants were excluded due to a total BDI-II score >
14, the cutoff score for borderline depression. The remaining partici
pants in both the age groups were non-depressed. In addition, each
participant had a minimum score of 27 on the Mini-Mental State Ex
amination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975), which indicated no cognitive
impairment. They also completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Task
(DSST) (Wechsler, 1997) as a general assessment of cognitive functions
such as motor speed, attention, visuoperceptual functions, working
memory, and executive functions (Jaeger, 2018).
Two younger and 6 older participants were excluded due to their low
task performance (i.e., accuracy < 50% in any condition). Thirteen
younger and 3 older adults were excluded due to insufficient trials
(<50%) after artifact rejection of the EEG data. Three younger adults
were also excluded due to equipment errors. The characteristics of the
remaining participants are summarized in Table 1A.

2.3. Procedure
Participants first completed a questionnaire about their language use
and health condition. An elastic cap mounted with 64-channel Ag/AgCl

capping procedure, the participant was taken to a sound-proofed booth
and seated at a desk facing a computer screen 80-100 cm in front of
them. The stimuli were presented visually in a white font (Font: Courier

the issue that short epochs could be contaminated by edge artifacts, the
epoched EEG data from each trial and electrode were reversed and
concatenated to both ends of the trial, making the epoch three times as
long (Cohen, 2014). Trials contaminated with artifacts were corrected
with the same ICA procedure, and rejected with the same standard as in
the ERP analysis (section 2.5). The number of trials included in the
time-frequency analysis for each participant was the same as those in
the ERP analyses, but not the identical epochs after pre-processing.
The time-frequency representations (TFRs) of power were computed
using the Matlab toolbox Fieldtrip (Oostenveld et al., 2011). Each TFR of
the single trial EEG data was constructed by using a 5-cycle complex
Morlet wavelet for frequencies logarithmically-spaced from 2 to 30 Hz in
25 steps. The wavelet was applied to single trials with a duration
equivalent to - 2.9 s before to 3.7 s after the word onset due to the re
flected data on either end. The result was downsampled to yield a value
every 10 ms. After acquiring the TFR of single trials, the power estimates
over single trials were averaged for each word type respectively and
across the participants. The resulting subject-averaged power changes
for the neutral words were subtracted from those for the other four word
types respectively, so as to elucidate power changes related to emotional
word processing (without contamination of motor responses). The
power changes were calculated with the 200 ms pre-stimulus baseline
interval, and expressed in plots with dB scaling after discarding the re
flected portion of the data.

central fixation cross for 500 ms, followed by a blank screen for 200 ms.
Then, a target stimulus appeared and remained on the screen with a
length-dependent duration between 260 and 420 ms. Participants were
instructed to read the word carefully and silently. A question mark then
came up at the center of the screen after a 500-ms blank. When cued by
the question mark, participants needed to decide whether the stimulus is
a meaningful word as accurately as possible, by pressing the YES or NO
button on a response box. The button configuration (left or right) was
counterbalanced across participants. After the response, a "blink or
continue" screen would appear following a 300-ms blank so that par
ticipants could rest their eyes or take a quick break in a self-paced way.
Before the formal experiment, participants did eight practice trials to
familiarize themselves with the procedure. The session of the experi
ment were divided into four blocks, with a short break between blocks.
Each block lasted for 6-7 min, and the entire EEG session lasted for
about 30 min.

2.7. Statistical analysis
For the behavioral data, the mean accuracy of words and controls
(pseudowords) were entered into a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA
with the factors of Lexicality (word, pseudoword) and Age (younger,
older). To examine differences across experimental conditions, we
conducted a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors of 5
Word Type (HN, LN, HP, LP, neutral) and 2 Age (younger, older). The
reaction times were not analyzed, because a delayed response of the
lexical decision was adopted to avoid motor artifacts caused by button
pressing.
Mean ERP amplitudes were exported from 300 to 450 ms, 500-700
ms, and 700-900 ms post-stimulus based on the above-mentioned
literature as well as visual inspection. A three-way mixed-design
ANOVA of 5 Word type (HN, LN, HP, LP, neutral) x 3 Anteriority
(frontal, central, parietal) x 2 Age (young, old) was conducted in each
time window. Guided by visual inspection of the ERP waveforms and
past literature on emotion processing and regulation (Cuthbert, Schupp,
Bradley, Birbaumer, & Lang, 2000; Hajcak, MacNamara, & Olvet, 2010;
Moser et al., 2014), mean ERP amplitudes were averaged over three
electrodes from each of the three regions of interest: frontal (F1, Fz, F2),
central (C1, Cz, C2), and parietal (P1, Pz, P2) sites. When the sphericity
assumption was violated, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was
applied. The alpha levels were set as 0.05 for all statistic tests. To correct
multiple comparisons, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Benjamini &
Hochberg, 1995) was applied by setting a false discovery rate as 0.05.
Only significant main effects or interactions involving Word Type
and/or Age were reported.
For the TFR data, a non-parametric permutation test with the
maximum-statistic based method was used to compare the contrasts of
interest (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). Guided by the visual inspection of
the TFRs, past TFR/ERP studies on (emotional) word processing (Bas
tiaansen & Hagoort, 2006; Citron et al., 2013), and current ERP results,
the TFR data were averaged within the theta band (4-6.5 Hz) and alpha
band (8-12 Hz) in 300-450 ms, 500-700 ms, and 700-900 ms poststimulus time windows, and entered into the permutation test respec
tively. To start with, a simple dependent-samples t-test was performed
on the TF space of interest for each channel data point. A null distri
bution was then created, which assumes no power difference between
the word types. The previous two steps were repeated for 1000 times by
randomly assigning the conditions in subjects, and a t-statistic was

2.4. EEG acquisition
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 64 electrodes
placed on an electrode cap arranged in the 10-10 system (actiCAP, Brain
Products GmBH). The scalp EEGs were recorded with a sampling rate of
500 Hz and referenced to vertex during online recording (actiCHamp,
Brain Products GmBH). A forehead electrode served as the ground. To
avoid impulse artifacts, the online low pass filter was set to 140 Hz and
the high pass filter was set as DC recording. The electrode impedance
was kept below 10 k.
2.5. ERP analysis
EEG recordings were processed offline with the EEGLAB toolbox
(Delorme & Makeig, 2004) and the ERPLAB plugins (Lopez-Calderon &
Luck, 2014) implemented in Matlab (Mathwork Inc.). For the ERP
analysis, the EEG data were first bandpass filtered with frequency values
set as 0.1-30 Hz. Data were re-referenced to the average of both mas
toids (i.e., TP9 and TP10). Then, the continuous EEG data were epoched
by setting the interval as 200 ms before and 1000 ms after the stimulus
onset, using the pre-stimulus interval of - 200 to 0 ms as the baseline
correction. Eye blinks and movements were identified using an inde
pendent component analysis (ICA) with the runica algorithm imple
mented in EEGLAB, and were corrected from the ERP data by visual
inspection of the component time courses. Trials contaminated with
artifacts due to body movements, excessive noises due to fatigue, or peak
deflection exceeding  75 V were rejected. The average trial accep
tance rates were 81.57% for younger adults and 82.73% for older adults.
No difference was found between groups (t(44) = -0.368, p = .72).
Finally, the ERP data were averaged across the younger and older par
ticipants for each word type and pseudowords.
2.6. Time-frequency analysis
A bandpass filter with frequency values set as 0.1-50 Hz was applied
to the raw EEG data. Then, the filtered data were re-referenced to the
average of both mastoids and re-epoched from - 700 before to 1500 ms
after the stimulus onset, with a 200 ms pre-stimulus baseline. To address

computed for each randomization. Finally, the t-statistics of the
observed data were compared to the null distribution, and the propor
tion of t-statistics larger or smaller than the observed ones was calcu
lated. These p-values were thresholded by taking the max statistical
value (i.e., t values) across the TF space of interest on each iteration to
ensure that the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses was
<5%. The permutation tests were conducted by comparing two word
types each time at the first-level. Once the channels that showed a dif
ference between the word types were identified, the subject means were
extracted from these channels (as regions of interest) and time windows
(as time of interest), and further entered into a second-level permutation
test on the two age groups (N = 23 subjects each group), with the par
ticipants' DSST scores included as a control variable (randomization =
1000 times, p < .05, maximum-statistic correction). To explore age
differences on emotional word processing, the permutation tests were
also conducted by contrasting the two age groups for each word type
across each time window and frequency band respectively.
Because there is evidence that cognitive ability in older adults in
fluences their responses to emotional pictures (Foster et al., 2013), we
used a two-step approach to make sure that we could attribute the
observed ERP and TFA results (if there are any) to age, and not to
cognitive ability. First, we selected a subset of participants whose DSST
scores were matched (N = 23 each group). Participants' characteristics
are summarized in Table 1B. Second, we conducted an additional threeway mixed-design ANCOVA of 5 Word type (HN, LN, HP, LP, neutral) x
3 Anteriority (frontal, central, parietal) x 2 Age (young, old) with the
DSST scores included as the covariate, where significant effects or in
teractions involving Word type and/or Age were found.

the words more accurately than younger adults (Older adults: 99.07 
0.94%, Younger adults: 96.97  5.03%). Regardless of age, there was a
trend that all the negative and all the high-arousing words were recog
nized as more accurately than neutral words (HN words: 98.50  3.64%,
LN words: 98.17  4.36%, HP words: 98.54  2.84% vs. Neutral words:
97.72  4.60%; all p values = 0.05-0.075). No Word Type x Age
interaction was found (F(4, 176) = 1.987, p = .098, 2p = 0.043).
3.2. ERP results
The grand averaged ERP waveforms based on 23 subjects each group
with the matched DSST scores between groups are shown in Figs. 3 and
4. In both the groups, there were clear visual N1 and P2 complexes,
indicating normal early visual processing. In younger adults, all five
word types showed prominent deflections starting from 300 ms, iden
tified as N400s, late positive potentials (LPPs), and sustained slow
positivities (SSPs). In older adults, the LN words elicited larger positiv
ities at ~ 500 ms, compared with the other word types.
3.2.1. N400 (300-450 ms)
In the 300-450 ms time window, the results showed a main Age
effect (F(1, 44) = 13.341, p = .001, 2p = 0.233), an Age x Anteriority

interaction (F(2, 88) = 21.333, p < .001, 2p = 0.327), and a trend of
three-way interaction of Word type x Age x Anteriority (F(8, 352) =
2.195, p = .050, 2p = 0.050). Further comparisons revealed that in
younger adults, there was an interaction of Word type x Anteriority (F
(8, 176) = 3.689, p = .006, 2p = 0.144). Younger adults showed a trend
of a larger frontal N400 for neutral than for positive words (p = .053)
and also a trend of a larger frontal N400 for neutral than for negative
words (p = .065), irrespective of word arousal. In older adults, there was
a widespread main effect of Word type (F(4, 88) = 3.620, p = .009, 2p =
0.141): The LP words elicited a larger N400 than the LN words in older
adults (p = .020). A main effect of Word type was also found (F(4, 122)
= 3.122, p = .016, 2p = 0.066). However, the post-hoc comparisons did
not show any significant N400 differences across word types (all p
values > 0.063). After controlling for the DSST scores, the three-way
interaction disappeared (F(8, 344) = 2.093, p = .072), yet the Age ef
fect (F(1, 43) = 12.369, p = .001, 2p = 0.223) and Age x Anteriority

3. Results
3.1. Behavioral results
The accuracy results are summarized in Fig. 2. There was a main
effect of Lexicality (F(1, 44) = 21.99, p < .001, 2p = 0.333). In both older
and younger adults, words were more accurately recognized than
pseudowords (Word: 98.02  3.73%, Pseudoword: 95.15  5.03%).
There was also a main effect of age (F(1, 44) = 9.567, p = .003, 2p =
0.179). The older adults had an overall higher accuracy of lexical de
cisions over the younger adults (Older adults: 98.20  0.97%, Younger
adults: 95.00  4.94%). There was no interaction between Lexicality
and Age (F(1, 44) = 3.502, p = .068, 2p = 0.074).
Word type matters (Fig. 2). There were a main effect of Word Type (F
(4, 176) = 3.397, p = .011, 2p = 0.072) and a marginal effect of Age (F(1,

interaction (F(2, 86) = 22.188, p < .001, 2p = 0.340) remained signif
icant: Older adults had a smaller N400 than younger adults in both the
frontal and central sites (both p values < 0.015). This suggested that the
observed Word type by Age interaction could still be affected by the
residual differences of the DSST performance between the two age
groups in the matched subsets.

for younger adults (left panel) and older adults (right panel).

3.2.2. Late positive potentials (500-700 ms) and sustained slow positivities
(700-900 ms)
To statistically understand if the patterns of results differ between
the 500-700 and 700-900 time windows, we carried out a four-way
mixed-design ANOVA of 2 Time (500-700 ms, 700-900 ms) x 5 Word
type (HN, LN, HP, LP, neutral) x 3 Anteriority (frontal, central, parietal)
x 2 Age (young, old) on the subset of data (N = 23 subjects each group).
We found that time interacted with all variables: Time x Word type x
Anteriority (F(8, 352) = 3.108, p = .016, 2p = 0.066), Time x Word type

Anteriority interaction (F(2, 86) = 26.096, p < .001, 2p = 0.378)
remained significant, but the Word type x Anteriority interaction dis
appeared (F(8, 344) = 0.396, p = .923).
3.3. TFR results
3.3.1. Theta waves (4-6.5 Hz)
Accessing word type effects combined across younger and older
adults, the permutation tests revealed an enhanced theta power only in
the 500-700 ms time window for the LN words compared with the LP
words, at the left frontal sites (p < .05) (Fig. 5).
Based on our a-prior prediction of theta difference between younger
and older adults, we directly compared the groups. There was a stronger
theta decrease in the 700-900 ms time window for younger than older
adults, for the HN and LP words, respectively, at the left temporalparietal sites (p < .05), although the effects may not be robust, span
ning <3 adjacent electrodes (Fig. 5C).

x Age (F(4, 176) = 2.817, p = .032, 2p = 0.060), and Time x Anteriority

x Age (F(2, 88) = 6.273, p = .008, 2p = 0.125). This suggests that the
patterns of results in these two time windows differ.
Focusing on the 500-700 ms time window, we found a main Age
effect (F(1, 44) = 10.097, p = .003, 2p = 0.187) and an Age x Anteriority

interaction (F(2, 88) = 46.603, p < .001, 2p = 0.514). Older adults had a
larger LPP than younger adults in both the frontal (t(44) = -5.568, p <
.001) and central sites (t(44) = -2.332, p = .024), regardless of the word
types. There was also a main effect of Word Type (F(4, 176) = 5.654, p <
.001, 2p = 0.114). Regardless of age, the HN words elicited a larger LPP
than the LP words (p < .01). Additionally, the LN words showed a larger
LPP than all the positive and neutral words (p < .01). After controlling
for the DSST scores, the Age effect (F(1, 43) = 9.477, p = .004, 2p =
0.181) and Age x Anteriority interaction (F(2, 86) = 42.024, p < .001,
2p = 0.494) remained significant, but the effect of Word type dis
appeared (F(4, 172) = 1.810, p = .129).
In the 700-900 ms time window, we found an Age x Anteriority
interaction (F(2, 88) = 27.033, p < .001, 2p = 0.381). Older adults had a
larger SSP than younger adults in the frontal sites (t(44) = -4.216, p <
.001), regardless of the word types. There was also an interaction of
Word type x Anteriority (F(8, 352) = 2.301, p = .050, 2p = 0.050).
Further comparisons showed that the LN words continued to elicit an
SSP compared with the LP words (p = .04), with the effect restricted to
the frontal sites. After controlling for the DSST scores, the Age x

3.3.2. Alpha waves (8-12 Hz)
In the 300-450 ms time window, the permutation tests revealed an
enhanced alpha power for the LN words compared with the LP words at
the left frontal sites, in both the age groups (p < .05) (Fig. 6). The alpha
increase between these two word types was significantly larger for
younger than older adults at the left frontal sites (p < .05) (Fig. 7). In
both the age groups, the alpha power also increased for the HN words
compared with the LP words at the right frontal sites in the same time
window (Fig. 6D).
In direct comparison between the groups, there was a stronger alpha
decrease in the 700-900 ms time window, for younger than older adults,
for the HN and HP words, respectively, at the left temporal-parietal sites
(p < .05) (Fig. 6C).

emotional words with varying valence (positive, negative) and arousal
(high, low) in a visual word recognition paradigm. We found age
affected word processing in both the lexical/semantic retrieval and later
elaboration stage. Consistent with the SAVI model, older adults showed
a positivity bias only when recognizing low-arousing (vs. high-arousing)
words. In the 300-450 ms time window, older adults showed increased
N400s for low-arousing positive (LP) words relative to low-arousing
negative (LN) words, whereas younger adults showed a trend of atten
uated frontal N400s for emotional relative to neutral words. Older adults
also showed a weaker left frontal alpha (8-12 Hz) increase than younger
adults for LN (vs. LP) words. In the 500-700 ms time window, older
adults showed a larger mid-frontal theta increase than younger adults
for LN words. In the 700-900 ms time window, the exploratory analyses
showed a stronger alpha decrease for high-arousing negative (HN) and
high-arousing positive (HP) words in younger than older adults.

4.1. Lexical/semantic retrieval: N400 effects
Our ERP N400 results suggest that older adults prefer positive over
negative information in language, but only when such information is
low-arousing, consistent with the SAVI model (c.f., Introduction). In ERP
research of language, N400 has been associated with the ease of word
retrieval from the semantic memory (Lau et al., 2008). Emotional words
often showed an attenuated N400, compared to neutral words. The
widely accepted interpretation is that emotional content facilitates word
retrieval (Imbir et al., 2016; Ku et al., 2020; Palazova et al., 2011; Recio
et al., 2014; Sass et al., 2010). Our younger adult group showed exactly
this, although with a marginal significance, which may reflect lower
power due to the smaller sample size (N = 23) included in the cognitiveability-matched participants. In older adults, the LP words showed
enhanced N400s relative to the LN words, reflecting the effort to retrieve
more meanings from the LP words. That is, low-arousing positive in
formation can pose more difficulty for older adults during lexical

retrieval, possibly due to their up-regulation for low-arousing positive
information.
In the time-frequency representations (TFRs), younger adults
showed a larger alpha increase in the LN (vs. LP) words in comparison to
older adults (300-450 ms). There are two possible interpretations of
alpha: affective attention and inhibition. Based on the attention account
of alpha, older adults devoted more attentional resources to the LP
words during the word retrieval stage than younger adults, supporting
arousal modulation of the positivity bias effect. Alternatively, the LN
words may elicit (emotionally) conflicting information that is more
difficult to process than words activating non-conflicting information (i.
e., HN words) (Citron et al., 2013). When information of different
valence and arousal is combined in a single word, high arousal facili
tated evaluations of negative words and interfered with evaluations of
positive words, while low arousal interfered with those of negative
words and facilitated those of positive words (Dillon et al., 2006). Ac
cording to the inhibition-timing hypothesis (Klimesch et al., 2007), an

alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) reflects a release of inhi
bition related to cortical activation, whereas an alpha event-related
synchronization (ERS) suggests increased inhibitory control. We thus
argued that the "conflicting" information in our LN words may lead to an
alpha ERS, suggesting an inhibition to the conflicting or irrelevant in
formation in the words. In this regard, the larger alpha increase found
for younger than older adults may indicate older adults' decreased in
hibition to the "conflicting" information in the LN words, possibly due to
their physiological decline. Additionally, both the age groups with
matched DSST scores showed a larger alpha ERS (300-450 ms) in the
HN words than the LP words. Following the account of
approach-withdrawal motivation, our data could suggest that with
drawal information (i.e., HN words) is linked to a suppression of
attention during word retrieval, whereas approaching information (i.e.,
LP words) implies an increased attention in the same stage, after con
trolling for participants' general cognitive ability. Taken together,
negative words, regardless of arousal, generated higher alpha increase in

our study. We speculated that this could support "affective tuning" in
which negative emotions narrow or constrict one's attentional and/or
cognitive scope, leading to increased inhibition of brain processes
(Fredrickson, 2004).
Topographically, the alpha activity in the N400 time frame seemed
prominent at the right frontal/parietal regions in the LN and LP words in
older adults (Fig. 6B), albeit not statistically significant. This scalp dis
tribution is consistent with a recent meta-analysis (Hoffman & Morcom,
2018). They found that older adults showed a reduced activity in the left
hemisphere semantic network, but an increased activity in the right
frontal and parietal regions, during lexical and semantic tasks, sug
gesting a shift from semantic-specific to domain-general neural re
sources in later life.

4.2. Semantic elaboration and sustained attention: LPP and SSP effects
In contrast to our prediction, age did not modulate LPP effects in
emotional words. Irrespective of age, the LPPs were larger for HN than
for LP words, and were larger for LN than for HP, LP, and neutral words.
These findings are in line with the negativity bias effect often seen in
younger adults during emotional word processing (Delaney-Busch et al.,
2016; Kanske & Kotz, 2007; Schacht & Sommer, 2009b) and emotional
sentence processing (Delaney-Busch & Kuperberg, 2013; Fields &
Kuperberg, 2012; Holt et al., 2009). Although we should not interpret
too much about null effects, the lack of age modulation on the emotional
word LPP effect is likely due to our control of DSST scores between the
two age groups. In our matched subsets, older adults have as generally
good cognitive ability as younger adults given the high sensitivity of the
DSST to cognitive deficits (Jaeger, 2018). Foster et al. (2013) found that
10

L.-C. Ku et al.

elaborative processing of negative contents, possibly due to enhanced
motivational salience for withdrawal (relative to approach) information.
For low-arousing words, the larger LPPs in the LN words relative to all
the positive and neutral words further suggested that negative infor
mation, regardless of arousal, attracted elaborative processing. Recent
studies showed that how arousal and valence impact word processing
can depend on task demands. For instance, Bayer et al. (2012) compared
the processing of German emotional nouns in a lexical decision task
(LDT) and a reading task. High-arousing words elicited larger LPP am
plitudes (420-630 ms) than low-arousing words in the LDT rather than
the reading task. In contrast, using the LDT, Citron et al. (2013) did not
find a valence or arousal effect on the LPP (430-650 ms), but a trend of
interaction of valence and arousal on the SSP (650-1000 ms) when
participants read English emotional words of different word categories
(i.e., nouns, adjectives, and verbs). The authors argued that this may
suggest differential processing for straightforward approach-withdrawal
system (LP and HN words in this case) and "conflicting" approachwithdrawal system (HP and LN words). More recently, Delaney-Busch
et al. (2016) found an arousal effect in a semantic categorization task (i.
e. to judge if the word referred to an animal). High-arousing words
elicited larger LPPs (500-800 ms) than low-arousing words. Regardless
of word arousal, LPP amplitudes were larger for unpleasant words than
pleasant words, followed by neutral words in a valence categorization
task. We thus argued that how valence and arousal contribute to the LPP
may depend on task and the emotional dimension that the task is focused
on. In this regard, our data showed that our lexical decision task suc
cessfully directed people's attention toward both the valence and
arousal aspects of words.
We did not find an age difference on the SSP effect (700-900 ms).
Both the age groups elicited a larger SSP for the LN than the LP words.
There are two possible interpretations of the SSP effect: attention vs.
regulation. From the attention account, it is possible that the lowarousing negative information attracted sustained attention for mean
ing resolution than the arousal-matched yet positive information. From
the regulation account, our participants may regulate the negative
emotions only in the low-arousing words, irrespective of age when
cognitive abilities are matched. Past studies have associated increased
late positivity (400-1,000 ms) with more cognitive resources for downregulating negative information in pictures in younger adults (Baur
et al., 2015; Langeslag & Surti, 2017). Partially supporting the SAVI
model, the enhanced SSP may thus reflect increased efforts to downregulate the low-arousing negative (vs. positive) contents in people
with average cognitive abilities. However, due to a lack of explicit
regulation instructions in the current task, one needs to take caution in
interpreting these SSP effects. Future studies are needed to further
distinguish the functional significance between LPP and SSP effects.
In the TFR analyses in the 700-900 ms time window, age differences
were found in the alpha band for the HN and HP words, with a more
robust effect in the HN words. Specifically, younger adults showed a
stronger posterior alpha ERD in the HN (and possibly HP) words than
older adults. This is consistent with the past findings that (high)
emotionally arousing information led to an alpha decrease in younger
adults, in a late time window (~600-1000 ms) across different tasks,
such as the passive viewing and categorization tasks (Schubring &
Schupp, 2019), and the color detection task (Wang & Bastiaansen,
2014). It is likely that high arousing information (1) attracts more sus
tained attention, or (2) reflects greater cortical inhibition due to emotion
regulation, than low-arousing information in younger adults, but not
that much in older adults due to physiological decline.
In terms of topographical differences, older adults showed a frontal
distribution of late/sustained positivity, consistent with the PASA model
where a posterior-anterior shift in the brain takes place as a person ages
(Davis et al., 2007). For instance, it is found that the P300 effect shifts
from posterior to anterior regions in older adults. This reflects their need
to maintain a top-down control to achieve the same task performance
compared with younger adults (O'Connell et al., 2012). In support of

age differences on emotional processing are mainly driven by cognitive
abilities including cognitive control: Cognitive functioning performance
was positively correlated with posterior LPP amplitudes (450-650 ms)
for negative pictures. The authors argued that people with higher
cognitive abilities are more likely to devote more neural resources to
negative pictures, as reflected by the enhanced LPP. They may also be
better in regulating negative emotions, possibly as reflected by an
attenuated LPP in a later time window which was not analyzed in their
study. In contrast, people with lower cognitive abilities may have dif
ficulty processing negative pictures, attenuating both the earlier and
later LPP effects. This highlights the mediating role of cognitive abilities
rather than age per se in explaining variances in our late ERP effects.
In the TFRs in the same LPP time window, the LN words showed a
larger left frontal theta increase than the LP words. Theta activity in the
fronto-temporal regions has been associated with the retrieval of lexicalsemantic information, albeit in an earlier time window (i.e., 300-500
ms, Bastiaansen & Hagoort, 2006; Bastiaansen et al., 2005). This means
that low-arousing and negative information in LN words together may
lead to elaborative meaning processing as compared to low-arousing
positive information in LP words. It is possible that our younger and
older adults re-evaluated negative meanings, especially with low
arousal, following a suppression of attention to either (1) the word as a
whole, or (2) the conflicting information in the word, in the N400 time
window. An alternative interpretation for the enhanced theta is an
emotion regulation account. For instance, Ertl et al. (2013) found an
enhanced mid-frontal theta power (4-5 Hz) during cognitive reappraisal
of negative emotions in pictures with the sources localized to the left
middle/inferior frontal gyrus. This indicated that both the age groups in
our study made similar efforts in down-regulating low-arousing negative
emotions than they did with high-arousing ones. However, a closer look
at the topography of theta activity across different word types and age
groups (Fig. 5) indicated that older adults showed a larger mid-frontal
theta increase for the LN rather than the LP words compared with
younger adults. This is confirmed by a planned comparison of the midfrontal theta (i.e., the averaged power of AFz, Fz, and FCz channels) with
permutation tests on both the age groups for each word type in the same
LPP time window (p < .05). We thus postulated that mildly negative
emotions can be down-regulated via top-down processes in healthy el
ders, possibly via meaning elaboration. This partially supports the SAVI
model, and a "weak" version of the positivity bias effect.
Regarding the word type effect on LPPs, our data further showed that
the negativity bias effect depends on word arousal. For high-arousing
words, the larger LPPs for the HN relative to LP words indicated
11

this, our data showed that older adults had actually higher accuracy
rates of lexical decisions for all the word types (including the pseudo
words) than younger adults. Previous studies found that the P300 effect
reflected decision making and context-updating in stimulus processing,
often with the oddball paradigm (van Dinteren et al., 2014). We ob
tained similar distributions of the late positivities in our study, with a
different task that particularly taps into emotional word processing. In
this regard, older adults may use more cognitive resources as a
compensatory mechanism to achieve a better task performance than
younger adults during visual word recognition. However, these topo
graphical differences should be interpreted carefully due to the poor
spatial resolution of the scalp EEG.

4.3. Limitations and future directions
There are a number of limitations and future directions. First,
although we only included minimally-depressive participants into the
analyses based on the BDI-II scores, younger adults still showed a
slightly higher BDI-II score than older adults. This means that older
adults generally felt slightly more positive than younger adults did when
they filled out the questionnaire two weeks before the EEG experiment.
It is thus possible that the positivity bias we found in older adults may be
due to their recent positive affect, rather than a long-term trait affect.
Second, later ERP effects in general are more likely to be affected by task
demands. We chose to use the LDT, because it does not require explicit
evaluation or elaborative processing. Future studies can use tasks that
require some elaborative processing, yet are not too demanding, such as
a semantic relatedness task. Third, although we strictly matched the
orthographic and lexical/semantic properties of our word stimuli, it still
remains unclear at which level of word processing (e.g., orthographic or
lexical/semantic) the age-related positivity bias occurs. Future studies
can manipulate each of these variables, e.g., word frequency, to pinpoint
the processing level in which the age-related positivity bias occurs.
Finally, our data on the N400 effect showed that the age differences
across word types could partly be explained by the DSST performance,
even though the DSST scores were carefully matched between the two
age groups. Future studies should further examine how cognitive ability
affects the age-related positivity bias.
5. Conclusions
In the current study, we examined how age affects positivity bias in
language, and whether that depends on emotional arousal of words. Our
data supported the SAVI model in that older adults attend to lowarousing positive meanings initially, yet elaborate low-arousing nega
tive meanings more at the later stages of word processing. In contrast,
younger adults attend to and elaborate negative and high-arousing
meanings more at the later stages. The present study indicates that
future studies on emotional word processing should take age differences
into account. In addition, although emotional words are generally
considered as less arousing than emotional pictures, we found the evi
dence that it may be difficult for older adults to regulate meanings in
high-arousing (vs. low-arousing) words. More importantly, given that
the same word may elicit different emotional experiences across older
adults, our data suggest that older adults' positivity bias may be a
ubiquitous phenomenon, despite their various life experiences and/or
frequency of exposure.
