The ability of 20 adult dyslexic readers to extract frequency information from
successive tone pairs was compared with that of IQ-matched controls using
temporal order discrimination and auditory backward recognition masking
(ABRM) tasks. In both paradigms, the interstimulus interval (ISI) between tones in
a pair was either short (20 ms) or long (200 ms). Temporal order discrimination
was better for both groups of listeners at long than at short ISIs, but no group
differences in performance were observed at either ISI. Performance on the ABRM
task was also better at long than at short ISIs and was influenced by variability in
masker frequency and by the spectral proximity of target and masker. The only
significant group difference was found in one condition of the ABRM task when
the target-masker interval was 200 ms, but this difference was not reliable when
the measure was of optimal performance. Moderate correlations were observed
between auditory thresholds and phonological skill for the sample as a whole and
within the dyslexic and control groups. However, although a small subgroup of
dyslexic listeners with poor phonology was characterized by elevated thresholds
across the auditory tasks, evidence for an association between auditory and
phonological processing skills was weakened by the finding of a subgroup of
control listeners with poor auditory processing and normal phonological processing skills.

n recent years, there has been renewed interest in the possibility
that a fundamental perceptual limitation in the auditory domain compromises phonological representations that are critical to oral and
written language development (Tallal, Allard, Miller, & Curtiss, 1997).
This proposal followed from a series of experiments, conducted by Tallal
and colleagues with children with specific language impairment (SLI),
that made extensive use of an auditory repetition task. In this task,
children were first taught to label differentially a pair of complex tones
differing in fundamental frequency. Next, children were presented with
sequences of the tones and had to indicate the order in which the tones
had been presented. In the test phase, the interstimulus interval (ISI)
for the tone pairs was varied from short to long durations.
Performance on this temporal order task was impaired for children
in the SLI group when the ISI was relatively short (below 150 ms; Tallal

& Piercy, 1973a) and also when tones were short (75
ms) rather than long (250 ms) in duration (Tallal &
Piercy, 1973b). Furthermore, the groups did not differ
on a visual version of the task. The results were taken
to indicate a deficit, specific to the auditory domain, in
processing brief, rapidly presented auditory signals
among children with SLI.1 Similar findings were reported for a group of 20 children with reading disability,
who were also given a discrimination and a repetition
version of the auditory task, using mixed presentation
of pairs of stimuli at different ISIs (Tallal, 1980). It is
important to note that only 40% (8 out of 20) of the poor
readers showed a clear deficit on the repetition task.
Attempts to replicate Tallal's (1980) finding of rapid
auditory processing deficits in samples of dyslexic children and adults have been equivocal (e.g., Heath, Hogben,
& Clark, 1999). In line with Tallal, Reed (1989) demonstrated group differences in performance on the repetition task for short (10 ms), but not for long (400 ms)
ISIs (cf. Cacace, McFarland, Ouimet, Schrieber, & Marro,
2000). Further studies have reported weaker levels of
performance on the auditory repetition task for groups
of dyslexic children, for both long and short ISIs
(Marshall, Snowling, & Bailey, 2001; Nittrouer, 1999;
Reed, 1989; Waber et al., 2001).
A second experimental procedure used to investigate processing of rapidly presented auditory signals has
involved auditory backward recognition masking (ABRM;
McArthur & Hogben, 2001). In this task individuals are
required to discriminate and identify intensity or pitch
differences between suprathreshold test signals that are
followed by an auditory mask (Kallman & Massaro,
1979; Massaro, 1972; Massaro & Burke, 1991); recognition masking differs from energetic masking, which is
manifest typically as elevated thresholds for signal detection. The effect of the masker on test recognition is
greatest when the ISI between test and masker stimuli
is relatively short (250 ms) and is reduced at longer ISIs
because more time is available for perceptual processing of the signal before the arrival of the masker. This
task can therefore be considered an index of rapid auditory perceptual processing on the assumption that more
rapid processing of the signal will reduce the effects of
the masker.
McArthur and Hogben (2001) used ABRM to examine the ability of reading-disabled children to make intensity discriminations between pairs of tones that were
followed by an auditory mask. Overall, there were no
differences in performance between poor readers and
controls. However, a subgroup of the reading-disabled
children showed elevated thresholds on the ABRM task;

Tallal changed her position in later work (Tallal, 1980; Tallal et al.,
1997), arguing for temporal order deficit; see Studdert-Kennedy and
Mody (1995) for a discussion regarding the term temporal processing.

these poor readers tended to show concomitant oral language difficulties (cf. Heath et al., 1999). It should be
noted, however, that at least some of the individuals with
oral language difficulties in the study had ABRM thresholds within the normal range.
The question of what underlies deficits in performance on tests of rapid auditory processing remains unresolved. The finding that individuals with reading difficulties perform within the normal range on tasks
typically taken to measure temporal resolution, such as
the ability to detect a brief silent interval in ongoing
noise (McAnally & Stein, 1996; Schulte-Korne, Deimel,
Bartling, & Remschmidt, 1998), suggests that the impairment does not involve simply poor temporal resolution.
Several recent studies have reported that dyslexic
listeners show deficits on tests tapping the discrimination of basic acoustic dimensions, including frequency
discrimination, detection of frequency modulated tones,
and binaural release from masking (Hari, Saaskilahti,
Helenius, & Uutela, 1999; McAnally & Stein 1996). In a
similar vein, Baldeweg, Richardson, and Gruzelier
(1999) measured electroencephalic responses in groups
of dyslexic and normal reading adults. They reported
abnormal mismatch negativity in the dyslexia group in
response to changes in tone frequency (but not to changes
in tone duration) when performing a visual distractor
task. In contrast, Hill, Bailey, Griffiths, and Snowling
(1999) found no significant differences between adults
with dyslexia and normal reading adults (matched for
age and IQ) in mean frequency difference thresholds that
were measured at relatively low (1 kHz) or high (6 kHz)
frequencies. However, a subgroup of dyslexic listeners
was noted to have high thresholds outside the range of
performance for the control group at both frequencies.
Conflicting findings have also been reported for samples
of adults with dyslexia given tasks involving detection
of frequency modulation (FM; Hill et al., 1999; Witton
et al., 1998).
A plausible reason for at least some of the conflicting findings in studies investigating low-level auditory
processes in dyslexia is that the dyslexic samples are
drawn from different populations and may differ in severity. It is widely acknowledged that there are individual differences in dyslexic children's reading (Castles
& Coltheart, 1993) and related variations in the severity of their phonological processing deficits (Griffiths &
Snowling, 2002). Indeed, according to Tallal (1980), only
those individuals demonstrating more severe phonological processing impairments would be expected to demonstrate deficits in rapid auditory processing.
In line with this view, correlations of moderate size
have been reported for poor and normal readers between
nonword reading (i.e., phonological decoding skill) and
FM detection thresholds (Witton et al., 1998) and between

nonword reading and performance on an auditory temporal order judgment task (Heath et al., 1999). McAnally,
Castles, and Stuart (2000) concluded that frequency
discrimination skill is associated specifically with
nonword rather than word reading skill. Correlations
between auditory performance and nonword reading
have also been reported in unselected samples of normal readers, after controlling for the effects of age and
IQ (Ahissar, Protopapas, Reid, & Merzenich, 2000; Au
& Lovegrove, 2001; Talcott et al., 1999). However,
Bishop, Carlyon, Deeks, and Bishop (1999) failed to find
a significant correlation between nonword reading and
auditory processing performance in a sample of children with SLI.
A more stringent test of the strength of the association between auditory processing and phonological processing skill is provided by its relation with measures of
oral phonological processing rather than nonword reading. Marshall et al. (2001) reported a significant partial
correlation after controlling for age and nonverbal ability between performance on the auditory repetition task
and scores on tests of phoneme deletion, rhyme oddity,
and nonword repetition for a group of dyslexic and normal readers. However, the relatively small samples of
participants in these studies indicate a need for caution
when interpreting significant correlations between auditory and phonological skills.
The present article was concerned principally with
the hypothesis that people with dyslexia have a deficit
that impairs their ability to process auditory stimuli
presented in rapid succession (e.g., Tallal, 1980). A secondary objective was to examine whether our previous
finding of unimpaired pure-tone frequency discrimination in adults with dyslexia (Hill et al., 1999) could be
replicated using a larger sample and tones of much
shorter duration. In line with Hill et al., our sample of
adults with dyslexia consisted of high-functioning individuals selected from the student population. Although
such samples of adults with dyslexia are not representative of the dyslexia population at large, our aim was to
reduce the likelihood of introducing the unwanted confound of another comorbid disorder (e.g., SLI or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]; cf. McArthur,
Hogben, Edwards, Heath, & Mengler, 2001; Ramus et
al., 2003).
In two experiments, we assessed the performance
of dyslexic and normally reading adults on tasks involving "oddity" judgements about sequences of auditory
stimuli presented at slow (200-ms ISI) and fast (20-ms
ISI) rates of presentation. The aim was to extend the
kinds of methods that have been used with children to
adults. In each case, evidence was also sought for a relation between auditory processing and phonological
processing skills. The first experiment used a temporal

1354

order discrimination (TOD) procedure in which listeners were presented with a sequence of four pairs of brief
tones. There was a frequency difference (F) between
the two tones in each pair that was manipulated during
the experiment. In three of the pairs within the sequence,
the standard within-pair tone order was low-high, and
in the target pair the order was high-low. The hypothesis that dyslexic listeners have an impairment in auditory processing of rapidly presented auditory events
predicts that any differences between the dyslexic listeners and the normal-reading control listeners in the
observed threshold should be greater in the short than
in the long ISI condition.
The second experiment used an ABRM procedure
to examine the degree to which dyslexic and control listeners could extract frequency information from the leading tone of a pair of brief tones. Listeners were required
to detect the "odd-one-out" from a sequence of four test
tones. Three of the four tones were at a standard frequency (1 kHz) and the target tone was at a higher
frequency (by F Hz). In a baseline condition there was
no masking tone. In the other conditions in the experiment, each test tone was followed by a masking tone
that was irrelevant to the task. There were two independent variables: (a) the duration of the interval between the test and masker tones (20 ms or 200 ms) and
(b) the frequency of the masking tone. The latter variable was fixed at the standard frequency, selected randomly from a range around the standard frequency, or
selected randomly from a range an octave above the standard frequency.
On the basis of our previous results (Hill et al.,
1999), we did not expect to find differences between
dyslexic and control listeners on the frequency discrimination baseline condition, although, as noted above,
some other studies have reported elevated frequency
difference thresholds for dyslexic listeners. In the
masker conditions, a masking tone would be expected
to have an effect on the dependent variable provided
that it (a) interferes with perceptual processing of a test
tone and (b) arrives before the listener has extracted
sufficient perceptual information for the task from the
auditory representation of the test tone. Because these
prerequisites should be met in masking conditions when
test and masking tones are separated by the short ISI
(Massaro, 1970; Sparks, 1976), it was predicted that
recognition of the test tone frequency should be adversely affected in the short ISI condition relative to
the long ISI condition. Furthermore, if dyslexic listeners are impaired in their ability to process rapidly presented auditory events then they should be more susceptible to the effects of the masker. This susceptibility
should be greater at the short ISI and should manifest
as greater threshold elevation (larger F relative to

the no-masker baseline condition) for dyslexic listeners
than for control listeners.2
Different patterns of data may be expected for the
different masker conditions. In the fixed-frequency
masker condition (which has some similarities to the
same-different discrimination test used by Tallal,
1980), masking effects may be at least partially offset
by strategic use of within-pair test-masker comparisons to facilitate identification of the interval containing the target tone. When the frequency of the masker
tone is varied randomly around the standard tone frequency--the 1-kHz random-frequency masker condition--the potential benefits of strategic test-masker
comparisons are eliminated. Instead, there is now a
potential cost associated with the risk of confusing test
and masking tones. The risk of this confusion is reduced when the masker frequency varies randomly
around 2 kHz. These considerations predict magnitudes
of masking effects in the following order: fixed-frequency masker < 2-kHz random-frequency masker <
1-kHz random-frequency masker.
There are also grounds for expecting a difference in
performance between dyslexic and control listeners across
the two random-frequency masker conditions. Rosen and
Manganari (2001) reported that people with dyslexia had
higher detection thresholds than control listeners in a
backward-masking task when the masker was a bandpass
noise centered on the signal frequency. However, there
was no significant difference in threshold when the
masker energy was spectrally remote from the signal.
Although the reason underlying the poorer performance
of the people with dyslexia in the on-frequency masker

condition is unclear, this result provides some basis for
predicting that the relative performance of dyslexic listeners will be poorer when the random frequency masker
is varied around 1 kHz. The same prediction is suggested
by Helenius, Uutela, and Hari's (1999) report that adults
with dyslexia were more likely than control listeners to
segregate a sequence of different-frequency tones into
separate perceptual streams.
Thus, in all masker conditions for which the duration of the interval between test and masking tones is
short, the hypothesis that people with dyslexia are impaired in processing rapidly occurring auditory events
predicts poorer performance (manifest as elevated thresholds) for dyslexic listeners compared to control listeners.

Method
Participants
Twenty adults with dyslexia (8 men, 12 women),
sampled from the student population at the University
of York, participated in the study; all had a documented
history of reading and spelling difficulties. Participants
came from different academic departments and were
studying a variety of subjects. The control group of 20
participants (8 men, 12 women) was also selected from
a range of academic departments and subject disciplines
and had no known history of difficulties with literacy
acquisition. All participants had audiometric pure-tone
thresholds not exceeding 20 dB HL in the range of 250-
8000 Hz.

and the control readers ranged from 18.5 to 28.8 years
and from 18.5 to 36.9 years, respectively. Matching for
IQ was on the basis of the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-
Revised (WAIS-R; Wechsler, 1994). The two groups did
not differ in age or IQ: F(1, 38) = 2.9, ns, for Vocabulary; F < 1 for Block Design.
Attainments in reading and spelling accuracy were
obtained from all participants by administration of the
Wide Range Achievement Test-Third Edition (WRATIII; Jastak & Wilkinson, 1993). The reading attainments
of the dyslexia group were age-appropriate; however,
given their relatively high level of intelligence, their
reading level was below expectation (see Table 1). Reading and spelling raw scores for the dyslexia group were
poorer statistically than those of the control group: F(1,
38) = 14.0, p < .001, for reading; F(1, 38) = 40.7, p < .001,
for spelling.

Literacy and Phonological
Processing Measures
Additional measures of reading and phonological
skill were administered to all participants to confirm
group status (Hatcher, Snowling, & Griffiths, 2002).

Test of Word Reading Efficiency
(TOWRE)
The TOWRE (Torgeson et al., 1999) was used to
measure reading rate and accuracy. Participants were
shown a list of either words or nonwords and instructed
to read aloud as many items as possible within 45 s.

Nonsense Passage Reading
Nonsense passage reading was chosen to assess
decoding skill. Each participant read two passages
taken from Finucci et al. (1976, cited in Gross-Glenn,
Jallad, Novoa, Helgren-Lempesis, & Lubs, 1990). The
first passage contained 17 nonwords embedded in a
context of 52 words (e.g., "Once upon a time a tawndy
rapsig named Gub found a tix of pertollic asquees.").
The second passage contained 13 nonwords embedded
in a context of 44 words. Reading time and accuracy
were recorded.

Spoonerisms
This task assessed participants' abilities to segment
and manipulate phonemes by asking them to exchange
the beginning sounds of two words. The words were
the first and last names of famous individuals. Following training and practice items, 12 test items were administered; accuracy and response time measures were
recorded.
1356

Rapid Naming
Rapid automatized naming (RAN) was assessed using two tasks from the Phonological Assessment Battery (Frederickson, Frith, & Reason, 1997): Digit Naming and Object Naming. Participants were required to
name, respectively, 50 digits and 50 pictures of five objects presented on two cards in random order. Performance was recorded as the time taken to name the items,
to the nearest second.

Verbal Short-Term Memory
The Digit-Span subtest from the WAIS-R (Wechsler,
1994) was used to assess short-term memory, administered according to the test manual.

Auditory Tasks
Stimuli and Equipment
The stimuli were pure tones having a total duration of 75 ms, including 5-ms linear onset and offset
ramps. All tones were presented at a level of 65 dB SPL.
Stimulus waveforms were computed in software using
24-bit amplitude quantization and a sampling frequency
of 44.1 kHz. The waveforms were converted into voltages by means of a LynxOne 24-bit audio card (Lynx Studio Technology, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). The resulting analog signals were routed to a pair of Sennheiser HD580
headphones situated inside an IAC 1201-A double-walled
sound-attenuating booth. A flat panel LCD monitor inside the booth provided listeners with information about
the status of the experiment. Responses were made via
a standard computer keyboard. The experiments were
controlled using custom software running on an IBMcompatible PC. The level and duration of the tones was
the same for the TOD and ABRM tasks.

Temporal Order Discrimination
(TOD)
Each trial began with the presentation of a visual
alerting stimulus for 400 ms. Listeners then were presented with four pairs of tones 400 ms after the offset of
the alerting stimulus. The time interval between the
onsets of the leading tone in successive pairs was fixed
at 775 ms, while the silent interval between members
of a pair was either 20 or 200 ms. The two conditions
were tested in separate blocks, with order of testing randomized across participants. Three of the tone pairs were
presented with a standard frequency tone leading a tone
of higher frequency, with the remaining target pair having the reverse order. The target pair was always presented in the second or third interval with equal a priori
probability, and the task of the listener was to identify
the interval containing the target. Listeners were given
an unlimited time in which to make a response, after

which they were provided with visual feedback for 400
ms. An interval of 1 s separated the offset of the feedback signal and the start of the next trial.
The standard frequency tone in each pair was fixed
at 1 kHz. The frequency of the other tone was varied
adaptively over a 60-trial run according to a two-down,
one-up rule that converged on the frequency difference
corresponding to 71% correct discrimination (Levitt,
1971). At the beginning of a run, the frequency difference between the two tones in each pair (relative to the
standard frequency of 1 kHz) was 8%. This difference
was adjusted using an initial multiplier of 0.5 (i.e., two
correct responses resulted in a halving of the frequency
difference, whereas an incorrect response resulted in the
difference being doubled). The multiplier was increased
to 0.7 following the first four reversals to improve the
resolution of the procedure near threshold. Errors on
the first trial were discarded and did not count as a reversal. The threshold for a single run was defined as
the geometric mean of the frequency difference at each
reversal after the first four reversals (three if the total
number of reversals was odd). Each listener completed
four runs per condition, and the threshold for each condition was taken as the geometric mean of the four runs.

Auditory Backward Recognition
Masking (ABRM)
Frequency difference limens (DLFs) were estimated
for each listener for test tones presented alone without
a masking tone (the baseline condition). The task was
presented using a four-interval, two-alternative, forcedchoice (oddity) procedure, with the target signal presented
with equal a priori probability in either the second or
third interval. The frequency of the tones in three of the
four intervals was fixed at the 1-kHz standard, and the
frequency of the target tone was adjusted adaptively
using the same parameters as for the TOD task.
In the remaining conditions, DLFs were estimated
for backward-masked tones. On each trial, the test tone
was the leading tone in each pair, followed by a masker
tone that listeners were instructed to ignore. For three
of the four tone pairs, the frequency of the leading tone
was fixed at 1 kHz. For the remaining pair, the leading
(target) tone was higher in frequency. The task of the
listener was to identify the interval in which the leading tone had a frequency greater than 1 kHz, which was
always the second or third interval with equal a priori
probability. On each presentation, the frequency of the
masker tone in each pair was (a) fixed at 1 kHz, (b) roved
in frequency over the range of 1.8-2.2 kHz, or (c) roved
in frequency over the range of 0.9-1.1 kHz. In the latter
two conditions, roved in frequency implies that a new
masker frequency was selected randomly from the specified range for each masker presentation. The three

masker conditions were tested in separate blocks of four
60-trial runs. Listeners were first tested using an ISI of
200 ms (between members of a pair) before being tested
on a condition in which the ISI was 20 ms. The adaptive
procedure used to estimate threshold was the same as
that described above. Again, each listener completed four
runs per condition and the threshold for each condition
was taken as the geometric mean of the four runs.

Procedure
In the first session, participants received the cognitive test battery and were screened for hearing loss using standard pure-tone audiometry. Participants completed the TOD task and baseline ABRM condition in
the same 2-hr session, with a 15-min break between the
two tasks. The remaining ABRM conditions were completed in two separate 2-hr sessions: in the first of these
sessions the ISI was 200 ms (three masker conditions,
in separate blocks), and in the final session the ISI was
20 ms (three masker conditions, in separate blocks). The
three-masker conditions were presented in a fixed order
for each ISI: fixed masker, random-frequency masker centered around 2 kHz, random-frequency masker centered
around 1 kHz. For an individual participant, no more than
one session was completed per day, all four sessions being completed within a maximum period of 1 month.

Results
Reading and Phonological Skills
The performance of the dyslexic and control groups
on the measures of reading and phonological processing skills is summarized in Table 1. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed that the dyslexia group performed significantly less well than the control group
on the reading measures, (6, 28) = 9.8, p < .001, and
on the phonological processing tasks, (8, 35) = 4.32, p
< .001. Univariate tests confirmed significant group differences on each of the reading and phonological measures (p < .01).

and individual thresholds for each listener are shown
in Figure 1. Reported thresholds are expressed as a percentage of the standard frequency. Both groups had
higher thresholds in the 20-ms ISI condition than in the
200-ms ISI condition (standard deviations were similar
for each group). TOD thresholds for the dyslexia group
were slightly higher than those for the control group in
both ISI conditions (20-ms ISI: dyslexia group = 0.86%,
control group = 0.76%; 200-ms ISI: dyslexia group =
0.73%, control group = 0.64%).

Figure 1. Dyslexic and normal readers' performance on the TOD task for interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 200 ms (circles) and 20 ms (diamonds). Thresholds are expressed as a percentage of standard frequency. Individual listener thresholds for each group are shown by the
smaller symbols; the enlarged points for each stimulus condition represent the geometric mean threshold for each group.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using a logarithmic transformation of these data, with group
(dyslexia, control) as a between-subjects factor and ISI
(200 ms, 20 ms) as a within-subjects factor. There was no
main effect of group (F < 1), but there was a significant
main effect of ISI, F(1, 38) = 4.9, p < .05. There was no
significant Group x ISI interaction (F < 1).
Inspection of the individual thresholds in each condition of this experiment revealed some noteworthy patterns of individual variation within the sample. A subgroup of 5 individuals with dyslexia and 4 controls
showed elevated thresholds on this task at both ISIs
relative to the group mean. Thresholds ranged from
1.17% to 4.86% for the adults in the dyslexia subgroup
and from 1.27% to 4.68% for adults in the control subgroup. Otherwise, there was almost complete overlap of
the TOD thresholds between the group with dyslexia
and the control group.

ABRM
The results of the dyslexic and normal reader groups
on the ABRM task are shown in Figure 2. Analyses
were performed using a logarithmic transformation of
these data.

Baseline Condition
The baseline condition yielded an estimate of the
DLF for 1-kHz 75-ms pure tones. Mean DLFs were similar in magnitude for the two groups of listeners (dyslexia
1358

group = 0.42%; control group = 0.52%), but were numerically larger for dyslexic listeners than for the controls, with standard deviations of similar magnitude for
both groups. A one-way ANOVA showed that the DLFs
for the two groups did not differ reliably (F < 1). No outliers were identified in the dyslexia group (using a criterion of 1 SD from the mean), but 1 individual was
identified as an outlier in the control group.

Masker Conditions
To examine the effects of masker type and target-
masker ISI on threshold estimates, we performed a 2 x
2 x 3 mixed-design ANOVA, with group (dyslexia, control) as a between-subjects factor and masker type
(fixed, 2 kHz, 1 kHz) and ISI (200 ms, 20 ms) as withinsubjects factors. The difference between the two groups
did not reach statistical significance, F(1, 38) = 3.6, p =
.06, but there were significant main effects of both
masker type, F(2, 76) = 171.55, p < .001, and ISI, F(1,
38) = 68.1, p < .001. Both groups of listeners had higher
thresholds in the short ISI condition than in the longer
ISI condition. Tests of simple contrasts were used to show
that mean thresholds differed significantly for each of
the following contrasts: fixed < random 2-kHz masker <
random 1-kHz masker.
The Group x ISI interaction was not significant (F
< 1), but the Group x Masker interaction was significant, F(2, 76) = 3.7, p < .05. Tests of simple main effects
indicated that dyslexic listeners had higher thresholds

than controls in the 2-kHz random-masker condition
(group with dyslexia = 3.00%; control group = 1.60%),
but the groups did not differ in the fixed-masker or in
the 1-kHz random-masker conditions. For dyslexic listeners, thresholds in the fixed-masker condition were
reliably lower than those in the two random-masker
conditions, which did not differ (fixed = 0.61%, 2 kHz =
3.00%, 1 kHz = 4.17%). For control listeners, thresholds also were reliably lower in the fixed-masker condition than in the random-masker conditions (fixed =
0.50%, 2 kHz = 1.49%, 1 kHz = 3.36%), and, unlike dyslexic listeners, control listeners' thresholds in the 2-kHz
random-masker conditions were reliably lower than
those in the 1-kHz random-masker condition (p < .001).
Neither the Masker x ISI interaction, F(2, 76) = 2.0,
ns, nor the Group x ISI x Masker interaction (F < 1) was
significant. Thus, the effect of the different masker types
on performance was similar at both short and long ISIs.
We note, however, that thresholds were slightly elevated
for both groups in the fixed-masker condition relative
to the baseline condition for short, F(1, 38) = 2.6, p <
.001, but not long ISIs (F < 1).
When the distribution of scores was examined for
outliers, the same subgroups of individuals in both the
dyslexic and the control group who were identified for
the TOD task were also outliers in some (but not all) of
the masker conditions. A small number of dyslexic (6
out of 20) and control listeners (5 out of 20) who had not

been identified previously as outliers also had elevated
thresholds relative to the rest of the sample in some
(but not all) of the masker conditions.

Optimal Thresholds
For all of the above analyses, thresholds for individual participants had been calculated by averaging
across the thresholds obtained for the four runs in each
condition. Inspection of these thresholds for participants
in both groups revealed considerable within-condition
variation, raising the possibility that threshold estimates
based on an average of the thresholds for individual runs
might have obscured subtle differences in performance
between the two groups of listeners. To assess this possibility, we reanalyzed these data taking as the measure of performance the lowest threshold estimate for
each listener from the four runs in each condition. Mean
performance based on these best thresholds is summarized for both groups of listeners in Table 2.
In an ANOVA based on best thresholds, the main
effect of group was not significant, F(1, 38) = 3.75, p =
.06, although as before there was a tendency for the
dyslexia group to have higher thresholds than normal
readers (group geometric means [collapsed across conditions]: dyslexia = 0.77%, control = 0.52%). Significant
main effects were found for both ISI, F(1, 38) = 57.5, p <
.001, and masker type, F(1.54, 58.3) = 117.71, p < .001.

To reduce the data set before exploring the correlations between the phonological, literacy, and auditory
processing measures, we derived two composite variables. These variables were justified by the intercorrelations among measures.3 The literacy variable consisted of performance on spelling accuracy (WRAT-III),
word and nonword reading fluency (TOWRE word and
nonword tasks), and both error and time measures from
the nonsense passage reading task. Reading accuracy
(WRAT-III) was not included in the composite because
it correlated weakly (often not all) with phonological
processing skill in this sample. The phonological variable consisted of performance on the spoonerisms task
(average word response time), and digit and object naming speed (RAN tasks). Digit Span was not included in
the composite score because it correlated weakly (or not
at all) with the literacy measures.

Relationships Between Auditory,
Phonological, and Reading Skills
To investigate the relation between auditory mean
thresholds and measures of phonological and literacy
performance, we computed correlations between the
reading and phonological processing variables and between these and mean thresholds from the two auditory processing tasks (TOD and ABRM) for the pooled
data from dyslexic and normal readers (see the data
below the diagonal in Table 3). Neither age nor Block
Design correlated with any of the other measures; however, there were moderate correlations between vocabulary and reading and spelling accuracy (r = .5-.7). The
data above the diagonal in Table 3 show the partial
correlations between the literacy and phonology variables after controlling for vocabulary levels in the
sample. Because the pattern of results is essentially
the same below and above the diagonal, all reported

Table 4 summarizes the partial correlation coefficients (controlling for vocabulary) between the literacy,
phonology, and auditory measures for the dyslexia group
(below the diagonal) and for the control group (above
the diagonal). These results must be interpreted with
caution due to the small sample size for each group (n =
20). For dyslexic readers, weak correlations were observed between the phonology variable and thresholds
obtained in the TOD task, but the relation was only statistically significant for the short ISI. The phonology
variable also correlated moderately with thresholds from
the ABRM baseline condition (r = -.5, p < .05). For the
control group, moderate correlations were observed between the phonology variable and both conditions of the
TOD task (20-ms ISI: r = -.5, p < .05; 200-ms ISI: r = -.5,
p < .05), but phonology did not correlate with performance
in the baseline ABRM condition, r(20) = -.18. The phonology variable correlated with thresholds from the random 1-kHz masker (collapsed across ISI; r = -.6, p < .05)
in the control listener group only, but with and in none
of the other masker conditions. Finally, moderate correlations between phonology and literacy were observed
for both groups, with the coefficient for the dyslexia
group (r = .5) being smaller, but not significantly so, than
that for the control group (r = .7) (zobt = -0.6, ns).
The relations between phonology composite scores
(z scores) and estimated log thresholds for TOD and
ABRM tasks (the latter collapsed across ISI) are shown
in Figure 3. These scatterplots reveal that a subgroup
of dyslexic individuals falls in the lower right quadrant
of these plots, with weak phonological and auditory processing ability relative to the rest of the individuals in
the sample. If we adopt a criterion of thresholds more
than 1 SD from the mean, then 3 dyslexic individuals
were consistently classified as outliers on both TOD and
ABRM tasks. However, there was also in each case a
subgroup of control participants who had relatively high

thresholds but good phonological processing ability relative to the sample as a whole (see the upper right quadrant of the plots). Using the same outlier criterion, 4
control participants were classified as outliers across
both tasks.

Discussion
In this study we set out to evaluate the proposal that
phonological processing impairments in dyslexia can be
traced to more basic auditory processing deficits. The
adults with dyslexia who participated in the study showed
poor levels of literacy and phonological processing when
compared to a group of age- and IQ-matched students
without dyslexia. Both groups of adult listeners completed
two tasks examining the rapid auditory processing of sequential stimuli. The first, the TOD task, addressed dyslexic listeners' ability to discriminate the temporal order
of tones differing in pitch at varying rates of presentation. The second, the ABRM task, addressed the dyslexic
listeners' abilities to discriminate tone frequency under
conditions when individual tones were followed by masking tones at short target-masker intervals.
In the TOD task, both groups of listeners found it
more difficult to make temporal order discriminations
of pitch in the 20-ms ISI condition than in the 200-ms
ISI condition. Although mean thresholds for dyslexic
listeners were numerically higher than those for control
listeners in both conditions, thresholds for the two groups
did not differ significantly. Furthermore, although a
subgroup of listeners with elevated thresholds in both
conditions was identified, both dyslexic and control listeners were members of this subgroup. The position
taken by Tallal and colleagues (1997) predicts that individuals with TOD deficits should have the most impaired
levels of phonological processing in the sample. Our
data are not consistent with this position; specifically,

a subgroup of control listeners who showed impaired
levels of performance on the TOD task demonstrated
normal levels of phonological processing skill, and there
were other adults with dyslexia in the sample with severe phonological impairments whose thresholds on the
TOD task fell within the normal range.
An alternative hypothesis, based on the findings of
Heath et al. (1999) and McArthur and Hogben (2001),
predicts that the subgroup of dyslexic individuals with
elevated thresholds would demonstrate concomitant
oral language difficulties. For practical reasons, it was
not possible to administer similar tests to those used
with children in this study. However, the individuals
classified as outliers all obtained either average or
1362

above average vocabulary scores, ruling this out as a
plausible explanation.
Taken together, our findings with adult listeners
contrast with those of studies reporting significant
reader-group differences on TOD tasks in children at
both short and long ISIs (Heath et al., 1999; Marshall
et al., 2001; Nittrouer, 1999; Waber et al., 2001). Moreover, the results provide no support for the hypothesis
that dyslexic readers have a specific deficit in the TOD
of rapidly presented tones at short ISIs (Ahissar et al.,
2000; Cacace et al., 2000; Heath et al., 1999; Reed, 1989;
Tallal, 1980; Tallal & Stark, 1982).
The second experimental task used the ABRM paradigm to assess rapid auditory processing. Specifically,

we used the ABRM paradigm to explore the effects of
manipulating target-masker intervals on frequency
discrimination. As in the TOD task, thresholds for all
listeners were significantly influenced by the duration
of the ISI, with a significant elevation in overall thresholds in the 20-ms ISI condition relative to the 200-ms
ISI condition. However, the nonsignificant interaction
between group and ISI again failed to support the claim
that dyslexic individuals have a specific rapid auditory
processing deficit. The similarity in magnitude of estimates of DLFs for dyslexic and control listeners in the
baseline condition is consistent with our previous results
showing no group differences in frequency discrimination performance for longer duration tones and a different sample of dyslexic and control listeners (Hill et al.,
1999).4 As noted above, these results are inconsistent with
other reports of frequency discrimination deficits in
samples of adults with dyslexia (Baldeweg et al., 1999;
Hari et al., 1999; McAnally & Stein, 1996). It is possible
that procedural differences between studies may have
contributed to the difference in outcome. For example,
we used four-interval trials in our experiments, whereas
McAnally and Stein and Hari et al. used three-interval
and two-interval trials, respectively (cf. France et al.,
2002). We also used a minimal-uncertainty procedure in
which the standard frequency was constant throughout
the experiments, whereas in McAnally and Stein's procedure (but not in that of Hari et al., 1999) there was a
trial-by-trial rove in the standard frequency. Whether and
why these and other procedural differences might have
different consequences for dyslexic and control listeners
will require further experimentation, but the differences
in outcome suggest a role for nonsensory factors in accounting for group differences in this type of experiment.
As expected, frequency discrimination performance
was affected by the addition of a masker for both groups
of listeners, with an elevation in thresholds in the fixedmasker condition relative to those in the baseline
nonmasker condition. There was an overall effect of
masker type, with both masker variability (fixed vs. random) and spectral proximity of target and masker (different or same target-masker frequencies) affecting
performance on this task for both the dyslexic and control listener groups. Threshold elevation relative to the
baseline condition was smallest in the fixed-masker condition, consistent with a potential role for the masker
as an additional cue to the target interval. However, the
slightly greater threshold elevation in the short ISI condition suggests that the fixed masker may also have
exerted a small masking effect working against the benefits afforded by a fixed-frequency referent. Threshold
elevation was greater for random-frequency maskers
4

Note that Hill et al. (1999) used 400-ms tones. Experiment 2 of the
present study used 75-ms tones.

than for fixed maskers, consistent with the lack of a
fixed-frequency referent in the random-masker conditions. Thresholds also were greater for the 1-kHz random-masker condition than for the 2-kHz randommasker condition, as predicted by Sparks (1976; but not
by Bland & Perrot, 1978).
A significant interaction between masker type and
group was observed for the 2-kHz random-frequency
masker condition at 200-ms ISI, but the effect was not
significant for the 20-ms ISI condition. These results
suggest that, relative to control listeners, the frequency
discrimination performance of the dyslexic participants
was more adversely affected by the addition of a random-frequency masker. This pattern of performance was
only observed reliably for mean thresholds when the
target and masker were in different frequency regions,
and was not specific to the short ISI condition. One possible interpretation of this finding is that the dyslexic
listeners were less able to exploit the relative unmasking afforded when target and masker occupied different
frequency regions. Consistent with this interpretation,
post hoc tests revealed that the difference in thresholds
between the two random-masker conditions was significant for the control group, but not for the dyslexia group.
Moreover, the thresholds for the two groups did not differ in the 1-kHz random-masker condition when target
and masker were in the same frequency region. We note
that this result contrasts with Rosen and Manganari's
(2001) finding that backward-masked detection thresholds for dyslexic listeners were significantly higher than
those of controls only when the masker spectrally overlapped the signal. The greater similarity of mean thresholds in the 1-kHz and 2-kHz random-masker conditions
for dyslexic listeners than for control listeners provides
no support for the proposal that dyslexic listeners have
an increased tendency to segregate tones of different
frequency (Helenius et al., 1999). If this had been the
case, then the difference between the 1-kHz and 2-kHz
random-masker conditions should have been larger for
dyslexic listeners than for control listeners.
Nonetheless, the absence of any reliable differences
between dyslexic and control listeners in an analysis
using the lowest of the four threshold estimates in each
condition suggests that the single group difference
should be interpreted cautiously. Inspection of the variance in thresholds across the four runs for individuals
in both groups did not reveal the variability indexed
learning or improvement in performance across runs
(i.e., some individuals produced their "best" thresholds
on the first run, others on the second or third).
When the distributions of frequency discrimination
thresholds were examined, no statistical outliers were
identified in the dyslexia group. This contrasts with
the results reported by Hill et al. (1999), who noted a

small subgroup of dyslexic listeners showing elevated
frequency discrimination thresholds for relatively lowfrequency (1 kHz) and high-frequency (6 kHz) tones. In
the present experiment, 1 outlier was identified in the
control group. This individual was also an outlier in the
TOD task, suggesting that his poor performance could
have been due to poor frequency discrimination. A small
number of listeners from both groups were classified as
outliers in the masker conditions of the ABRM task. The
individuals observed with impairments in the TOD task
also were classified as outliers in the masker conditions
of the ABRM task. In addition, a few listeners who had
not experienced any difficulties on the TOD task had
difficulties in the ABRM task. It is clear, therefore, that
some individuals (both dyslexic and normal readers)
experienced difficulty with these auditory tasks, but it
is not clear that their difficulties indicate a genuine
impairment in auditory processing. An alternative possibility is that, for reasons that might include limitations of memory or attention, some individuals may simply be poor at doing psychoacoustical tasks.

Relation Between Auditory and
Phonological Processing Skills
The findings reported above indicate that, as a group,
the dyslexic listeners did not differ significantly from control listeners on two measures of rapid auditory processing. However, our data appear consistent with Tallal's
(1980) prediction that dyslexic individuals with the most
severe phonological processing deficits are impaired on
measures of rapid auditory processing. Moderate correlations were observed between the phonology and auditory measures using the data from the full sample, and
correlational analyses performed using the separate data
sets for the dyslexic and control groups provided some
evidence for a weak association between phonological
processing skill and performance on the TOD task using a short ISI. There was also an association between
performance on the simple frequency discrimination task
(ABRM-baseline) and phonological processing skill. In
contrast, no evidence was found for an association between an individual's phonological processing skill and
his or her ability to discriminate tone frequency when
target tones were followed by masking tones.
Within the dyslexia group, those individuals whose
performance levels were observed to fall consistently
outside the normal range across the majority of the auditory tasks were also among those with the most severe phonological deficits, indexed by the phonology composite score. However, contrary to the hypothesized
association, there were also participants with dyslexia
who had weak phonological processing skills but relatively good levels of auditory processing abilities. In a

1364

similar vein, a subgroup of individuals from the control sample who were unimpaired in their literacy or
phonological processing skills performed poorly on the
auditory tasks. Such findings add to the accumulating
evidence that auditory deficits are neither necessary
nor sufficient to cause phonological difficulties (Bishop
et al., 1999; Rosen & Manganari, 2001). Furthermore,
the observed associations between auditory processing
and phonological processing skills do not speak to the
direction of causality or to possible mediating factors.
For example, common to both the auditory and phonological processing tasks is the need to allocate auditory
attention.
Recent reviews have considered methodological factors that may explain the contradictory findings in the
literature of studies examining auditory processing deficits in dyslexia (Bailey & Snowling, 2002; Hirsh &
Watson, 1996; McArthur & Bishop, 2001). The focus in
the present study on high-achieving adults with dyslexia may have been a factor in our ability to find group
differences in auditory processing. An aim of this study
was to reduce the likelihood of including individuals with
comorbid deficits such as SLI or ADHD, avoiding the
introduction of an undesirable confound into the study
(Ramus et al., 2003). However, we acknowledge the need
for caution when generalizing these results to the wider
dyslexia population.
In summary, we found no strong evidence in the
present study to indicate that adults with dyslexia are
subject to a rapid auditory processing deficit. Neither
was there evidence for problems with the extraction of
frequency information from sequences of nonverbal auditory tones separated by short ISIs. Moreover, the observation that a subgroup of participants, including
both normal and dyslexic readers, had weak auditory
processing skills weakens the argument for a causal
relationship between auditory processing deficits and
literacy impairments. Two possibilities remain open.
First, auditory deficits may act as moderating variables
(Holmbeck, 1977) and only have an impact on literacy
development (when associated with a primary risk factor, such as genetic risk; Bishop et al., 1999). Second,
auditory processing impairments may affect the creation of phonological representations early on in development (perhaps during the preschool years when
they become segmentally organized). As development
proceeds, auditory deficits may resolve sufficiently to
be no longer detectable.
