This study examines the effects of powerful versus powerless speech styles on employment
interview outcomes, extending and refining research by Wiley and Eskilson. Undergraduate and professional respondents listened to one of eight audiotaped interviews manipulated by speech style, interviewer gender, and interviewee gender and evaluated the interviewees' dynamism, social attractiveness, competence, and employability on Likert-type
scales. Results indicate that a powerful speech style results in positive attributions of competence and employability and that professional respondents evaluated the speech styles
differently than did undergraduates. Implications for the employment interview are discussed, and directions for future research are also identified.

Employment interviews have received a great deal of research
attention, partly because interviews are the initial avenue to employment and commensurate personal independence, security, and success.
A comprehensive review of the employment interview research indicates that many factors are involved in determining the success of the
encounter (Arvey & Campion, 1982; Harris, 1989). Specifically, structured interviews appear to have the highest validity (Campion,
Pursell, & Brown, 1988; Huffcutt & Arthur, 1994; Janz, 1989), especially those using a panel of interviewers (Arvey & Campion, 1982; Lin,
Dobbins, & Farh, 1992). Additional evidence indicates that interviewer
validity is often problematic (Dougherty, Ebert, & Callender, 1986;
Dreher, Ash, & Hancock, 1988; Zedeck, Tziner, & Middlestadt, 1983).

That is, variables such as interviewer mood (Baron, 1987, 1993;
Buckley & Eder, 1988), involvement (Ralston, Redmond, & Pickett,
1993), and confirmatory bias (a tendency for interviewers to seek information that confirms their initial impressions) decrease interviewer
validity (Dipboye, 1982; Dipboye, Fontenelle, & Garner, 1984; Macan &
Dipboye, 1994). Moreover, training does not appear to address this bias
in any meaningful way (Dougherty et al., 1986; Fay & Latham, 1982;
Maurer & Fay, 1988).
Arvey and Campion (1982) and Campion and Campion (1987) concluded that research on the effects of interviewee variables has yielded
inconsistent results. In some studies, interviewee nonverbal components such as interpersonal social attractiveness (Kinicki & Lockwood,
1985), personality traits (Kacmar, Delery, & Ferris, 1992), attire
(Forsythe, Drake, & Cox, 1985), scent (White, 1986), and demographics
(Arvey, Miller, Gould, & Burch, 1987; Gilmore, Beehr, & Love, 1986;
Graves & Powell, 1988) have positive effects, whereas in other studies,
these nonverbal components did not significantly affect interview
outcomes.
Most important for this research, Arvey and Campion (1982) and
Harris (1989) concluded that verbal messages are more important to
interview outcomes than nonverbal ones. For example, several studies
indicate that the quantity of verbal messages contributes more positively to interview outcomes than nonverbal cues (Einhorn, 1981; Parson & Liden, 1984; Rasmussen, 1984). Other research suggests that
the verbal message is even more important than paper credentials
(Ugbah & Evuleocha, 1992). Research focusing on the verbal components of interviews has found that interviewees using nonstandard
dialect are evaluated negatively (S. Adler, 1987; Atkins, 1993) whereas
interviewees using prestigious or standard dialects are generally
believed to be more desirable and competent employees (Hopper & Williams, 1973). In addition, researchers investigating the effects of
disfluency levels found that perception of interviewee status was
related to interviewee disfluency (Bradac, Konsky, & Elliott, 1976;
McCroskey & Mehrely, 1969). That is, disfluency levels of interviewees
increased with the increase in perceived interviewer status. The only
study investigating effects of speech style on employment interviews
concluded that interviewees using a powerful speech style were rated
higher than those using powerless speech styles (Wiley & Eskilson,
1985). A powerful speech style conveys the impression that interviewees have self-control as well as control over others (Gibbons, Busch, &
Bradac, 1991; Hosman & Siltanen, 1994).
Accordingly, much contemporary research on speech style indicates
that it significantly affects impression formation. Specifically, people
attribute favorable characteristics such as dynamism, social attractiveness, superiority, control over self, and control over others to those
using a powerful speech style. These are desirable characteristics for

146

an employee to possess. Because positive impression formation is
essential to a successful interview and relatively few studies have
investigated relevant speech styles effects, there is a need for more
research specifically examining these interrelationships. This article
addresses that need.

BACKGROUND
In their classic study of speech in a courtroom setting, Erickson,
Lind, Johnson, and O'Barr (1978) coined the terms "powerful speech
style" and "powerless speech style" and argued that speech style is
linked to social power and status. Low-status persons generally use a
powerless speech style laced with intensifiers ("so," "very"), hedges ("I
think," "kinda"), hesitations ("uh," "well"), hypercorrect grammar,
questioning forms (use of rising, question intonation in declarative
form), polite forms, and gestures. High-status persons rarely use these
powerless forms and therefore employ what Erickson et al. dubbed the
powerful style.
A review of subsequent powerful and powerless speech style studies
indicates that speech style differences and resultant attributions may
be due to status effects, even though gender differences are often
apparent (Carli, 1990; Hosman & Siltanen, 1994; Mulac & Bradac,
1995). Generally, a powerful speech style is clearer and more persuasive than a powerless speech style (Wiley & Eskilson, 1985), and the
powerless style can be confusing for listeners (Erickson et al., 1978).
Moreover, research suggests that low status persons can increase their
credibility by using a powerful speech style, whereas high status persons can experience the opposite effect by using a powerless style
(Johnson & Vinson, 1987). In general, while the powerful speech style
is the most effective in forming positive impressions, it remains
unclear why powerful and powerless speech styles have these effects.
From a global perspective, much is known about powerful and powerless speech style effects. Moreover, when the various components of
speech style are examined individually, the effects are further revealing. For example, hesitations combined with tags (i.e., questioning
forms or use of rising, question intonation in declarative form) are perceived as powerless and ineffective, frustrating the intention of the
would-be communicator (Bradac & Mulac, 1984), whereas hesitations
combined with hedges, while still perceived as powerless, tend to operate by reducing perceptions of authoritativeness and social attractiveness (Hosman, 1989; Hosman & Wright, 1987). Specifically, low hedges
and hesitations are the most authoritative, while high hedges, regardless of hesitations, are the most negative. Bradac, Mulac, and Thompson (1994) found that hesitations lowered aesthetic quality ratings,

Parton et al. / INTERVIEWS AND SPEECH STYLES

147

while hedges lowered sociointellectual status ratings but raised dynamism ratings. Other evidence suggests that intensifiers may not be
uniformly perceived as powerless and may even have powerful connotations in certain contexts (Bradac & Mulac, 1984; Hosman, 1989;
Hosman & Siltanen, 1994) because they may indicate certainty or control (Hosman & Siltanen, 1994; McMullen & Pasloski, 1992).
With respect to gender influences on speech style, Carli (1990) found
that men and women have different communication styles but that the
use of tags, disclaimers, and hedges may be a function of status rather
than gender. Carli suggested that different norms may have been
established for men and women, affecting speech style perceptions.
When the components of the powerful and powerless speech styles
were examined individually, intensifiers were found to occur more frequently than hedges or hesitations, with women using more intensifiers and men using more hedges (Bradac et al., 1994). Hedges and
intensifiers should therefore not be lumped together under the heading of "women's language" or "powerless" language. If men and women
differ in social power, their language use failed to indicate such differences (Bradac et al., 1994; Mulac & Bradac, 1995).
Women who use a powerful speech style are perceived as more credible and persuasive than those who use a powerless style, although the
negative effects of powerless speech are less dramatic when the listener is a man (Johnson & Vinson, 1987). This may be because powerless speech fits men's stereotypical expectations, whereas other
women perceive the use of a powerless speech style as weak and
unsure (Carli, 1990). Both sexes viewed a woman using powerless
speech as less competent and knowledgeable, but speech style had no
effect on competence and knowledgeability ratings for men. These
gender-based speech differences and their accompanying effects are
not well understood, and the few studies that have examined speech
style effects in the employment interview context have important limitations that warrant the extension of this research (Bradac & Mulac,
1984; Wiley & Eskilson, 1985). While prior studies have found that a
powerful speech style is generally perceived more favorably than a
powerless style, the studies relied exclusively on undergraduate
respondents. A majority of the employment interview research also
has been conducted using undergraduates. One effect of this subject
choice is that undergraduate respondents tend to rate interviewees
more favorably and less carefully than professional managers do (Barr
& Hitt, 1986; Gordon, Slade, & Schmitt, 1986). In addition, professional
managers are typically older, more educated, and more gender biased,
which in turn affects interviewee evaluations (Hall & Frederickson,
1979; Slevin & Wingrove, 1983). Generalizations based on undergraduate evaluations of interviewees are thus problematic and may indicate a weakness in the ecological validity of the accompanying results.

RATIONALE
To develop a better understanding of powerful and powerless speech
styles, an extension of Wiley and Eskilson's (1985) study in the employment interview context is warranted. Because Wiley and Eskilson may
have confounded their results by combining hedges, hesitations, and
intensifiers to form a powerless interviewee message, this study seeks
to refine their operationalization of powerless speech by using only
hedges and hesitations to form the powerless interviewee message. As
previously indicated, hedges and hesitations are consistently perceived as powerless. Thus,
Hypothesis 1: Interviewees using a powerful speech style will be rated as
significantly more employable than interviewees using a powerless
speech style.

Carli (1990) argued that gender differences in speech occur primarily when men and women are together and are less likely to occur in
same-sex situations. When women communicate with men, women
speak more tentatively than when they speak with other women. Tentative speech enhances a woman's ability to persuade a man but not
another woman. This finding has implications for mixed-sex interview
groups in that a male interviewer may evaluate a woman using a powerless speech style more positively than he would a woman using a
powerful speech style. Given that the employment interview research
indicates that a mixed panel of interviewers has the highest validity,
and that the powerful and powerless speech style research indicates
that men and women evaluate the speech styles differently, an examination of how men and women evaluate interviewees' speech style in
same- and mixed-sex dyads would provide considerable insight. Therefore, we pose the following research question.
Research Question 1: Will interviewees' powerful and powerless speech
styles be evaluated differently on dynamism, social attractiveness, competence, and employability in same-sex versus mixed-sex interview
dyads?

Finally, because a majority of the powerful and powerless speech
style and employment interview studies have been conducted using
undergraduate respondents, and because undergraduates have been
found to rate interviewees differently than professionals do, we expect
that undergraduate respondents will also evaluate the speech styles
differently than professionals. Thus,
Hypothesis 2: Professional respondents will rate interviewees lower on dynamism, social attractiveness, competence, and employability than will
undergraduate respondents.

METHOD
RESPONDENTS

One hundred eighty five undergraduates and 156 professionals volunteered to participate in this study. The undergraduate participants
were from speech communication courses at a mid-sized public university, ranged in age from 16 to 35 years (M = 18-30, SD = .21), and consisted of 97 (52%) women and 88 (48%) men.
The professionals routinely interviewed people for employment.
They were selected from local hospitals, employment agencies, banks,
public schools, universities, professional associations, and businesses.
The professionals had an average of 16 years of experience, and their
mean education level was a bachelor's degree. These respondents
ranged in age from 21 to older than 66 (M = 41-50, SD = .98) and
included 77 (49%) women and 79 (51%) men.
MESSAGES

Following Wiley and Eskilson (1985) and R. Adler (1992), the primary
message consisted of a 460-word, 3.5-minute audiotape of an interviewee applying for an entry-level banking position. The 3.5-minute
portion began midway through the interview, omitting opening and
closing remarks. The original version did not contain hedges or hesitations and was based on an exemplary interview published in a basic
business communication text (R. Adler, 1992) and on Wiley and
Eskilson's interview. Following Hosman (1989) and Hosman and
Siltanen (1994), a powerless version of the message was created by
adding 15 hedges and 15 hesitations to the interviewee's responses.
Hedges were operationalized as words or phrases such as "kind of,"
"sort of," and "I think." Hesitations were operationalized by such utterances as "uh," "well," and "you know." Because most employment interviews are oral, the messages were audiotaped to enhance the ecological
validity of the study. The role-play was taped at a local radio station,
and the parts were played by four professionals who regularly interview people. Messages were then presented in a 2 (interviewer gender)
x 2 (interviewee gender) x 2 (speech power) between-subjects design.
See Appendix A for the kernel message.
GENDER

Interviewer and interviewee genders were manipulated by using
one man and one woman who each interviewed a male and female
interviewee. Respondents of both genders were included in the respondent pool in both the undergraduate and professional samples.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES

In an attempt to address the lack of consistency in the measurement
scales used to study the speech style effects, this study used validated
scales from previous research (Hosman & Siltanen, 1994; Zahn & Hopper, 1985). Specifically, respondents evaluated interviewees' dynamism, social attractiveness, superiority, control over self, control over
others, and employability using 18 Likert-type 5-point scales (see
Appendix B). Zahn and Hopper's (1985) Speech Evaluation Instrument was used to measure dynamism (Items 1-3), social attractiveness
(Items 4-6), and superiority (Items 7-9). Control over self and control
over others were measured using Hosman and Siltanen's (1994) scales
(Items 10-15). Employability was measured using a scale developed for
this study (Items 16-18).
PROCEDURE

The researcher met undergraduate respondents at their regular
class meeting and the professional respondents at their place of business. The between-subjects design required the placement of professional respondents in the eight message conditions to achieve a balanced design. Respondents listened to the taped interview message
and then immediately completed the questionnaire.

RESULTS
The entire data sets of dependent measures were factor analyzed
using a principal components analysis with varimax rotation. For an
item to load on a factor, its primary loading had to be at least .60, with
no secondary loading exceeding .40. The analysis produced four factors. The first was a Dynamism dimension, defined by the following
items and their loadings: talkative (.63), aggressive (.80), and domineering (.62). Cronbach's alpha for this dimension was .61.1 The second
factor was Social Attractiveness and contained the following items:
sweet (.80), nice (.86), and good-natured (.79). Cronbach's alpha was
.84. The third factor was a Competence dimension, containing the following items and their loadings: literate (.78), educated (.73), composed (.74), and self-controlled (.71). Cronbach's alpha was .85. The
final dimension was an Employability factor with the following items:
intention to hire (.85), confidence regarding intention to hire (.85), and
intention to recommend (.83). Cronbach's alpha was .93.
Based on these analyses, factor scores were computed and used in
subsequent analyses. Primary hypotheses were based on the individual effects of the manipulated and measured variables. Note that only

results directly related to the hypotheses and research question are
reported, although several other gender effects were significant.2
Dynamism.Tests revealed that undergraduates (M = .12) evaluated
the interviewees higher on dynamism than did professionals (M = -.15),
F(1,294) = 3.76, p < .05, 2 = .01. Results, as shown in Table 1, indicated
that female respondents evaluated the powerless style significantly
higher on dynamism than did male respondents, F(1, 294) = 5.17, p <
.02, 2 = .04.
Social attractiveness. Univariate tests revealed that female interviewees using a powerless speech style were evaluated higher on social
attractiveness (M = .36) than when they used a powerful speech style
(M = .02), whereas male interviewees were not evaluated differently
with respect to social attractiveness irrespective of speech style (powerful style M = -.15, powerless style M = -.19), F(1, 294) = 4.31, p < .04,
2 = .01.
Competence. Results indicate that interviewees using a powerful
speech style were rated higher on competence (M = .20) than those
using a powerless speech style (M = -.21), F(1, 294) = 13.99, p < .0001,
2 = .05. In addition, undergraduates evaluated the interviewees
higher on competence than did professionals, F(1, 294) = 9.06, p < .003,
2 = .03 (see Table 2).

152

Interaction effects were also observed. Professional interviewers
evaluated a powerless speech style as significantly less competent
than a powerful speech style; however, undergraduates did not differ
significantly in their assessments across styles, F(1, 294) = 4.09, p <
.04, 2 = .08.
Employability. Tests showed that speakers using a powerful speech
style (M = .24) were thought to be more employable than speakers using
a powerless style (M = -.22), F(1, 294) = 13.24, p < .0001, 2 = .04. Also,
undergraduates (M = .20) rated interviewees higher on employability
than did professionals (M = -.24), F(1, 294) = 10.76, p < .001, 2 = .04.

DISCUSSION
Messages affect judgments. At issue here are perceptions and attributions of people. There is mounting evidence that a speaker's use of
hedges and hesitations, a powerless speech style, results in negative
evaluations. As demonstrated by this study, powerless messages affect
our judgments of a person's dynamism, social attractiveness, competence, and employability. This study extends the knowledge of speech
style effects into a largely unexamined context--the employment
interview. It was hypothesized that interviewees using a powerful
speech style would be evaluated as significantly more employable than
interviewees using a powerless speech style. Gender was also examined in the hope that the relationship between powerful and powerless
speech styles and gender would be clarified. In addition, because prior
research has demonstrated that professional managers and undergraduates evaluate interviewees differently, it was hypothesized that
there would be differences between professionals' and undergraduates' evaluations of interviewees using powerful and powerless speech
styles.
Hypothesis 1 was supported in that interviewees using a powerful
speech style were evaluated more favorably than those using a powerless speech style. Although the use of a powerful style results in a
greater likelihood of employability, it is not clear why. Previous
research postulated that powerful speech style effects might be
explained in terms of certainty or control (Hosman, 1989; Hosman &
Siltanen, 1994). Attributions of control over self and control over others were found to be associated with certain components of the speech
styles. However, in this study, these control dimensions in the attributions of powerful and powerless speech styles did not emerge as a factor. One reason for the inconsistent results may be the respondents
used in this study. Previous powerful and powerless speech style
research used undergraduate respondents only, whereas this study
used professionals and undergraduates. Importantly, the results

Parton et al. / INTERVIEWS AND SPEECH STYLES

153

revealed a significant difference in professionals' and undergraduates'
evaluations of the speech styles. Specifically, undergraduates gave
higher overall evaluations of the speech styles and distinguished less
between them, whereas professionals evaluated the powerful speech
style as significantly more competent than the powerless speech style.
Even though this study did not find support for the control explanation, the speech style effects may be explained in terms of certainty.
This involves two issues. First, a speaker using a powerless speech
style may clearly indicate a lack of confidence or certainty in himself or
herself. However, the converse may not be true: A powerful speech style
may not necessarily indicate confidence or certainty. As Hosman and
Siltanen (1994) concluded, a powerful speech style may only indicate
power, certainty, or confidence when compared to a powerless speech
style. Second, certainty and control may be distinct constructs.
Hosman and Siltanen suggested that control-over-self and controlover-others explanations may fall under the broader construct of certainty. A speaker using a powerful speech style may be perceived as
having control and, therefore, certainty. However, it is possible that a
speaker may generate an impression of certainty without conveying
control over self or control over others. Another possibility, suggested
by Erickson et al. (1978), is that a powerless speech style may be too
costly for listeners because it makes them work harder to understand
the speaker.
The research question was developed to examine whether men and
women evaluate interviewees using powerful and powerless speech
styles differently when in same- and mixed-sex interview dyads. No
significant difference was found. It should be noted that there is not a
clear link between gender and speech styles. This is consistent with
past research that found gender did not have an understandable connection with speech style (Bradac & Mulac, 1984; Hosman, 1989;
Mulac & Bradac, 1995), although some interaction has been found
(Erickson et al., 1978; Wright & Hosman, 1983). As Mulac and Bradac
(1995) argued, the relationship between gender, language, and power
is much more complex than can be understood at this time.
Hypothesis 2 was supported, however. Undergraduates rated interviewees higher on all dimensions than did professionals, as was also
found by Barr and Hitt (1986). Moreover, professionals evaluated the
powerful speech style as more competent than the powerless speech
style, whereas undergraduates did not distinguish between the speech
styles. This further supports the argument that professionals should
be used as respondents in both employment interview and powerful
and powerless speech style research.
This study has important implications for employment interview
research, as well as for interviewees. First, although the use of professional respondents may increase research costs, the results here suggest that such a respondent selection may be necessary because of the

154

JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY / June 2002

substantial differences between undergraduate and professional populations. One positive aspect of the use of undergraduates does bear
mention, however. Because professionals tend to be more discriminating in rating prospective employees than undergraduates, the use of
undergraduates would tend to attenuate any results. Thus, real-world
effects would likely be stronger than those found in a laboratory with
an undergraduate sample and consequently would provide researchers with greater confidence than previously may have been justified.
Still, differences between the two respondent populations are not well
understood, so results based on undergraduate subjects must necessarily be interpreted and generalized with caution.
It also is becoming increasingly clear that a powerful speech style
results in attributions of competence and employability. Because
impression formation is vital to interview success, interviewees should
be counseled to adopt this style.
At least three limitations restrict the generalizability of this study.
First, respondents listened to an interview rather than speaking
directly with the interviewee. Although this was done to control for
confounding nonverbal variables, realism was sacrificed as most
employment interviews involve face-to-face communication. Because
some initial employment interview screenings occur via telephone to
control costs and reduce the number of applicants to a manageable
size, this lack of realism was deemed to be acceptable.
Second, the use of professional voices for the interviewers and interviewees may have limited the results. Their vocal quality is close to
ideal and therefore does not represent that of the general population.
Respondents may have unknowingly responded to this high vocal quality when making evaluations, although professional voices were necessary to control for confounding paralinguistic variables.
A third limitation we note is the use of fictitious persons. In the real
world, it would be extremely rare for identical applicants to apply for
the same job. However, fictitious persons were used to control for confounding variables.
Overall, this investigation of the powerful and powerless speech
style effects on employment interview outcomes yielded results generally consistent with previous research on speech style effects. The use
of hedges and hesitations, characterized as powerless forms of speech,
affect impression formation negatively. Generally, a powerless speech
style results in negative attributions of employability and competence.
Furthermore, consistent with past research, a powerful speech style
results in higher evaluations of competence but not social attractiveness (Bradac, Hemphill, & Tardy, 1981).
Several directions for future research are suggested by the study.
First, nonverbal elements, especially dress and physical attraction,
might be examined in connection with speech styles. Because most
employment interviews are conducted face to face, having interviewers

Parton et al. / INTERVIEWS AND SPEECH STYLES

155

view videotapes of interviewees using powerful and powerless speech
would be more realistic. In addition, it would be more realistic if interviewers examined a resume that could affect their expectations of the
interviewee. It would be interesting to see how the paper credentials
and speech styles interact, if at all.
Second, individual components of powerful and powerless speech
might be examined in contexts other than the employment interview.
Informal situations, such as conversations between friends or colleagues, should be studied to determine speech style effects. Results of
such research may or may not support Johnson and Vinson's (1987)
speculation that women using powerful speech may not find it as
advantageous in an informal setting as it is in a formal setting where
clearly defined roles and norms are established.
Finally, the relationship between gender and speech styles still
needs greater clarification. After 20 years of research, the relationship
between gender, language, and power cannot be defined. While physical gender may not be manipulated, a person may strategically use his
or her speech style to form the desired impression for a particular situation. For example, if a woman desires to be perceived as socially
attractive, she should use a powerless speech style to fit others' expectations and thus be evaluated positively. On the other hand, if a woman
desires a potential employer to perceive her as competent, then she
should use a powerful speech style. If a person understands how his or
her gender interacts with a particular speech style, then that person
can use these variables to form the desired impression. Another practical application is that the knowledge gained from research that clarifies the gender, language, and power relationship could be used to
reduce gender stereotypes. By understanding the role of gender and
language in the formation of these stereotypes, education and training
could be used to change them.
As research has failed to explain the role between gender and speech
styles, the question of whether it is important to understand this relationship may be asked. The answer is yes. Since Aristotle's time, the
role of ethos has been shown to be very important in persuasion. In the
employment interview context, an interviewee has to persuade the
interviewer that he or she is the most credible person for the job. Ethos
includes the dimensions of dynamism, social attractiveness, and competence, all of which were found in this study on the effects of the powerful and powerless speech styles in the employment interview context. However, it is not accurate to conclude that the use of a powerful
speech style results in attributions of high credibility. This study found
that the use of a powerful speech style did result in higher attributions
of competence, but not necessarily in higher attributions of dynamism
and social attractiveness. The absence of significant main effects for
speech style on these two dimensions indicates that speech style alone
may be insufficient to affect credibility. However, when combined with

156

gender, speech style can alter credibility ratings. Further research is
clearly necessary to understand the complex relationship between
gender and speech style effects.
APPENDIX A
Stimulus Interview With Both Powerful and Powerless Speech
Response (Powerless Version Appears in Parentheses)
Employer: How did you get interested in banking?
Interviewee: (Well,) Four years ago when I was a senior in college, I had an
(a kind of) internship with a bank, and (uh) more recently I've been in
charge of negotiating with a bank about a loan for the company I currently work for. Banking seems (sort of) like a complex and demanding
career.
Employer: How did you learn about Illinois Trust?
Interviewee: (Well,) Since I've lived in this area all my life, I've known about
you for as long as I can remember. (I think) I used to hear your commercials on the radio when I was a child. I learned (a little) about your
management-training program through an article in the Tribune.
Employer: Where do you see yourself fitting into the organization?
Interviewee: Frankly, I'd like to work (a little) in commercial lending. The
challenge of dealing with large accounts and the decision making involved in dealing with corporations is (I guess) the type of responsibility
I've always wanted.
Employer: What skills or background do you have that recommend you for
that kind of position?
Interviewee: (Let's see--) In college I was an economics major and took some
accounting and a couple of statistics courses. (Uh,) I was also in debate,
which taught me how to present a logical argument. In my present job,
I've had to handle a number of financial negotiations. (Well,) All of these
experiences, plus my interest in this work will (kind of) help me handle
the demands of such a position.
Employer: Where would you like to be in 5 years?
Interviewee: (I guess,) In 5 years, I'd like to have had several promotions
and be in a position of responsibility--dealing with (well) important accounts. My goals would be (you see) to have attained the rank of consumer lending officer. I'm also giving some thought to getting an M.B.A.
in night school.
Employer: How would you describe your strengths and weaknesses?
Interviewee: (Well,) I'm a very hard worker, I'm organized, and (uh) I like to
succeed. But I do tend to do too much at times--I'm (sort of) a compulsive
worker. I find it hard to say no to (maybe) an interesting project or to people who come to me with problems. (I guess) I spread myself too thin.
Employer: If you were to pick a boss, what are the important traits that he or
she should have?
Interviewee: (Let's see) He or she should have lots of follow-up--letting people know where they stand. The ability to give criticism constructively
(sometimes) and to compliment good work. Giving people a task and
then leaving them alone, without nagging.

Employer: But still being there to help if it's needed, right?
Interviewee: Sure. But also giving me the space to finish a job without staying (a little) too close. Being available for help, as you said. Being consistent. And being willing (sometimes) to train employees in new jobs, letting them grow. And (uh) considering the personal goals of employees.
Employer: What are the factors that motivate you?
Interviewee: (Well) I like to be busy. If things aren't busy, I still work, but I
like to be stimulated. I seem to get more work done (I think) when I'm
busy than when there's plenty of time. It's crazy, but true. I'm also motivated by the chance to grow and take on as much responsibility as I can
handle.
Employer: Why should we hire you over the others who are applying for this
job?
Interviewee: I'm committed and willing to put in the work necessary to be
successful at Illinois Trust. (You see) I've given this career switch a great
deal of thought, and I have no doubts (you know) that I can do an excellent job.

NOTES
1. Though some would argue that Cronbach's alpha for the Dynamism dimension is
unacceptably low, given the importance of the dynamism construct in speech style research, we believe that its inclusion here is necessary and appropriate, notwithstanding
a borderline indicator of scale reliability (Bradac & Street, 1990). Indeed, according to
DeVellis (1991), any alpha above .60 is acceptable, and an unacceptably low reliability
would have worked against finding significant effects. Given that we found significant
effects on Dynamism, the low reliability is less of a concern.
2. Only significant results most relevant to this study's hypotheses and research
question were reported. However, many other gender effects were significant. A summary of all significant effects is available from the lead author.
