Short-term changes in vowel fundamental frequency (F0) immediately preceding
(F0 offset) and following (F0 onset) production of voiceless obstruents were
examined in groups of 4-year-olds, 8-year-olds, and 21-year-olds. Definitive
patterns of laryngeal behavior were observed for each measure. F0 was found to
significantly lower at vowel offset across age groups, with no significant differences noted between groups, suggesting that F0 offset is simply an acoustic
consequence of producing a voiceless obstruent preceded by a vowel. The F0 at
vowel onset was high and significantly decreased thereafter. Age-related
differences were identified for F0 onset with 4-year-olds in that their F0 rose to a
lesser degree than that of adults. However, adult females demonstrated a greater
change in both F0 onset and F0 offset behavior than adult males and children,
suggesting that age-related differences in F0 behavior are likely to be influenced
by sex. The results are discussed with regard to the physiologic constraints of F0
surrounding voiceless obstruent production in children and adults.

ocal fundamental frequency (F0) is an acoustic measure that reflects the vibratory rate of the vocal folds. Variations in vocal F0
(or vibratory rate) are found to occur along different time intervals (Baken & Orlikoff, 1988). Examples of these time intervals include
long-term variations in F0 that occur from beginning to end of an utterance. This form of F0 variation is generally referred to as the intonation
contour (Crystal, 1969). A shorter time interval is that associated with
the production of syllables or words. Variations in F0 at the syllable/
word level are used to denote stress (Bolinger, 1958; Crystal, 1969; Ohde
& Sharf, 1992; Olive, Greenwood, & Coleman, 1993). Vocal F0 can vary
across syllables making up a polysyllabic word (i.e., lexical stress), and
F0 can vary across words in order to indicate (or contrast) their importance in relation to other words in a sentence (i.e., sentence stress). Vocal F0 also varies at the level of the phonetic segment, such as changes
in vowel F0 that occur immediately preceding or following production of
a consonant. F0 variation immediately preceding a consonant is referred
to as phonetically governed devoicing (Watson, 1998). F0 variation immediately following consonant production is referred to as instantaneous
F0 (Baken & Orlikoff, 1988) or phonetically governed voicing (House &
Fairbanks, 1953).
Control of F0 is accomplished by a combination of several variables,
notably the length, mass, and stiffness of the vocal folds (Hollien & Hicks,
1979). Subglottal air pressure, or more specifically translaryngeal

pressure, also serves a primary role in adjusting F0
(Titze, 1989). Presumably, variations in F0 occurring at
each time interval are influenced by these laryngeal and
aerodynamic variables. However, it is unlikely the
speaker exerts deliberate control over these variables
at each time interval (Baken & Orlikoff, 1988). For example, a rise in F0 at the end of a question or a fall at
the end of a statement is part of the linguistic code and
thus a deliberate act by the speaker to control F0 (Titze,
1994). Similarly, adjustments in F0 at the syllable level
to differentiate word meaning (e.g., OBject vs. obJECT)
are linguistically motivated and are intentionally controlled by the speaker. However, variations in F0 occurring at the level of the phonetic segment are thought to
be a direct consequence of laryngeal adjustments required for articulatory events (Hirose, 1977; Sawashima
& Hirose, 1983).
Given that F0 variations occurring at the segmental
level are least likely to result from deliberate speaker
control, this time interval provides an ideal context in
which to evaluate laryngeal behavior whereby the effects of idiosyncratic speaking style (i.e., long-term intervals) are minimized (Watson, 1998). In this study, we
explored whether age-related differences existed in F0
occurring at the level of the phonetic segment. That is,
do the laryngeal adjustments required for articulatory
events undergo developmental change? Two measures
of F0 were selected, F0 onset and F0 offset, to examine
the laryngeal behavior surrounding voiceless obstruent
production. Before reporting the results of this study, a
brief review of the literature pertaining to F0 onset and
F0 offset is provided.

F0 Onset
F0 onset is a measure of laryngeal voicing at vowel
onset that is phonetically governed by the preceding
consonant (House & Fairbanks, 1953). F0 onset is typically derived by examining changes in the first 5-10
vocal cycles of a vowel following obstruent production
(e.g., [bi], [si]) (Ohde, 1984; Watson, 1998). A consistent
finding among young adult and elderly adult speakers
is that F0 tends to be highest during the first vocal cycles
at vowel onset and rapidly lowers thereafter, irrespective of the particular manner of production (namely, stop
or fricative) (House & Fairbanks, 1953; Lofqvist, Baer,
McGarr, & Story, 1989; Umeda, 1981). F0 is also higher
and decreases faster after voicing onset for voiceless than
voiced consonants (Silverman, 1986; Umeda, 1981). A
combination of laryngeal and aerodynamic factors are
thought to influence F0 at voicing onset. Stevens (1977)
suggests that an increase in vocal fold tension is used to
inhibit vibration in voiceless consonants, and the influence of this increased tension in the consonant carries

over into an adjacent vowel, which is shown acoustically
as a raised F0. This interpretation of F0 onset is supported by Lofqvist et al. (1989), who provided electromyographic data showing the cricothyroid muscle (a vocal
fold tensor) to be particularly active during the F0 onset
gesture. Baken and Orlikoff (1988) suggest that the F0
following consonant production results from changes in
translaryngeal pressure induced by consonant articulation. During production of voiceless obstruents (as opposed to voiced obstruents), there is a high rate of airflow through the glottis that creates a higher Bernoulli
force that rapidly adducts the vocal folds and is revealed
as a high F0 at voicing onset (Ladefoged, 1967).
Minimal research has examined F0 onset behavior
in children. Subsequently, the developmental profile with
regard to this particular laryngeal behavior is sketchy.
Ohde (1985) examined F0 onset specific to stop consonant production in six 8- to 9-year-old children. These
results were then compared with those of an earlier
study of three adult males (Ohde, 1984). Results of the
comparative analysis found children to use F0 in a fashion similar to that of adults, although children showed
significantly greater F0 variability than adults. Both children and adults used a high F0 at voicing onset that
significantly lowered during subsequent vocal cycles.
The similar pattern of F0 behavior between 8- to 9-yearolds and adults would indicate equivalent laryngeal adjustments at the segmental level. However, this pattern
of F0 behavior is not yet apparent in very young children. Robb and Saxman (1985) examined F0 onset in
children between 11 and 25 months old. Measuring
narrowband spectrograms, F0 was determined for a wide
range of vowel segments that varied in syllabic composition (e.g., CV, CVC). F0 onset was derived from the
first moment of periodicity on the spectrogram, which
was then compared to the overall average F0 of the same
vowel segment. In contrast to studies of older children
and adults, F0 was not significantly higher at voicing
onset than the overall F0. Although the Ohde (1984,
1985) and the Robb and Saxman studies differed in
methodology, the general conclusion drawn from this
comparison is that instantaneous F0 (i.e., that occurring
at the level of the phonetic segment) may undergo developmental maturation. The phonetically governed
voicing behavior found in 8- to 9-year-olds is not yet
apparent in the speech of 2-year-olds.
Assuming that a combination of laryngeal and aerodynamic factors influence F0 at the segmental level, it
is perhaps not surprising to find differences in F0 onset
behavior between 2-year-olds and 8-year-olds. During
early childhood, the anatomical structures associated
with speech production do not develop uniformly, and
thus changes in the structures that occur during development will have varying degrees of influence as to their

acoustic consequences (Callan, Kent, Guenther, &
Vorperian, 2000). Marked structural changes occur in
supralaryngeal and laryngeal anatomy between 2 and
6 years old (Crelin, 1987; Fletcher, 1973; Kent, 1999).
By age 3, the vocal folds double in size--from 2 mm at
birth to over 5 mm (Hirano, Kurita, & Nakashima, 1981).
There is a gradual descent of the larynx to a lower position in the neck (Crelin, 1987) as well as descent of the
posterior part of the tongue, with substantial growth of
the tongue noted between 3 and 4 years old (Kent &
Vorperian, 1995). Before age 8 a child's motor control
related to purposeful speech production is more variable than that of older children (Kent & Forner, 1980;
Smith, 1978). In contrast, by age 8 the configuration of
a child's vocal tract clearly resembles that of an adult
(Crelin, 1989; Kent, 1999). The past finding of comparable F0 onset behavior between 8-year-olds and adults
(Ohde, 1985) may simply reflect the results of "roughly"
comparable vocal anatomies--at least for this particular form of laryngeal behavior. One aim of the present
research was to determine whether children younger
than 8 but older than 2 demonstrate phonetically governed voicing behavior.

F0 Offset
F0 offset is a measure of laryngeal devoicing that is
phonetically governed by the consonant that follows. F0
offset is typically derived by examining changes in the
last 5 to 10 vocal cycles of a vowel preceding production
of a voiceless obstruent (e.g., [ip], [is]) (Watson, 1998).
Although F0 onset has received considerable attention,
far less interest has been paid to examining F0 offset.
Among young adult speakers, the F0 of vowels preceding voiceless obstruents tends to increase slightly
(Watson, 1998). The increase in F0 at vowel offset is
thought to represent a combination of vocal fold abduction and tensing in preparation for voiceless obstruent
production. Interestingly, an opposite pattern of F0 is
found for aged speakers. Watson (1998) found normal
elderly speakers (M = 74 years old) to show a significant
decrease in F0 at vowel offset, which was attributed to
morphologic and neuromuscular changes in the aging
vocal mechanism. These age-related changes lead to a
sole reliance on vocal fold abduction to achieve devoicing. Thus, although there are no apparent differences
in F0 onset behavior between young adults and elderly
adults, there appear to be age-related differences in F0
offset behavior. It is therefore reasonable to speculate
that the laryngeal behavior immediately preceding obstruent production is not precisely the same as the behavior following obstruent production.
The developmental course of F0 offset behavior displayed by children of any age is unknown. Because F0
offset is affected by changes in an aging vocal anatomy
448

during latter periods of the human lifespan, we wished
to explore whether changes in F0 offset behavior might
likewise result from a developing vocal anatomy during
the childhood period. Therefore, a second aim of this
study was to determine if young children demonstrate
phonetically governed devoicing behavior and, if so, to
examine whether this behavior changes as a function of
increasing age.

Method
Participants
Three groups of 10 participants were recruited for
study. The groups consisted of 4-year-olds (M = 4;5),
8-year-olds (M = 8;5), and 21-year-olds (M = 21;2). Each
group included 5 females and 5 males. Four-year-olds
were recruited in order to capture a period when developmental changes in vocal anatomy might be occurring.
The two groups of children were recruited from a public
school system in central Massachusetts, and the 21-yearolds were recruited from the undergraduate student body
at the University of Connecticut (Storrs). None of the
participants was suspected to have a speech, language,
or hearing disorder at the time of data collection. All
children were deemed to demonstrate normal communication behavior as determined by either parent or
teacher report. Self-report by the 21-year-olds was used
to confirm normal communication behavior. The normalcy of each participant's speech and language was
confirmed at the time of data collection. Each participant's conversational speech was informally evaluated by one of the researchers (A.S.), who is a certified
speech-language pathologist.

Procedures
The procedures for measuring F0 onset and F0 offset closely paralleled those of Watson (1998). Each participant was audiotape recorded as he or she produced
four sentences. The specific sentences follow: (1) A new
seed grows fast. (2) The two keys are old. (3) The pea
soup is good. (4) I see Pooh bear. The sentence, A new
seed grows fast, was identical to the sentence examined
by Watson. The specific sentences were selected to
sample a broader range of variations in place and manner of articulation within a V1-C-V2 speaking context
than were sampled in previous investigations of this
nature. The specific V1-C-V2 contexts were [u-s-i] from
new seed, [u-k-i] from two keys, [i-s-u] from pea soup,
and [i-p-u] from see Pooh. The sentences also varied with
regard to the location of stress boundaries. Sentences
1-3 were produced with stronger emphasis placed on
V1 than on V2. Sentence 4 was produced with stronger emphasis placed on V2 than on V1. Similar to past

research (Ohde, 1984, 1985; Watson, 1998), use of
sentence-length speech samples allowed for an examination of F0 onset and F0 offset in a relatively natural
speaking context.
Each sentence was produced three times by each
participant for a total of 12 samples per participant.
The researcher modeled the sentences before each
participant's productions. Each sentence was produced
on one expiratory breath group. Individuals were allowed
to practice the speech materials as often as they wished
before the actual audio recordings. Order of sentence
presentation was randomized across participants. During the recording, if the researcher noted that a sentence was not produced correctly (e.g., misarticulations,
hesitancies, incorrect stress placement), the participant
was required to repeat the sentence. Each participant
spoke into a unidirectional dynamic microphone (Shure
515SD) that was handheld at approximately 12 inches
from his or her mouth. Participants used a self-selected
vocal F0, and no attempt was made to control for voice
intensity. No deviations from habitual F0 and intensity
were observed during the recordings. Specifically, the
4-year-old and 8-year-old groups were able to use a typical speaking voice devoid of "silly" or noncompliant vocal behaviors. All productions were recorded on low-noise
magnetic audiotape using a cassette recorder (Sony

TCM-5000EV). All productions were obtained in locations judged to be low in ambient noise. The 4-year-old
and 8-year-old children were recorded individually in
an enclosed room with a carpeted floor. The 21-year-olds
were recorded in a sound-attenuated booth available at
the University of Connecticut.

Acoustic Analysis
The four sentences were digitized using a different
cassette recorder (Nakamichi MR2) and fed into a computer (CPU586). All acoustic signals were digitized at
a 10,000 Hz sampling rate with 16 bits of resolution,
using a commercially available speech analysis system
(Kay CSL-4300). The CSL system employs an antialiasing presampling filter that is dependent upon the
sampling rate. Aliasing artifact was avoided by filtering all energy above 5000 Hz. Each sentence was displayed as an amplitude-by-time waveform. On the basis of this waveform, the V1-C-V2 context was
demarcated using a pair of vertical cursors and magnified. An example of a typical V1-C-V2 waveform is provided in Figure 1. The following acoustic features were
measured from each magnified waveform:

monitor. The peak of each vocal cycle was isolated using
a vertical cursor. Adjacent peaks were identified in a
forward fashion, and the period of each vocal cycle was
measured. The F0 for each vocal cycle was determined
as the reciprocal of the period. Age-group data for each
phrase were based on a total of 30 F0 onset samples (e.g.,
10 participants per age group, each of whom produced
three repetitions of each phrase).
F0 Offset: The last 10 vocal cycles of V1 preceding
the voiceless consonant were identified. The period of
each vocal cycle was measured in a peak-to-peak fashion. The F0 for each period was determined as the reciprocal of the period. F0 offset was measured by examining the pattern of change in F0 of the last 10 vocal cycles
of V1 preceding production of the voiceless consonant.
Age-group data for each phrase were based on a total of
30 F0 offset samples.
Once the 10 vocal cycles were collected for each V1
and V2 context, the F0 values for each cycle were normalized by converting them to semitone values relative
to a reference cycle. For F0 onset and F0 offset, the reference cycle was the vocal cycle (among the 10 cycles) furthest away from the voiceless consonant (Watson, 1998).
There were two reasons for normalizing F0 values. First,
use of semitone values rather than absolute F0 values
allowed for evaluating changes across participants' sex
and age groups, in spite of natural differences in rate of
vocal fold vibration. Second, young children and elderly
adults are known to have higher intrasubject and intersubject variability in intonation contour than children
and young adults (e.g., Eguchi & Hirsh, 1969; Linville
& Fisher, 1985; Robb, Saxman, & Grant, 1989). Watson
(1998) cautions that long-term variations of F0 (e.g., intonation contour) displayed by different age groups may
have a powerful effect of obscuring variations associated with F0 onset and F0 offset that are likely to be of
smaller magnitude. Therefore, in order to minimize effects of intrasubject and intersubject variability associated with the intonation contour, conversion to semitone values relative to a reference cycle is recommended.

Reliability
Identification of individual vocal cycles was considered the critical measurement procedure necessary to
perform the F0 onset and F0 offset calculations. Measurement reliability was examined by having a second
researcher measure a random sampling of 10% of the
database collected for each age group (36 V1-C-V2
phrases). The period of each vocal cycle was compared
with the original values obtained for the same vocal
cycle. The results of this comparison indicated a mean
measurement difference across all vocal cycles (V1 and
V2 samples) of 0.11 ms. The correlation coefficient between the original and remeasured vowels was r = 0.96.
450

Statistical Analysis
Separate analyses were performed for each V1 and
V2 data set. Each data set was submitted to a 3 x 10
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
(Statistica, 1997) to evaluate the change in average semitone values across the 10 vocal cycles for the three age
groups. Age was the between-groups factor, and vocal
cycle was the within-groups factor. Differences according to vocal cycle were examined to provide a general
evaluation of the changes in F0 that occurred closest to,
and furthest away from, the voiceless obstruent. An a
priori alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. When significant effects were found for
age or vocal cycle, p values were adjusted using the
Bonferroni procedure to reduce the possibility of making a Type I error (Kirk, 1982).

Results
F0 Onset
The F0 onset results for each phrase were initially
analyzed using a series of 3 x 10 ANOVA tests. Results
of this analysis were highly similar across the four
phrases; therefore subsequent analyses were performed
by collapsing the individual data across all phrases. For
each participant, vocal cycle data for each V2 were combined to provide an overall summary of F0 onset. The
average F0 onset values for each vocal cycle, collapsed
across the four phrases, are listed in Table 1. Because of
known sex differences in average F0 following puberty
(Kahane, 1978), the data for 21-year-olds are presented
by participants' sex. For each age group a decrease in F0
was observed between vocal cycle 1 and vocal cycle 10.
The highest F0 values were associated with the cycles
nearest the obstruent, and the lowest F0 values were
those furthest from the obstruent.
The F0 values were next converted to semitone values referenced to the cycle furthest from the voiceless
obstruent. For this analysis, data obtained for 21-yearolds were collapsed across sex. The semitone values for
each participant within each age group were averaged.
A summary of the F0 onset results, according to semitone values, is displayed in panel A of Figure 2. The data
points shown in the figure reflect an average of 120 semitone values collected for each age group. Across age
groups, there was a general trend of decreasing semitone values following production of a voiceless obstruent.
Results of a 3 x 10 ANOVA revealed a significant age
effect [F(2, 18) = 3.50, p < .007]. The V2 was produced
with a significantly greater change in semitone values
by the 21-year-olds than the 4-year-olds (p < .01). A significant main effect was found for vocal cycle [F(9, 10) =
16.57, p < .0001]. Results of alpha-adjusted Scheffe t
tests indicated a significantly higher F0 (p < .001) in the

The age-group variability associated with the vocal
cycle of each V2 is plotted in panel B of Figure 2. For all
groups, there was a trend toward decreasing F0 variability, with the largest variability associated with those
cycles immediately following consonant production. Visual examination of the figure indicates that 21-year-olds
showed the greatest variability across vocal cycles (as
compared with that of the 4-year-olds and 8-year-olds).

F0 Offset
Analysis of the F0 offset results obtained for each
phrase were highly similar. Therefore, the results for
each phrase were further summarized. For each participant, vocal cycle data for each V1 were combined to
provide an overall summary of F0 offset. The resulting
average F0 offset values for each vocal cycle are listed in
Table 2. For each age group a decrease in average F0 is
observed between vocal cycle 1 and vocal cycle 10.
The corresponding semitone values, referenced to
the vocal cycle furthest from the obstruent, are displayed

in panel A of Figure 2. Across age groups, there was a
general trend of decreasing F0, with the most negative
change in semitone values associated with the cycles
nearest the voiceless consonant. A 3 x 10 ANOVA was
performed to evaluate the change in average semitone values across the 10 vocal cycles for the three age
groups. A significant main effect was found for vocal cycle
[F(9, 10) = 31.93, p < .0001]; however, there was no significant difference observed across age groups (p > .05).
A significant age-by-vocal-cycle interaction was found
[F(9, 10) = 2.10, p < .007]. Post hoc testing was subsequently performed to evaluate age differences that may
have existed at specific vocal cycles. The 8-year-old group
demonstrated a significantly greater lowering in F0 at
the later vocal cycles (p < .005) than did the 4-year-old
and 21-year-old groups.

would cause an imbalance with respect to the duration
of vocal behavior evaluated. For example, the low F0 (or
long vocal cycles) found in adult males compared to females and children would result in a cumulatively longer
sample of vocal behavior collected for adult males. Alternatively, balancing groups according to a predetermined length of vocal behavior (e.g., 50 ms) would lead
to an imbalance with respect to the number of vocal
cycles evaluated. For example, the high F0 (or shorter
vocal cycles) found in children or females as compared
with adult males would result in a cumulatively larger
sample of vocal cycles within a predetermined length of
vocal behavior. Past investigations of this nature that
compared children to adults (Ohde, 1985) or adult females to males (Watson, 1998) elected to balance groups
with regard to the number of vocal cycles.

The overall age group variability associated with
the vocal cycle of V1 is plotted in panel B of Figure 2.
For all groups there was a trend toward increasing F0
variability, with the largest variability associated with
those cycles immediately before consonant production.
The 4-year-olds appeared to show greater variability
across vocal cycles than the 8-year-olds and 21-year-olds.

The present study controlled for the number of vocal cycles collected (i.e., 10 cycles) for each age group.
However, an alternative approach would have been to
examine F0 onset and F0 offset across groups by evaluating a comparable duration of vocal behavior. In order
to assess whether the present F0 findings according to
number of vocal cycles would yield similar results if examined according to vocal duration, a supplemental
analysis was performed. As a method of controlling for
vocal duration, the period for each of the 10 average F0
values (i.e., vocal cycles) reported in Tables 1 and 2 was
computed. Based on the total duration of the 10 vocal
cycles produced by the 4-year-olds, it was determined
that 8 vocal cycles from the 8-year-olds and 21-year-old
women and 4 vocal cycles from the 21-year-old men
would provide roughly equivalent samples of vocal duration. This sampling method was then used to reevaluate changes in F0 immediately preceding and following
consonant production. Because of the reduced number
of vocal cycles for the 8-year-olds and 21-year-olds, the
vocal cycles nearest the consonant were used when recalculating F0 onset and offset.

Supplemental Analyses
When comparing the vocal fold vibratory behavior
of females to males or adults to children, natural differences in the rate of vocal fold vibration are to be expected. Therefore, it is important to ask what constitutes an equivalent sample of vocal behavior in light of
differences in F0. This issue arises in most developmental and sex comparison studies, and the present study
was no exception. The two sampling options available
are (1) sampling a similar number of vocal cycles, or (2)
sampling a similar length of vocal behavior. Balancing
female and male groups (or child and adult groups) according to the number of vocal cycles (e.g., 10 vocal cycles)

Results of the analysis for F0 onset according to vocal duration indicated a change in semitone (ST) values
between the vocal cycle closest and furthest from the
consonant of 2.1 ST for 4-year-olds, 2.5 ST for 8-yearolds, 3.1 ST for 21-year-old women, and 1.6 ST for 21year-old men. Performing the same analysis using all
10 cycles for each group yielded a change in ST between
the first and last vocal cycle of 2.1 ST for 4-year-olds,
2.5-ST for 8-year-olds, 3.3 ST for 21-year-old women,
and 2.3 ST for 21-year-old men. The F0 offset according
to vocal duration indicated a change in ST values between the vocal cycle furthest and closest to the consonant of .86 ST for 4-year-olds, 1.15 ST for 8-year-olds,
1.15 ST for 21-year-old women, and .31 for 21-year-old
men. Using all 10 vocal cycles yielded an ST change of
.86 for 4-year-olds, 1.15 for 8-year-olds, 1.22 for 21-yearold women, and .47 for 21-year-old men.
Two observations can be made from the analysis.
First, the ST values calculated according to vocal duration were comparable to those obtained according to vocal
cycle. The same approximate values were obtained for
specific age groups regardless of the sampling method.
Therefore, it is possible that both methods of sampling
provide similar estimates of vocal fold vibratory behavior, at least for measures of F0 onset and F0 offset. Second, a pattern was noted when separating the 21-yearold group according to participants' sex. The change in
ST for the group of women was consistently higher than
that for the group of men. This pattern was found for
both F0 onset and F0 offset.

Discussion
F0 Onset
Children and adults used a high F0 immediately following voiceless obstruent production, which decreased
significantly by the tenth vocal cycle following vowel
onset. This characteristic pattern of phonetically governed voicing has been noted over the past 40 years
(House & Fairbanks, 1953; Lehiste & Peterson, 1961;
Ohde, 1984; Watson, 1998). The high F0 at vowel onset
is generally attributed to a carryover effect whereby
vocal fold tension is used to inhibit vibration during
voiceless obstruent production, and the tension persists
at vowel onset (Stevens, 1977). The high F0 at vowel
onset has also been shown to serve as a cue for the perception of consonant voice status (Castleman & Diehl,
1996; Diehl & Molis, 1995). Ohde (1985) examined F0
onset specific to stop consonant production and found
no differences between 8-year-olds and adults. He concluded that children and adults show the same characteristic pattern of phonetically governed voicing. The
present findings for 4-year-olds were also indicative of
phonetically governed voicing. However, there were

statistically significant differences observed between
4-year-olds and 21-year-olds. Young adults showed a significantly higher F0 at voicing onset than 4-year-olds.
Assuming that a high F0 at vowel onset is phonetically governed, the differences observed between 4-yearolds and 21-year-olds would indicate that laryngeal voicing may undergo maturational change. A possible
explanation for age-related differences in F0 onset relates to an immature vocal mechanism. A child's vocal
anatomy undergoes dramatic growth during the early
years of life (Crelin, 1987; Fletcher, 1973; Kent, 1999).
These changes might account for the phonetically governed voicing behavior seen in 4-year-olds that is not
apparent in 2-year-olds (Robb & Saxman, 1985). However, a 4-year-old is still unable to initiate voicing similar to that of adults. It is also important to consider the
influence of phonetic context on the observed age differences. F0 onset was measured following production of
voiceless obstruents, specifically /p/, /t/, and two productions of /s/. In each of these contexts, 4-year-olds consistently used a lower F0 at voicing onset than 21-yearolds, suggesting that phonetic context may have played
a minor role in F0 onset. That is, 4-year-olds appeared
to demonstrate the same voicing behavior regardless of
the preceding obstruent (i.e., stop or fricative). Additional
support for this view is provided by a recent acoustic
and aerodynamic report by Koenig (2000), who examined voice onset time (VOT) in 5-year-olds and adults.
Similar to F0 onset, VOT is a measure associated with
the onset of vocal fold vibration. Koenig measured VOT
in prevocalic /p, t/ productions and prevocalic /h/ production (referred to as VOTh) and found that 5-yearolds show significantly greater variability with voicing
onset than adults. Because /h/ is a consonant that does
not require supralaryngeal constriction, the finding of
more variability between children and adults in VOTh
indicated that "some portion of the variability in
children's VOT is best ascribed to purely laryngeal factors" (p. 1225). Therefore, it is possible that voicing initiation, as inferred from either F0 onset or VOT, is a
laryngeal behavior that is less well developed in children than adults.

F0 Offset
The present study found F0 immediately preceding
production of a voiceless obstruent to decrease significantly for each age group. There were no significant differences in F0 offset across the three age groups. Children between 4 and 8 years old appear to demonstrate
phonetically governed devoicing behavior comparable to
that of young adults, and the pattern of decreasing F0 is
similar to that observed in elderly speakers (Watson,
1998). The decrease in F0 at vowel offset noted for 21year-olds conflicts with a previous report that young

adults show a slight increase in F0 at vowel offset
(Watson, 1998). Watson attributed the increase in F0 at
vowel offset among young adults to an ability to regulate vocal fold abductory behavior while maintaining
vocal fold tension in preparation for a voiceless consonant. It is important to note that Watson examined the
devoicing gesture using only one V1-C-V2 context (i.e.,
[u-s-i]), whereas the present study examined the same
context and three others. Interestingly, examination of
the present group data showed the least dramatic drop
in F0 for the [u-s-i] context as compared with the three
remaining contexts. However, there were no differences
found in F0 offset according to phonetic context. The
general pattern across age groups was one of decreasing F0 before obstruent production.
The lowering in F0 at vowel offset may result from
changes in supraglottal and transglottal pressure required for production of a voiceless consonant. F0 offset
is a measure that provides an indirect estimate of the
vocal fold vibratory activity in a vowel immediately preceding production of a voiceless consonant. Production
of vowels and consonants differ with regard to air pressure requirements. A substantial amount of supraglottal pressure is required for production of obstruents, with
far less required for vowels (Warren, Hall, & Davis,
1981). Baken and Orlikoff (1987, 1988) report that during production of consonants, there is an increase in
supraglottal pressure and a corresponding decrease in
transglottal pressure. A drop in pressure across the glottis would be represented acoustically as a lowering in
F0 (Ladefoged, 1967). The lowering in F0 at vowel offset
observed among the present groups would imply that
the vowel was affected by pressure demands required
for the upcoming voiceless consonant. Specifically, the
vocal folds abducted to allow for an increase in supraglottal pressure, and the transglottal pressure subsequently decreased. The combined effect of these two
activities was to lower F0 at vowel offset. No clear agerelated differences were associated with F0 offset. As
such, it would appear that the lowering in F0 at vowel
offset is not a developmental phenomenon and may simply reflect an acoustic consequence of producing a voiceless obstruent preceded by a vowel.

F0 Variability
Considerable F0 variability existed across age groups
and phrases. A consistent finding among groups was an
increase in semitone variability near voicing offset and
high semitone variability at voicing onset. A similar
pattern of variability for young and elderly adults was
reported by Watson (1998). However, it is important to
note that the variability data reported in Figure 2 are
normalized to the cycle furthest from the obstruent.
Because F0 will stray over time (Crystal, 1969), the
454

vocal cycles furthest from the normalized cycle will show
greater average differences from the normalized point.
A better indicator of F0 variability is derived from the
average F0 values reported in Tables 1 and 2. The largest F0 variability for F0 onset and F0 offset samples was
generally found for the 4-year-olds, with 21-year-olds
showing the least variability. There appeared to be no
change in F0 variability from one vocal cycle to the next.
It is noteworthy that, although age-related changes were
found for only one of the F0 measures (i.e., F0 onset), the
variability surrounding both F0 onset and F0 offset was
highest among 4-year-olds, with less variability shown
among older children and adults. The finding of high
variability in the youngest children supports previous
developmental studies examining acoustic features of
speech (e.g., Kent, 1976; Smith, 1978) and underscores
that both F0 measures are less stable in children than
in adults.

Sex Effects
Although the original analyses found an age-related
difference for F0 onset, the results of the supplemental
analyses found that adult females demonstrated a higher
F0 at voicing onset than did adult males. Therefore the
developmental effect observed for F0 onset may have
been driven in part by the high F0 onset behavior found
in adult females. In addition, adult females and males
were also found to differ in their F0 offset behavior. Interestingly, there are no prior reports of a sex difference
in F0 onset and F0 offset. Some evidence for a sex-linked
difference in voicing behavior is found for VOT (Ryalls,
Zipprer, & Baldauff, 1997; Swartz, 1992; Whiteside &
Irving, 1997). The results from these studies suggest
that sociophonetic factors are likely to account for the
sex difference, with females using more carefully articulated speech and, in particular, adopting this speaking
style in experimental situations (Byrd, 1994). The experimental design and methods used for the present
study were meant to control for sex rather than to assess sexual differences. However, in light of these additional findings, it would be worthwhile to examine a
larger sample of men and women to clarify whether a
sex difference exists.

Conclusion
What conclusions can be drawn from the present
findings for F0 onset and F0 offset? Definitive patterns
of laryngeal behavior occur during the moments immediately preceding and following voiceless obstruent production. In addition, it appears that children as young
as 4 years old demonstrate both phonetically governed
voicing and devoicing behavior. A logical extension of
the present work would be to evaluate phonetically

governed (de)voicing behavior in a wider range of phonetic environments to better understand the phenomenon in normal speakers. We are also intrigued by the
potential clinical information these behaviors may provide in the examination of speech-disordered individuals. If a specific articulatory event is disordered (e.g.,
fricative production), are the laryngeal adjustments surrounding this event likewise disordered? Additional
study of F0 onset and F0 offset should provide further insight into the emergence and mastery of articulatory
maneuvers in a child's attainment of mature speech patterns, as well as further delineating adult female and male
vocal behavior.
