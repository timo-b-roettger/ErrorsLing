The study investigated the processing of Russian gender and number
agreement by native (n = 36) and nonnative (n = 36) participants
using a visual lexical decision task with priming. The design included
a baseline condition that helped dissociate the underlying components of priming (facilitation and inhibition). The results showed no
differences in the magnitude of priming between native and nonnative participants, and between gender and number agreement. However, whereas the priming effect in native participants consisted of
both facilitation and inhibition, in second language (L2) learners it
was characterized by facilitation in the absence of inhibition. Furthermore, the nonnative processing failed to demonstrate the default
form bias, which optimized gender and number processing in native

proficient L2 learners are able to demonstrate nativelike priming effects,
their processing of morphosyntactic information engages different
processing mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION
It has long been recognized that learning the grammar of a new language is
a tall order for many people. Grammar, which "governs even kings and
with high hands makes them obey its laws" (Moliere, 2013: act 2, sc. 6),
does not have complete power over second language (L2) learners,
especially those who began to learn their L2 after the critical period
(DeKeyser, 2000; DeKeyser, 2013; DeKeyser & Larsen-Hall, 2005). These
learners tend to experience difficulties with such aspects of a L2 as
inflectional morphology in both production and comprehension, even
at advanced levels of proficiency (e.g., Ayoun, 2007; Clahsen & Felser,
2006a, 2006b; Clahsen, Felser, Neubauer, Sato, & Silva, 2010; DeKeyser,
2013; DeKeyser & Prieto Botana, 2014; Gor & Cook, 2010; Gor & Jackson,
2013; Gruter, Lew-Williams, & Fernald, 2012; Jiang, 2004, 2007; Jiang,
Novokshanova, Masuda, & Wang, 2011; White, Valenzuela, KozlowskaMacgregor, & Leung 2004), and appear to have particular difficulties
with grammatical agreement.
The computation of agreement rules plays a central role in language
comprehension, especially in richly inflected languages. When processing agreement, native speakers demonstrate congruency effects
evidenced in shorter reaction latencies when syntactic items agree in
gender or number and incongruency effects when items have incorrect
agreement (Gunter, Friederici, & Schriefers, 2000; Gurjanov, Lukatela,
Lukatela, Savic, & Turvey, 1985; Gurjanov, Lukatela, Moskovljevic, Savic, &
Turvey, 1985; Lukatela, Kostic, Feldman, & Turvey, 1983; Lukatela, Kostic,
Todorovic, Carello, & Turvey 1987; Vainio, Hyona, & Pajunen, 2003).
L2 learners, in contrast, have demonstrated reduced or no sensitivity
to agreement markers and difficulties in establishing agreement dependencies in processing (Blom, Polienska, & Weerman, 2008; Chen,
Shu, Liu, Zhao, & Li, 2007; Clahsen & Felser, 2006b; Franceschina, 2005;
Guillelmon & Grosjean, 2001; Jiang et al., 2011; Keating, 2009; McCarthy,
2008; Montrul, Foote, & Perpinan, 2008; Montrul, de la Fuente, Davidson, &
Foote, 2013; Morgan-Short, Sanz, Steinhauer, & Ullman, 2010; Unsworth,
2008).
L2 learners' lack of sensitivity to agreement violations has been
attributed to their age of acquisition and inability to activate a syntactic

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

mechanism that checks gender agreement (Guillelmon & Grosjean, 2001),
the engagement of different cognitive mechanisms (Clahsen & Felser,
2006a; DeKeyser, 2009, 2013), and the selective integration of linguistic
knowledge in late L2 acquisition (Jiang, 2007). Other factors include
language proficiency and working memory (Sagarra & Herschensohn,
2010), the similarity of linguistic structures in the L1 and L2 (Chen
et al., 2007; Hawkins & Casillas, 2008; Jiang et al., 2011; Sabourin, 2003;
Tokowicz & MacWhinney, 2005), and the transparency of morphophonological cues (Foote, 2014, 2015). The role of domain-general factors--
such as low L2 working memory capacity, poor decoding, and/or slower
L2 processing speed (McDonald, 2000, 2006; McDonald & Roussel, 2010)--
has also been pointed out. However, despite a plethora of studies demonstrating L1-L2 processing differences, the nature of L2 difficulties and
the relative importance and interaction of factors modulating native and
nonnative sensitivity to morphosyntactic information in online processing remain unclear.
Different views also exist regarding whether gender and number are
represented and processed similarly or differently. Some researchers
propose that gender, similar to number, projects its own syntactic phrase
and that, accordingly, gender and number processing should not be
different (Picallo, 1991). This view is supported by findings of similar
processing for gender and number violations in monolingual (Lukatela
et al., 1983; Lukatela et al., 1987) and bilingual (Aleman Banon, 2012;
Dowens, Guoc, Guoc, Barber, & Carreiras, 2011; Sagarra & Herschensohn,
2010, 2011) speakers. Others claim that grammatical gender is a steminherent feature of a noun's lexical representation that is stored as part
of each noun's grammatical description in the mental lexicon, in contrast to number, which is a morphosyntactic feature that combines with
the stem of the word and needs to be computed (Barber & Carreiras,
2005; Franceschina, 2001). Whereas a violation of number agreement
requires the processor to check the final evaluation stage of syntactic
processing, a gender agreement violation forces the processor to return
to the initial stage of lexical access to check if the right word has been
selected. Therefore, repair after gender agreement violation may be
cognitively more demanding than repair after number agreement violation (Dominguez, Cuetos, & Segui, 1999; Sicuro Correa, Almeida, &
Sobrino Porto, 2004). This view is supported by findings regarding delayed
latencies for gender disagreement as compared to number disagreement (Barber & Carreiras, 2003), greater event-related potential (ERP)
effects in gender disagreement in comparison with number disagreement (e.g., the last segment of the P600 effect was greater for gender
than for number violations in Barber & Carreiras, 2005), and stronger
brain responses to gender disagreement than to number disagreement,
as is evident in the increase of P600 amplitude in violations realized at a
greater distance between agreeing elements (O'Rourke & Van Petten, 2011)

in native speakers. Nonnative speakers have also demonstrated greater
accuracy on number agreement than gender agreement and faster computation of number agreement violations than gender agreement violations (Dowens et al., 2011; Franceschina, 2001; Sagarra & Herschensohn,
2013; White et al., 2004). However, evidence in support of differences
between gender and number agreement processing in the L1 and L2
remains inconclusive. The picture becomes more intricate when models
of gender versus number processing are extended to morphologically complex languages, such as Russian, in which other factors may
impact morphological processing in the L2 differently than in the L1.
One such factor examined in this article is the default status of masculine gender and singular number in Russian. The default/nondefault
distinction parallels the unmarked/marked relations established in
research on markedness. The notion of markedness was first proposed
by Nikolai Trubetzkoy and Roman Jakobson in the 1930s as a means of
characterizing binary oppositions in phonology; was extended to other
areas, such as morphology, syntax, and semantics; and was later adopted
in L2 research to predict areas of L2 difficulty (Eckman, 1977; Eckman,
Moravcsik, & Wirth, 1986). Since then, research has shown that markedness plays a role in both L1 and L2 acquisition and processing of
morphology. Because unmarked classes are more frequent and less
morphologically marked, they tend to be acquired earlier and produced
more accurately (Eckman et al., 1986; Gordishevsky & Schaeffer, 2008;
Gvozdev, 1961; Kempe, Brooks, Mironova, & Fedorova, 2003; Popova,
1973), to be more stable than marked classes (Greenberg, 1966; Gurel,
2004), and to require less processing effort (Deutsch & Bentin, 2001).
Additionally, unmarked forms are used as the default when a grammatical category is unknown or ambiguous (Bonvillain, 2003). In most
languages, including Russian, the default gender is masculine and the
default number is singular (Corbett, 1991). Accordingly, in this article
the terms default and unmarked are used interchangeably to refer to
masculine and singular nouns, and the terms nondefault and marked are
used to refer to feminine and plural nouns.
Akhutina and colleagues (2001) conducted a morphological priming
study targeting gender agreement in two-word phrases in congruent,
incongruent, and baseline (neutral) contexts. They posited that (a)
because nouns in default classes are more likely to occur, their nonoccurrence leads to inhibition, whereas their occurrence does not facilitate them beyond the baseline expectation and (b) because nouns in
nondefault classes are less likely to occur, their occurrence leads to
facilitation, whereas their nonoccurrence does not inhibit them beyond
the baseline. In their study examining the differences in performance
between healthy and aphasic Russian listeners, the markedness effect
found in healthy listeners included (a) inhibition (longer reaction times to
violations in comparison to neutral primes) exhibited only for masculine

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

101

singular nouns (based on the listener's default form bias), (b) facilitation
(shorter reaction times to correct agreement in comparison to the baseline) exhibited only for neuter nouns (based on the low probability of
these nouns), and (c) both facilitation and inhibition for feminine nouns
(reflecting their nondefault status and the fact that feminine nouns are
a very large class, even though they are less frequently used than the
masculine nouns).1
Remarkably, the markedness effect (or the role of the default) described
previously was not found in aphasic patients (Akhutina et al., 2001),
suggesting that its absence may be a general symptom in Russian users
with suboptimal language abilities. Extending this hypothesis to L2
learners of Russian in order to examine L1-L2 differences in the processing of grammatical agreement from the point of view of the presence/
absence of the markedness effect in a language with a complex inflectional morphology, such as Russian, is a promising new avenue for
research.
In view of the literature discussed previously, the main purpose of the
study was to examine L2 processing of morphosyntactic information in
agreement dependencies. The study aimed to determine whether gender
and number are processed similarly in L1 and L2 Russian and whether
highly proficient L2 speakers can gain nativelike strategies for processing both gender (not instantiated in their L1) and number (instantiated
in their L1). The third aim was to investigate whether agreement processing is modulated by the default/nondefault status of masculine/
feminine and singular/plural noun classes.
The choice of the method was guided by research methods used in
cognitive psychology and was motivated by the following findings:
(a) the presence of a predictive modifier speeds processing for gender/
number agreement relative to an unpredictive modifier, (b) congruency
in agreement speeds up processing, and (c) incongruency slows it down
(Gunter et al., 2000; Gurjanov, Lukatela, Lukatela, et al., 1985; Gurjanov,
Lukatela, Moskovljevic, 1985; Lukatela et al., 1983; Lukatela et al., 1987;
Vainio et al., 2003). This "priming effect," widely demonstrated in semantic and grammatical contexts (see Neely, 1991, and Nicol, 1996, for reviews
of semantic and syntactic priming, respectively), is quantified by
subtracting reaction times (RTs) for targets in congruent/grammatical
contexts from RTs for targets in incongruent/ungrammatical contexts.
A methodological problem with this comparison is that one cannot
determine whether congruent/grammatical primes facilitate performance,
whether incongruent/ungrammatical primes inhibit performance, or
whether both effects are present (see Posner & Snyder, 1975). To determine the relative contributions of such facilitatory and inhibitory effects
to priming, a baseline condition is needed, with neutral primes that are
neither semantically nor grammatically related, and that are unrelated to
the target (such as the letter string xxxx) (Neely, 1991). Facilitation is

then quantified as the difference between the neutral condition and
the congruent/grammatical condition, and inhibition is quantified as
the difference between the neutral prime condition and the unrelated/
ungrammatical prime condition (Posner & Snyder, 1975). Furthermore,
an examination of priming effects can help determine the extent to
which a particular underlying processing mechanism contributes to
the observed priming effects. For example, whereas the presence of
facilitatory effects without inhibition in congruent contexts and at short
stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) characterizes automatic processing,
the presence of both facilitation and inhibition at longer SOAs characterizes controlled processes of expectation and rechecking in congruent
and incongruent contexts, respectively (Neely, 1991; Neely & Keefy, 1989;
Posner & Snyder, 1975).
Few studies so far have used a neutral prime condition in L2 research.
Two studies investigated whether early and late L2 learners can make use
of gender cues in spoken-word recognition tasks; they have obtained
conflicting results. Guillelmon and Grosjean (2001) found that EnglishFrench late bilinguals did not show any sensitivity to gender marking
either in grammatical or in ungrammatical contexts, and Foote (2014)
demonstrated that whereas English-Spanish late bilinguals showed
no facilitatory effects in the congruent condition, they were able to make
use of incongruent gender cues in a nativelike manner. Another study by
Hu and Jiang (2011) used a crossmodal priming task to examine semantic integration of words at the sentence level in listening comprehension. The findings for L1 participants were consistent with previous
research using the neutral baseline and showed facilitatory effects in
the congruent condition and inhibitory effects in the incongruent condition. However, the L2 participants in the study showed only facilitation in the absence of inhibition, thus demonstrating their inability
to integrate semantic information effectively and efficiently in listening
comprehension.
In order to compare native and nonnative processing of morphosyntactic information, the present study employed a lexical decision task (LDT)
within a priming paradigm and examined L1 and L2 priming patterns in
noun-adjective (NA) agreement that involves establishing a link between
the gender and number of the noun head and the adjective (e.g., prostoj,
kozjol "simple-MASC-SG, goat-MASC-SG"  [NP prostoj kozjol]; see the
Appendix for an overview of the Russian gender and number system).
By using a neutral prime, we were able to measure the costs (inhibition)
and benefits (facilitation) of priming and to isolate the contribution of
underlying strategic mechanisms of prediction and rechecking. Together
with an examination of the role of markedness (default/nondefault status),
our analysis of mechanisms underlying written-word processing constitutes a novel approach rarely used in second language acquisition
research that allows a nuanced comparison of L1-L2 priming patterns

and can lead to a better understanding of the nature of L2 processing
difficulties.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES
The study sought to answer the following questions:
1.Is gender agreement processed differently from number agreement in the L1
and in the L2?
2.Are L1 and L2 speakers similarly sensitive to agreement violations? Are there
any L1-L2 differences in priming components?
3.Are both native and nonnative participants sensitive to the markedness effect
(Akhutina et al., 2001) in processing gender and number agreement?
a.Is there an asymmetry between masculine and feminine noun targets in L1
and L2 agreement processing?
b.Is there an asymmetry between singular and plural noun targets in L1 and
L2 agreement processing?

In line with the literature discussed previously, the study made the
following predictions:
1.For both L1 and L2 participants, gender agreement violations will be more cognitively disruptive than number agreement violations. This will be evidenced in
greater "repair costs" for gender disagreement than for number disagreement,
leading to greater inhibition effects for gender than for number.
2.Both L1 and L2 participants will exhibit sensitivity to gender and number
agreement and agreement violations. Both L1 and L2 speakers will show
faster facilitation by processing targets in the grammatical (G) condition
than by targets in the neutral (N) condition, and they will exhibit slower inhibition by processing targets in the ungrammatical (U) condition than by targets in the neutral condition: G < N < U. These effects will reflect an engagement
of strategic expectations about the upcoming word based on morphosyntactic information on the prime and/or the costs of repair at the later rechecking
stage after the target becomes available.
3.Only native participants will exhibit the markedness effect (Akhutina et al.,
2001), or processing asymmetries between unmarked and marked noun targets:
a.Unmarked masculine and singular nouns, due to their default status, will show
robust inhibition in the U condition but no facilitation in the G condition.
b.Marked feminine and plural nouns, due to their nondefault status, will show
robust facilitation in the G condition, with or without robust inhibition in
the U condition.

The markedness effect will not appear in L2 participants.

METHOD
Participants
Anglophone participants residing in the United States who responded
to the study announcement were first prescreened using a Web-based
survey that covered, besides general information, their experience with
Russian. Those participants who had had extensive practice with Russian
either through study abroad, living and/or working in Russia, or attending
intensive summer programs in the United States continued with two
online proficiency tests, including a cloze test2 and a grammaticality
judgment task (GJT).3 Thirty-six participants whose scores on the tests
were above the previously determined cutoff points--60% on the cloze
test and more than 85% on the GJT (Romanova, 2013)--were invited to
take part in the experiment, along with 36 Russian-speaking participants
residing in Russia. Table 1 provides information on the participants'
demographics. The difference in age between the native speakers and
the L2 groups was not significant: t(35) = 3.57, p = .001. Results of both
groups' performance on the tests are presented in Table 2.

Materials and Design
The study employed a visual LDT with priming. Experimental stimuli consisted of prime/target word pairs representing NA dependencies within
syntactic phrase boundaries featuring gender and number agreement.
Targets included real words (n = 288) with a frequency range between
10 and 320 occurrences per million words (72.31, SD = 59.10, for feminine nouns; 76.87, SD = 58.52, for masculine/singular nouns; and 75.45,

tests between these and younger participants, the two older participants were assigned to different
testing groups.

SD = 61.90, for plural nouns). All the targets were in transparent disyllabic
citation forms (the nominative case). A one-way ANOVA conducted on
raw frequencies, with word category (feminine, masculine/singular, and
plural) as a factor, did not find significant differences (p = .524) among
the categories. The difference in word length among real feminine,
masculine/singular, and plural nouns, however, was shown to be significant: F(2, 514) = 59.89, p < .001, 2 = .189 (the mean length was 4.79,
SD = 0.73, for feminine nouns; 5.55, SD = 0.86, for masculine nouns; and
4.80, SD = 0.65, for plural nouns).4 A complete balance for the length in
letters could not be achieved because, in order to match disyllabic feminine and plural nouns used in the study (due to feminine and plural
markers), masculine nouns that have a zero ending and typically end in
a consonant also had to be disyllabic, and disyllabic masculine nouns,
on average, tend to be longer than feminine and plural nouns. Crucially,
this unavoidable slight imbalance may potentially create a bias (with
longer words taking longer to process) that goes in the opposite direction
of the expected effect--namely, that masculine nouns will be processed
faster than feminine nouns. Therefore, it does not pose a problem for
the interpretation of the findings. Thus great care was taken to maintain
the same average word length for each block of nouns in each priming
condition and across lists (5.1, SD = .9). A later analysis of mean RTs as
a function of word length showed that word length did not modulate RTs
in either group of participants. Word frequencies (including surface
frequency for plural nouns) were also carefully balanced across blocks
of feminine, masculine, and plural targets used in each prime condition.
A one-way ANOVA did not find significant differences in either word
length or lemma frequencies among the stimuli lists (p = .617).
As is common in LDTs reported in the literature (Neely, 1991), 50% of
the items employed in the study were nonwords (n = 298) based on real
nouns, drawn from other frequency ranges.5 To discourage participants
from responding before reading the entire nonword letter string, half
of the nonwords were derived from real word stems by adding inappropriate endings (Blumstein, Milberg, Dworetzky, Rosen, & Gershberg, 1991).
The remaining nonwords were created by randomly changing one or

106

Natalia Romanova and Kira Gor

two letters in real word stems that were not used in the experiments.
Care was taken to ensure that that the newly constructed nonwords
did not use low-frequency bigrams and orthographic or phonological
sequences that are illegal in Russian. No significant differences were
found between the length of the real and nonce words (p = .48). The list
of nonwords was checked by 10 native speakers of Russian who did not
participate in the study, with the aim of identifying any low-frequency
real words that could have inadvertently been created by manipulating
real words. As a result, 5.18% of the nonce words were replaced or
reconstructed.
In order to avoid any effects of the property of the prime, such as
lexical frequency and semantic congruence with the target, on response
latencies, different forms of the same prime adjective and an adverb with
the same stem were used instead of a variable set of primes in all trials
(Akhutina, Kurgansky, Polinsky, & Bates, 1999). This innovative approach
was first introduced in a study by Akhutina and colleagues, and in order
to produce comparable findings and capitalize on their design, we followed it closely. Thus the primes included (a) the masculine singular
adjective prostoj (simple); (b) the feminine singular adjective prostaja;
(c) the plural adjective prostyje; and (d) the adverb prosto, which was
identified as semantically and syntactically neutral (Akhutina et al., 1999;
Romanova, 2013). These primes were combined with targets to form
three experimental conditions: G, U, and N.
In order to establish priming environments that would encourage both
automatic and strategic processing mechanisms, the study manipulated
two different time intervals between the prime and the target (i.e., the
SOA)--250 and 1,000 ms--and two levels of grammaticality proportion
(GP), or a different number of prime-target pairs in the G and U conditions: one with a high GP of .7 (i.e., 70% of all the words formed grammatical prime-target pairs, and 30% formed ungrammatical pairs) and
one with a low GP of .3 (i.e., 30% of all the words formed grammatical
prime-target pairs, and 70% formed ungrammatical pairs) (Goodman,
McClelland, & Gibbs, 1981). Thus the complete priming battery for each
participant included four tests in the following experimental conditions:
low GP-SOA250, low GP-SOA1000, high GP-SOA250, and high GP-SOA1000
(for a full description of the experimental design, see Romanova, 2013).
The study also included 438 fillers appearing in noun-verb dependencies
(with 228 real words and 196 nonwords).
Because each participant had to encounter all the conditions without
seeing the same word/nonword twice, four master stimuli lists consisting of target real words, nonwords, and fillers were created and were
matched for the number of word categories used, for word frequency,
and for word length. As mentioned previously, no significant differences among the stimuli lists were found in either word length or lemma
frequencies. These lists were crossed with two GPs and two SOAs,

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

107

yielding 16 tests that were counterbalanced across participants. Note
that because the grammaticality proportion and the SOA manipulations
had a separate goal that is beyond the scope of the present study, and,
crucially, because each participant was exposed to both GPs and SOAs,
the two GPs and SOAs were collapsed together after checking that,
statistically, there were no interactions of these variables with the
priming condition (see the Data Analysis section). The total number of
stimuli was 1,024 and included 516 different real words and 494 different
nonwords.

Procedure
The investigations were carried out using a Web-deliverable version of
the DMDX software--developed by K. I. Forster and J. C. Forster (2003)
at the University of Arizona--that makes it possible to conduct experiments over the Internet (webDMDX).6 Each participant completed four
tests (two tests per day over a period of two days) in four experimental
conditions: low GP-SOA250, low GP-SOA1000, high GP-SOA250, and high
GP-SOA1000. Experimental stimuli in each test were presented via 12
blocks of 20-22 trials, depending on the list. After each block, participants were given an opportunity to take a break to avoid fatigue. A set
of 14 practice pairs preceded each experiment. The practice primes
included 14 prime-target pairs. The participants were instructed to take
a longer break between the two tests that were completed on the same
day. Each test took about 30 min to complete.
Each trial began with a preparatory cue ("+") in the center of the computer screen, visible for 500 ms. After a blank screen interval of 1,000 ms,
the first word--the prime--was displayed and remained visible for
the entire duration of the SOA (which, depending on the test, was either
250 or 1,000 ms). This continuous display of the prime was meant to
encourage participants to create expectancies (Balota, Black, & Cheney,
1992). The second word--the target--was then displayed and remained
on the screen for 4,000 ms or until the participant pressed the response
button. The next trial was activated 1,500 ms after the previous target
disappeared from the screen.
Participant reaction times, or the time from the presentation of the
target to pressing the response button, were recorded to the nearest
millisecond for correct responses to word and nonword targets. Errors
were also recorded for both yes responses to nonword targets and the
failure to recognize the word targets. The proportion of yes/no responses
was 50/50. Participants received direct feedback in the form of RTs
in milliseconds after each correct response. If their response was incorrect, they received negative feedback (Wrong) without RT information.

On completion of each test, an e-mail with the participant's data was sent
to the experimenter automatically.
After completing the main experiment, the L2 participants and a randomly selected subgroup of native participants (n = 10) also completed
a gender-monitoring task (GMT) and a number-monitoring task (NMT) to
assess the probability that the observed priming effects in L2 speakers
were influenced by incorrect gender or number assignment and to determine the ratio of errors made due to motor effects. The stimuli incorporated all the 516 real nouns used in the LDT experiment, with half of the
masculine singular nouns used in the NMT and the other half in the GMT.
Thus the GMT included 152 feminine nouns and 106 masculine singular
nouns, and the NMT included 152 plural nouns and 106 masculine singular nouns.
The two tasks were completed after the main experiment and involved
a dual-choice response mode. Stimuli were presented visually using
webDMDX. Participants were asked to decide as quickly as possible
whether the word they saw belonged to the feminine or masculine gender (in the GMT) or was singular or plural in number (in the NMT). They
pressed the right control button for masculine and singular nouns and
the left control button for feminine and plural nouns. They had 4 s to
respond. Six practice trials were presented before each task, and the
order of the stimuli was randomized for each participant. The presentation of the tasks was counterbalanced across participants.

Data Analysis
Mean RTs for each prime condition were calculated for each participant
for gender and number agreement. All the RTs more and less than two
standard deviations from the mean were removed from the data, as is
common in the literature. The data removed constituted .86% of all
responses for native participants and .99% for L2 participants. The internal consistency of the tests was assessed by computing the split-half
reliability for the RT data using the Spearman-Brown formula. Reliability
coefficients were very high overall, with r = 1.00 for native participants
and r = .99 for L2 speakers.
Accuracy of responses on gender/number assignment on the GMT
and NMT was also analyzed. The analysis revealed that L2 participants'
mean accuracy in both gender and number assignment was high: it was
97.3% (range: 90.1%-100%) on the GMT and 96.7% (range: 90.4%-100%)
on the NMT. The mean accuracy scores of the subgroup of Russian
participants (n = 10), who also performed the tests, were 96.9% (range:
90.2%-100%) on the GMT and 95.8% (range: 90.1%-100%) on the NMT.
Errors among native participants on the gender- and number-monitoring

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

tasks were obviously due to errors in motor responses and constituted
3.6% of all responses. Errors among L2 participants constituted 3%.
For reasons of consistency in data cleaning between the native speaker
and L2 groups and because of L2 participants' nativelike error rate on
the monitoring tasks, these words were not removed from the RT data.
To provide the measures of priming, mean RTs in the G condition
were compared with mean RTs in the U condition. Morphosyntactic
priming effects were defined as the RT difference between the U and G
conditions:
Priming effect = RTsungrammatical - RTsgrammatical

RTs for the G and U conditions were also compared with the N condition
to determine the facilitatory and inhibitory components of the observed
priming. Facilitation was defined as significantly shorter reaction times
in the G condition than in the N condition, and, conversely, significantly
longer reaction times in the U condition than in the neutral condition
represented inhibition:
Facilitation = RTsN > RTsG
Inhibition = RTsU > RTs N

The average response latencies and accuracy rates for the L1 and
L2 participant groups were submitted to a one-way ANOVA. Significant
differences between the two groups were found in RTs--F(1, 71) =
66.04, p < .001, 2 = .482--and in accuracy rates--F(1, 71) = 33.56,
p < .001, 2 = .321. Levene's Test of Homogeneity of Variances indicated that group comparisons failed to meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance: F(1, 71) = 3.11, p < .05, 2 = . 042, and F(1, 71) =
3.83, p < .05, 2 = .051. Accordingly, the L2 and L1 groups' data were not
compared directly, and their data for both mean RTs for correct responses
and priming effects were analyzed separately (Milberg, Blumstein, Katz,
Gershberg, & Brown, 1995). For both groups, repeated-measures ANOVAs
were used.
Because the purpose of the study was to examine the patterns of
priming for each grammatical category and the treatment of the default
(markedness relations) in native and nonnative participants, the data
were collapsed over the GP and SOA conditions to isolate and quantify
the variables of interest. This was done based on the absence of significant GP x SOA x priming condition interaction for either participant group, as shown in a three-way ANOVA with three within-subjects
factors--namely, SOA (250, 1000), grammaticality proportion (low GP,
high GP), and prime condition (G, N, or U) run on the RT data collapsed over the grammatical categories (L1: F[2, 70] = .55, p > .1, and
L2: F[2, 70] = 1.69, p > .1).

RESULTS
Table 3 shows mean RTs for both groups of participants for gender and
number agreement across the three priming conditions. To answer the
first two research questions, a two-way ANOVA with two within-subjects
factors--namely, grammatical category (Gender or Number) and prime
condition (G, N, or U)--was performed on the RT data separately for
each group of participants.
The results revealed a significant main effect of the grammatical category in both L1 (F1[1, 35] = 9.63, p < .001, 2 = .22; F2[1, 143] = 10.5, p = .001,
2 = .1) and L2 (F1[1, 35] = 29.33, p < . 001, 2 = .46; F2[1, 143] = 8.21, p = .005,
2 = .06) groups, a significant main effect of the prime condition in both
L1 (F1[2, 70] = 26.31, p < .001, 2 = .43; F2[2, 286] = 21.55, p < .001, 2 = .14)
and L2 (F1[2, 70] = 8.31, p < .001, 2 = .201; F2[2, 286] = 2.3, p = .05, 2 = .02)
groups, and no significant grammatical category x priming condition
interaction.

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement Dependencies
The main effect obtained for grammatical category suggests that, overall,
gender agreement dependencies were processed significantly faster
than number agreement dependencies by both native (8 ms, p = .009)
and L2 participants (25 ms, p < .001) (Table 3). However, the lack of
interaction between grammatical category and priming condition--
evident in similarly robust priming effects, including facilitation and
inhibition, in both gender and number agreement in both groups of

Sensitivity to Morphosyntactic Information
The main effect of the priming condition for each group of participants
found by the two-way ANOVA described previously reflects similar
processing patterns of targets in the G, U, and N conditions. Although
L2 participants responded to the targets more slowly than L1 participants did (Table 3), their sensitivity to morphosyntactic information
was nativelike: they responded to the nouns in the ungrammatical
condition significantly more slowly than they responded to the nouns
in the grammatical condition, demonstrating robust priming effects
(Table 4).
However, further examination of priming components using planned
within-subjects contrasts revealed L1-L2 differences for both types of
agreement. In contrast to priming in the L1, characterized by similarly
robust facilitation and inhibition, L2 priming consisted mostly of facilitation in the absence of inhibition. The observed differences, therefore,
point to different underlying mechanisms in L1 and L2 processing.
Whereas native participants relied on both strategic expectations and
rechecking mechanisms, L2 participants seemed to rely more on expectancy, which helped them process targets in the grammatical condition
faster than targets in the neutral condition and did not demonstrate the
use of rechecking after both words were accessed.

Priming Patterns and the Role of Markedness
In order to further compare L1 and L2 priming patterns, we examined
the processing of each grammatical category from the perspective of
markedness. A series of 2 x 3 within-subjects ANOVAs, with gender
(Masculine or Feminine) and priming condition (G, U, or N) and number
(Singular or Plural) and priming condition (G, U, or N) as factors, were
conducted on the RT data for each grammatical category and each
group of participants. The results are discussed first for gender and
then for number.
Processing of Masculine and Feminine Nouns. In native participants,
the average 4-ms difference between the overall RTs for masculine and
feminine nouns was not significant: no main effect of noun gender was
found (F1[1, 35] = 1.7, p > .1; F2[1, 85] = 1.4, p > .1), suggesting that native
speakers did not display a general advantage (independent of context)
for unmarked masculine nouns (Table 5). The main effect of the priming
condition, on the other hand, was found to be significant (F1[2, 70] =
20.24, p < .001; F2[2, 170] = 11.2, p < .001). It reflected large differences
among the RTs in the G, U, and N conditions. The gender x priming condition interaction was found to be significant by subjects (F1[2, 70] =
4.03, p = .028) but not by items (F2[2, 170] = 1.1, p = .3), suggesting the
existence of differences in the native priming patterns between unmarked
masculine nouns and marked feminine nouns.
Planned within-subject contrasts for each gender showed significant
"cumulative" priming effects for both masculine (40 ms, F[1, 35] = 39.02,
p < .001) and feminine (24 ms, F[1, 35] = 27.58, p < .001) nouns. However,
the priming in unmarked masculine nouns came entirely from significant

inhibition (30 ms, F[1, 35] = 19.37, p < .001; facilitation of 10 ms was not
significant), whereas priming in marked feminine nouns was dominated
by significant facilitation (15 ms, F[1, 35] = 4.4, p = .04; inhibition of 9 ms
did not reach significance).
Figure 1 illustrates this interaction by using facilitation and inhibition
scores for each gender. As seen in the figure, native processing of masculine nouns in the grammatical condition did not rely on facilitation
indicative of the strategic mechanism of prediction (due to their default
status). At the same time, their inhibition in the ungrammatical condition reflected the mechanism of rechecking after both the prime and the
target became available. In contrast, marked feminine nouns, due to their
nondefault status, showed robust facilitation in the G condition and
insignificant inhibition in the U condition.
The RT means for the L2 group are reported in Table 5. Similar to the
native participants, the L2 participants displayed the main effect of the
priming condition (F1[2, 70] = 6.69, p = .002; F2[2, 170] = 4.05, p = .048)
and no main effect of gender (F1[1, 35] = 2.6, p > .1; F2[1, 85] = 1.9, p > .1).
In contrast to the results for native speakers, the interaction between
priming condition and gender in the L2 group was not significant both
by subjects and by items (F1[2, 70] = .568, p > .1; F2[2, 170] = .31, p > .5),
suggesting no differences between unmarked masculine nouns and marked
feminine nouns in L2 processing.

Planned within-subject contrasts conducted for the masculine and
feminine nouns in the L2 group showed that significant priming effects
(18 ms for the masculine nouns, F[1, 35] = 4.1, p = .05, and 31 ms for the
feminine nouns, F[1, 35] = 10.81, p = .002) consisted of insignificant facilitation for unmarked masculine nouns (14 ms, n.s.) in the absence of
inhibition and (barely) significant facilitation of marked feminine nouns
(22 ms, F[1, 35] = 3.21, p = .052) in the presence of insignificant inhibition (9 ms) (Figure 2). When processing agreement dependencies, the
L2 participants seemed to rely on the mechanism of prediction rather than
on rechecking. For masculine nouns, the facilitatory effect--although
insignificant, possibly due to the lack of power--was still observed;
for feminine nouns, it was significant.
In summary, our in-depth analysis of priming patterns in L1 and L2
processing of marked versus unmarked gender classes revealed subtle
differences between L1-L2 processing that were not obvious when the
analysis focused only on the priming effect (the difference between the
RTs in the grammatical and ungrammatical conditions) and not on its
components. In concert with the predictions of the markedness effect
hypothesis, the study found an asymmetry between genders in L1
agreement processing. This asymmetry was reflected in finding robust
inhibition for unmarked masculine noun targets in the ungrammatical
condition and no facilitation in the grammatical condition, and in finding

and feminine (fem) nouns.

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

115

robust facilitation of marked feminine nouns in the grammatical condition along with insignificant inhibition in the ungrammatical condition.
In contrast, the L2 participants did not show evidence of gender asymmetry, as reflected in their nonrecognition of the default status of masculine nouns. This happened despite their nativelike ability to use
morphosyntactic information in the prime for predicting the form of
the target, which facilitated access of these targets in the grammatical
condition.
Processing of Singular and Plural Nouns. Table 6 shows native and L2
participants' mean RTs for number agreement. Native speakers responded
faster to singular than to plural nouns, and the difference was significant, as revealed by the main effect of number (23 ms; F1[1, 35] = 28.31,
p < .001; F2[1, 85] = 29.55, p < .001). Within-subjects tests also yielded a
significant main effect of the priming condition (overall average size of
priming: 29 ms; F1[2, 70] = 16.55, p < .001; F2[2, 170] = 8.08, p < .01), but
the number x priming condition interaction did not reach significance
either by subjects or by items (p > .1).
Planned within-subject contrasts conducted separately for the marked
plural and unmarked singular number classes indicated that although the
priming was significant for both singular (40 ms, F[1, 35] = 27.32, p < .001)
and plural (24 ms, F[1, 35] = 11.7, p = .002) nouns, in unmarked singular
nouns the priming was characterized, as expected, almost entirely by
significant inhibition (23 ms, F[1, 35] = 19.85, p < .001), and the facilitatory
effect of 10 ms was not significant. In contrast, the priming in marked
plural nouns consisted of significant facilitation (17 ms, F[1, 35] = 3.9,
p = .05), with almost no inhibition (7 ms, p > .1) (see Figure 3). Therefore,
even though the interaction effect was not found to be significant for overall priming, a detailed analysis of the components of priming revealed

significant differences between marked and unmarked numbers in L1
processing.
A within-subjects ANOVA performed on L2 data also yielded a large,
significant main effect of number (F1[1, 35] = 80.4, p < .001; F2[1, 35] = 22.4,
p < .001), a smaller but significant main effect of the priming condition
(F1[2, 70] = 4.48, p = .015; F2[2, 170] = 5.8, p = .019), but no significant
interaction between the priming condition and number (F1[2, 70] = 1.59,
p > .1; F2[2, 170] = 1.9, p > .1). The significant main effect of number is
reflected in overall longer (64 ms) RTs to marked plural nouns than to
unmarked singular nouns (Table 6).
As shown in Figure 4, priming in singular nouns was small in magnitude
(8 ms) and, as revealed by planned within-subjects contrasts, insignificant, and so were the components of priming, facilitation (14 ms), and
reverse inhibition (i.e., facilitation in which inhibition was expected)
(-5 ms). Plural nouns, on the other hand, showed significant priming
(36 ms, F[1, 35] = 8.9, p = .005), which was represented by significant
facilitation (36 ms, F[1, 35] = 4.86, p = .034) in the absence of inhibition.
In summary, a detailed analysis of L1-L2 priming patterns in number
agreement from the perspective of markedness found an asymmetry
between numbers in L1, but not in L2, processing. As expected, priming
in unmarked singular targets in the L1 group consisted of inhibition
(in the absence of facilitation), whereas priming in marked plural targets

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

117

Figure 4. Components of priming in the L2 (ms) for singular and

consisted of facilitation (in the absence of inhibition). Conversely,
L2 participants did not record inhibition of unmarked singulars but showed
facilitation for both marked plural and unmarked singular nouns in the
grammatical condition, thereby demonstrating their nativelike ability to
predict the form of the target based on the morphosyntactic information
encoded in the prime.
Thus the findings of the study show that the markedness effect
was not fully realized in L2 processing. Furthermore, they indicate
that whereas L1 participants employed both strategic prediction and
rechecking depending on the default/nondefault status of gender or
number, L2 speakers, even at advanced levels of proficiency, mostly
relied on prediction and did not invoke rechecking mechanisms at later
stages of lexical access.
DISCUSSION
The present study investigated the processing of gender and number
agreement in L1 and highly proficient L2 participants and, using a baseline condition, dissociated the contribution of the underlying mechanisms
of priming (facilitation and inhibition) that are typically confounded

118

Natalia Romanova and Kira Gor

in the traditional analysis. We claim that to see the "devil," or L1 and
L2 processing differences, researchers need to examine the "details,"
or the priming components. The results are discussed in the order of the
hypotheses presented earlier.

Gender and Number Processing
The first hypothesis predicted that gender agreement violations would
be more disruptive than number agreement violations for both native
and L2 participants. The main effect obtained for grammatical category
reflected faster overall RTs for gender agreement than for number
agreement, which can be attributed to the morphological decomposition
effect observed in plural nouns, that is, early obligatory activation of the
segmentation of morphologically complex plural nouns into morphemesized units during online processing (Kazanina, Dukova-Zheleva, Geber,
Kharlamov, & Tonciulescu, 2008). However, the examination of priming
and priming components for each grammatical category did not reveal
differences in the priming patterns for gender and number agreement.
The finding of equally robust facilitation and inhibition for both gender
and number in the L1 does not support the view that repair after gender
agreement violation is cognitively more complex than repair after number
agreement violation (Dominguez et al., 1999; Sicuro Correa et al., 2004).
Furthermore, the finding of robust facilitation without inhibition in L2
priming for both gender and number agreement contrasts with the view
that L2 gender agreement is more difficult to acquire and process than
number agreement, due to L1 transfer (Hawkins & Casillas, 2008; Hopp,
2010; Sabourin, 2003) or L1-L2 morphological incongruency (Jiang et al.,
2011) in cases in which participants' L1 does not instantiate gender but
instantiates number. This finding is in line with previous monolingual
(Lukatela et al., 1987) and bilingual (Aleman Banon, 2012; Dowens et al.,
2011; Sagarra & Herschensohn, 2011) studies and is consistent with
Picallo's view (1991) that number and gender may be represented and
processed similarly.

Native versus L2 Processing
It was hypothesized that L1 and highly proficient L2 participants
would exhibit similar sensitivity to agreement violations. The findings,
again, are not straightforward. Whereas the L2 participants showed
nativelike performance, evident in robust priming for both gender and
number agreement, an analysis of the priming components revealed

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

119

L1-L2 processing differences. In contrast to the native participants'
priming patterns for gender and number that consisted of both facilitation and inhibition, the L2 priming for both gender and number was
characterized by facilitation in the absence of inhibition. In particular,
both the L1 and L2 participants showed facilitation of lexical access in
grammatical conditions. At the same time, the L1 participants showed
inhibition in ungrammatical conditions with agreement violations,
whereas the L2 participants processed the noun targets in the ungrammatical condition similarly to the baseline.
Although the design of the experiment--namely, the use of the same
stem with different inflections as the prime--encouraged the engagement
of both strategic processing mechanisms of building expectancies and
reevaluation of the input, L2 participants in our study favored prediction
over rechecking. The finding of L2 facilitation of lexical access in grammatical contexts indicates that L2 users, similarly to native speakers,
deploy the mechanism of creating expectancies as they rely on morphosyntactic cues on the prime to predict the gender/number of the target.
However, the lack of inhibition in ungrammatical contexts suggests that,
in contrast to native speakers, they do not deploy the mechanism of
rechecking for coherence after lexical access (Neely, 1991).
The findings are in contrast to previous studies that either did not
observe the use of predictive strategies in the L2 or observed the opposite
pattern, that is, inhibition (e.g., Foote, 2014; Gruter et al., 2012; Guillelmon &
Grosjean, 2001; Montrul, Davidson, de la Fuente, & Foote, 2014). A possible
explanation for these contrasting results may be the use of different
methods: whereas a visual LDT, as used in the current study, reflects the
operation of predictive strategies, the spoken-word recognition tasks
used in previous research reflect postlexical rechecking (Foote, 2014;
Montrul et al., 2014). Besides, one robust finding documented in these
studies is that gender assignment remains a problem even for advanced
L2 speakers (e.g., Gruter et al., 2012), and, therefore, L2 familiarity with
the items may drive the strength of predictive strategies. Crucially, none
of the previous studies have considered the asymmetry in the processing of the unmarked versus marked gender and number, and it may be
that the lack of a default bias in L2 Russian, in combination with context
effects, affected the overreliance on predictive strategies in the L2
observed in the current study.
Similar to our findings, in previous studies high levels of facilitation
with reduced or no inhibition were reported for language users affected
by Parkinson's disease (PD); these participants benefited from semantic cues (such as the primes) more than controls, possibly due to
their difficulties retrieving information from semantic memory (Spicer,
Brown, & Gorell, 1994).7 An alternative view attributes large facilitation
in the absence of inhibition to difficulties in suppressing irrelevant information or in counteracting strong initial facilitation, as is found in PD

120

patients (Mari-Beffa, Hayes, Machado, & Hindle, 2005) or in less skilled
L1 readers and older adults (Gernsbacher & Faust, 1991). According to
Mari-Beffa et al. (2005), the prime word does not need to be attended to
in order for the target to show hyperpriming, and any displayed word
would be automatically processed without being affected by an inhibitory
control mechanism. As a result of enhanced or prolonged uninhibited
activation of previously presented information, PD patients responded
faster than controls to targets in related trials. Gernsbacher (1997), on
the other hand, distinguished between suppression--that is, the attenuation or reduction of unwanted activation--and inhibition--that is, the
blocking of unwanted activation. Whereas suppression can only occur
once the information has been activated, inhibition prevents activation
in the first place. As shown in Gernsbacher and Faust (1991), less skilled
adult L1 comprehenders were less able to suppress or to decrease the
activation of the contextually inappropriate meanings and incorrect
forms of homophones, and they were less able to suppress words while
viewing pictures or to suppress pictures while reading words.
To the best of our knowledge, the only study that reported a similar
pattern of facilitation in the absence of inhibition in the SLA literature
was a crossmodal priming study by Hu and Jiang (2011) that examined
how L2 comprehenders achieve semantic integration at the sentence
level. They, too, attributed the lack of an inhibition effect in the L2 either
to nonnative speakers' inability to preactivate a cohort of possible sentence endings quickly enough to access meaning or to their inability
"to suppress the (unwanted) most predictable ending of a sentence,
which blocks the neutral ending from being considered a coherent
part of a sentence" (p. 213), as is typical for less skilled comprehenders
(Gernsbacher, 1997; Gernsbacher & Faust, 1991).
It remains an open question whether the large facilitatory effects for
gender and number (especially for the unmarked categories) in the
absence of inhibition in the nonnative participants in our study could
be explained by their reliance on the prediction mechanism at the
expense of postlexical rechecking, by their morphosyntactic information retrieval difficulties, or by their difficulties with suppressing or
inhibiting inappropriate morphosyntactic information. It also remains
unclear whether this priming pattern characterizes other types of representations in L2 and what factors (e.g., working memory capacity and
language proficiency) can modulate this phenomenon.

The Markedness Effect: The Role of the Default Category
According to the third hypothesis, only native participants would exhibit
the markedness effect (Akhutina et al., 2001), displaying asymmetries

Processing of Gender and Number Agreement in Russian

121

between marked feminine and unmarked masculine nouns and between
marked plural and unmarked singular nouns. The hypothesis was confirmed. The native participants recorded predicted processing asymmetries between the two genders and numbers, with unmarked targets
showing stronger inhibition in the ungrammatical contexts and marked
targets showing stronger facilitation in the grammatical contexts. In contrast, the nonnative participants did not record inhibition of unmarked
targets in the ungrammatical condition, but they did show facilitation of
both marked and unmarked targets in the grammatical condition.
The findings suggest that highly proficient L2 participants, despite
showing nativelike sensitivity to grammatical contexts, failed to demonstrate the markedness effect, which was robust in native processing.
This result parallels the findings for gender priming in Akhutina and
colleagues' study (2001), which showed differences in the priming patterns between healthy and aphasic patients.
Akhutina and colleagues explained the markedness effect by evoking
Elman's (1990) account of a recurrent network model of grammatical
processing. According to Elman, lexical items are defined by their positions within a high-dimensional lexical space, and their similarity is
defined by the relative distance among them. Lexical access involves
movement into the correct position within this space. An unmarked
region (including the unmarked gender and number) would be relatively
central along one or more dimensions from which the largest number of
moves could be made in the shortest time. Using a tennis court metaphor,
Akhutina and colleagues argued that, similar to a good tennis player
who "moves back to center court as quickly as possible after each
move" (2001; p. 311), a competent language user--in our case, a native
speaker--processes targets from this unmarked, default position.8
When the grammatical form of the upcoming target can be predicted
from the morphosyntactic cues on the prime, the processor can move
closer to or further away from the region where the target will occur.
In the absence of this information (e.g., at the beginning of a new trial),
the processor moves back into a more central position to maximize processing efficiency. In our study, congruent contexts (masculine/singular
adjective primes) did not facilitate the upcoming unmarked targets
in the L1 more than the baseline (prosto condition), as they provided no
gender- or number-relevant information beyond what was expected
based on the default status of the prime. By contrast, incongruent contexts (feminine/plural adjective primes) produced larger inhibition for
masculine/singular targets (unmarked, default forms) than for feminine/
plural targets (marked, nondefault forms). As for the marked feminine/
plural targets, the markedness effect was demonstrated in the form of
facilitation, because the time required for recognizing a feminine or
a plural noun was reduced by gender- or number-congruent information.
Because Russian speakers expect the default/unmarked gender or number

122

Natalia Romanova and Kira Gor

when processing language, the inhibitory effects on the marked targets
in incongruent conditions were smaller.
Akhutina and colleagues further argued that less competent language
users--in our case, L2 participants--can use the grammatical context
to assist them in lexical identification (i.e., they can show priming and
facilitation) but "fail to move back toward a maximally efficient central
position" (Akhutina et al., 2001, p. 320). This lack of default form bias, which
optimizes the efficiency of native language processing, may be concealed
in highly proficient L2 users by their seemingly nativelike sensitivity to
context--the ability to use morphosyntactic cues to predict the form of
the upcoming word, evidenced in strong facilitation of both marked and
unmarked targets. Yet, as discussed previously, this finding may also
reflect their processing weakness--either an inability to preactivate and
retrieve morphosyntactic information from memory (Spicer et al., 1994)
or an inability to inhibit or suppress previously activated information
(Gernsbacher, 1997; Gernsbacher & Faust, 1991; Mari-Beffa et al., 2005).
The role of morphological markedness has been demonstrated in
both native and L2 processing before. For example, native speakers
of Hebrew showed greater sensitivity (reflected by a larger P600) to
subject-verb agreement violations for marked plural verbs compared to
unmarked singulars (Deutsch & Bentin, 2001), and adult English-speaking
learners of Spanish showed a representational asymmetry between
marked and unmarked forms in both comprehension and production
(McCarthy, 2008). The unique contribution of the present study lies in
showing how markedness, or defaultness, interacts with underlying
processing mechanisms in the L2 (prediction, in particular); whereas, in
agreement with previous research findings, L2 learners tend to be generally sensitive to the default gender and number, they appear to make
little or no use of the default when predicting the gender or number of
the upcoming noun in number-adjective agreement.
CONCLUSION
The study found no evidence for a differential treatment of number and
gender in the L1 and L2 at the level of processing costs but found subtle
differences in the priming profiles between L1 and L2 groups. The results
suggest that although nativelike sensitivity to morphosyntactic information in grammatical agreement can be developed in late L2 learners,
they seem to rely on different processing mechanisms even at the
advanced levels of proficiency.
The study contributes to the current debates about the nature of L1-L2
processing differences and provides a new insight into the cognitive
bases of L2 performance. The findings highlight the importance of employing a neutral baseline to dissociate facilitatory and inhibitory priming

components for reaching valid conclusions about L2 morphosyntactic
processing. Together with an examination of the markedness effect, the
method has advantages over a traditional priming paradigm, providing a
more nuanced analysis and allowing researchers to better understand the
intricacies of L2 morphosyntactic processing and to identify the processes
by which grammatical knowledge in a L2 is accessed and deployed.

NOTES
1. The study reported in the paper focused on the comparison of masculine and feminine genders because the more rare neuter gender could present problems for a balanced design in terms of item selection (see the Appendix for details about the masculine
and feminine genders).
2. The cloze test was developed by deleting every seventh word from a reading passage
of intermediate-mid difficulty from the Reading Comprehension Section of the Standard Test
of Russian Proficiency, recommended by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation
(2002, p. 26), and replacing it with a blank of standard length. Responses were scored as
acceptable, semantically acceptable but grammatically incorrect, and unacceptable.
3. The GJT tested sensitivity to agreement violations and included targets in nounadjective and noun-verb dependencies.
4. Similarly, a significant difference in the mean length in phonemes between masculine and feminine nouns was reported by Akhutina and colleagues (1999).
5. The nonword ratio overall and in each list was no greater than 0.50 (Neely, 1991),
but, due to manipulations with the grammaticality proportion, the actual total number of
nonwords did not match the total number of real words exactly.
6. Witzel, Cornelius, Witzel, Forster, and Forster (2013) tested the viability of webDMDX and demonstrated that it can be used to examine language processing with a wide
range of experimental methods commonly used in psycholinguistics and in experimental
psychology in general.
7. The term "semantic memory" refers to a memory system for "words and other
verbal symbols, their meaning and referents, about relations among them, and about rules,
formulas, and algorithms for manipulating them" (Tulving, 1972, p. 386).
8. Although we find the tennis metaphor useful, we are not making any claims about
the nature of gender/number representation.

OVERVIEW OF THE RUSSIAN GENDER AND NUMBER SYSTEM
Russian has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Masculine
nouns constitute about 46% of the nominal lexicon, feminine nouns are at
41%, and neuter nouns are at 13% (statistics based on the 34,000-word
count; Akhutina et al., 1999). According to a more recent count, masculine
nouns constitute 47.5%, feminine nouns are at 34.1%, and neuter nouns
are at 18.4% (statistics based on the 6,000,000-word count; Samojlova &
Slioussar, 2014). For most (but not all) nouns, their ending in the nominative singular acts as an indicator of their gender.
This article focuses only on masculine and feminine genders, and,
because the nouns used in the study were restricted entirely to nouns
with transparent morphological marking, the most important correlations
for our purposes are the following: (a) nouns ending in a hard, nonpalatalized consonant (with zero ending) are masculine, and (b) nouns ending
in -a are feminine if inanimate (Table A1).
Russian has two numbers: singular and plural. The citation form of all
nouns is singular. A plural is formed by the attachment of the plural
morpheme -/-i (or -a for a small group of masculine nouns) to the stem
(the process involves the truncation of the -a vowel in feminine nouns).
To eliminate the need to consider additional process of vowel truncation during processing, this study focuses only on the plural form of
masculine nouns (Table A2).
