Abstract
People place more value on advice from others whom they view as expert; however, the
ways in which advisors might increase perceptions of their expertise through language
choice remains unclear. This article examines a married partner's ability to influence
perceptions of their expertise, and consequent advice outcomes, by making explicit
claims about past experience with a problem. Two experimental studies tested the
effects of experience claims across work versus family problem contexts and examined
dimensions of relational communication as mediators. Findings demonstrated that
experience claims have the potential to affect evaluations of the spouse's expertise and
evaluations of advice; however, this effect varied based on problem context. Results
suggested that statements about previous experience with work problems may improve
advice outcomes, whereas experience claims in the context of family problems lead to
less positive perceptions of advice. Perceived advisor empathy mediated the negative
association between experience claims and advice outcomes.

When people encounter problems, they tend to solicit, value, and utilize advice from
those they view as more expert (Bonaccio & Dalal, 2010; Feng & MacGeorge, 2006;
Sniezek et al., 2004; Van Swol & Sniezek, 2005). Advisor expertise positively biases
advice evaluations, which in turn affect recipients' coping and intention to implement
advised actions (Feng & MacGeorge, 2010; MacGeorge et al., 2013). Collectively, this
research indicates that perceptions of advice as supportive and persuasive depend

heavily on whether advisors are perceived, a priori, as experts. This study examines
factors that affect perceptions of an advisor's expertise and the effects of perceived
advisor expertise on evaluations of advice messages.
One common research paradigm for studying advice, the judge advisor system, involves
manipulating characteristics of the advisor, advice, and/or situation and asking participants
to judge advice. Research engaging the judge advisor system suggests that perceived advisor confidence can influence advice implementation by serving as a proxy for advisor
expertise (Sah et al., 2013; Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001); however, this line of research does
not illuminate the messages advisors might themselves use to influence confidence ratings.
Several studies indicate that recipients respond positively to message elements that signal
the utility of advice, including recommendation clarity (Benjamin & Budescu, 2014) and
arguments that support the advised action (Feng & Burleson, 2008). Correspondingly,
advisors might influence perceptions of their expertise by claiming problem-relevant experience (MacGeorge et al., 2008). In previous research by Wittenbaum (1998, 2000), participants viewed new information shared by experienced small group members as more
important than information shared by inexperienced members. Those studies also showed
that participants perceived experienced members as more competent with regard to the
task at hand. To the extent that experience claims (e.g., "I've experienced a problem like
this before") increase perceived expertise, responses to advice may also improve.
Advice has the potential to improve decision making and facilitate coping (MacGeorge
& Van Swol, 2018); therefore, finding ways to make advice more palatable is a useful
skill for support providers. Understanding how advisors improve advice outcomes by
incorporating specific messages into advice interactions can illuminate factors that affect
advice message processing. In addition, clarifying the types of messages advisors can
employ to increase their perceived expertise may reveal strategies that improve advice
outcomes. Accordingly, we conducted two studies testing the effects of brief experience
claims on advice outcomes. The first study examined the effects of an experience claim,
as well as problem context, on advice outcomes. Study 2 expanded on Study 1 to consider a variety of experience claims, as well as dimensions of relational communication
that may mediate the relationship between experience claims and advice outcomes. As a
context for this study, we chose to examine advice between married partners. When
people encounter problems, they often seek and receive support from close significant
others. Compared with other source characteristics, relational closeness to the recipient
is one of the strongest predictors of receptiveness to advice (Feng & MacGeorge, 2006).
Because a spouse is often a person's closest significant other, spouses can be an important source of advice. In the following sections, we elaborate on the theoretical and
empirical bases for our hypotheses.

What Affects Perceptions of Expertise?
To date, what we know about factors that affect perceptions of expertise comes primarily from experimental research using the judge advisor system and from interaction
recall studies in the field of communication. In experimental studies, advisor expertise
is often manipulated by telling the decision maker that "this advisor is an expert" (e.g.,

Brisini and Solomon

377

Bonaccio & Dalal, 2010) or by reporting the advisor's confidence and accuracy to the
decision maker (e.g., Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001). These proxies for expertise have
each demonstrated associations with judge's willingness to follow the advice (e.g.,
Sniezek et al., 2004; Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001; Van Swol & Sniezek, 2005). Similarly,
in recall studies, an individual's perceptions of a partner's expertise based on previous
interactions is positively associated with the evaluation of and receptivity to advice
(e.g., Feng & MacGeorge, 2006, 2010). In this section, we consider how expertise
might be influenced both implicitly and explicitly by features of advice interactions.
Expertise is a nuanced concept that can be evaluated based on different types of
evidence. An advisor high in expertise has experience with a relevant issue or knowledge that is relevant to the problem (Feng & MacGeorge, 2006). Sometimes, an
advisor's expertise is implied by the circumstances surrounding an advice interaction; for example, a person might expect a mechanic to offer expert advice on car
repairs, but not about gardening. Accordingly, the degree to which the advisor has a
relevant connection to the problem context can serve as a heuristic cue for evaluating advisor expertise. People can also infer experience from context when they deem
someone to have relevant background knowledge because they know them to be
familiar with the situation. For example, in previous research on group decision
making, participants with prior experience related to an appointed task were rated as
more competent and their unique information was more likely to be viewed as accurate (Wittenbaum, 2000). In the context of a family problem, a spouse may have
relevant experience or understand the family dynamic, which provides initial evidence of his or her expertise. In a household with clear work-family boundaries, a
spouse may have less relevant experience with problems that arise in the context of
a partner's work (Clark, 2000). Thus, participants may view their spouse as implicitly more expert with regard to family problems because of their previous experience
with their extended family.
Advisors also have the opportunity, through the discourse that accompanies their
advice, to assert or display expertise that the recipient may not have considered
(MacGeorge et al., 2008). In particular, by describing prior experience with a problem
similar to that of the recipient, advisors may be able to increase recipients' perceptions
of advisor expertise with regard to their problems. Robust evidence suggests that perceived advisor expertise positively influences advice evaluations (Bonaccio & Dalal,
2010; Feng & MacGeorge, 2006, 2010). Van Swol (2009) also demonstrated that advisor confidence influences advice utilization. The missing link is clarifying the messages advisors might use to produce perceptions of expertise or attributions of advisor
confidence.
Previous research provides ample evidence that advisor expertise influences advice
outcomes. Evidence of advisor expertise can be both implicit, with familiarity with the
problem domain serving as a heuristic cue, or explicit, when the individual makes
direct claims about previous experience. With this in mind, we propose the following
hypotheses:

378

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 39(3)

Hypothesis 1: Perceptions of advisor expertise are positively associated with evaluations of advice outcomes, including perceptions of advice quality, facilitation of
coping, and intention to implement the advice.
Hypothesis 2: Explicit experience claims increase evaluations of advisor expertise
and advice outcomes, including perceptions of advice quality, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement the advice.
Hypothesis 3: A spouse is perceived as more expert and advice from a spouse is
evaluated more positively, in terms of advice quality, facilitation of coping, and
intention to implement the advice, in the context of a family problem, compared
with a work problem.
This project consists of two studies, each of which were conducted using online,
Qualtrics surveys. In Study 1, we examined the associations between experience
claims and advice outcomes in response to a hypothetical scenario selected based on a
pilot study. To further probe the associations tested in Study 1, Study 2 included multiple experience claims and also evaluations of relational messages.

Study 1
Study 1 examined the effects of an experience claim and family versus work context on
perceptions of a spouse's expertise and advice. We conducted a study of married, working adults using a between subjects design. We used a hypothetical problem scenario
because doing so allowed us to control for situation, source, and message factors.

Pilot Study and Stimulus Development
A sample of married, working adults (n = 77; 41 female, 36 male; mean age = 40.05)
was recruited to complete an online survey through Qualtrics.com. The pilot study was
designed to evaluate hypothetical problems, advice messages, and experience claims
to be used in Studies 1 and 2. First, respondents rated five hypothetical problems,
which were each tailored to be set in a family context and also in a work context.
Participants rated the five problems for realism, problem severity, and gender neutrality (equally likely to happen to a male or a female). In addition, four "strategies for
solving the problem" were presented with each scenario, and participants rated these
strategies for their quality. To evaluate how participants reacted to experience claims,
we then presented an additional hypothetical scenario and series of advice messages
(with and without experience claims). After each message, respondents rated advisor
expertise and message appropriateness.
A scenario in which two colleagues/family members interrupt a meeting due to
their arguing received the highest ratings for problem realism and problem stressfulness in both the family and work contexts; this problem was also considered the most
gender neutral. Accordingly, this scenario was selected for our studies (see Table 1).
Each of the four strategies for solving the problem presented with this scenario
received mean quality ratings above the midpoint; however, the strategy "speak to the

two family members/coworkers individually before the event" was rated the highest.
Thus, this message was presented to each participant in the main studies as advice for
solving the problem. When designing the advice messages for Study 1 and Study 2, we
included speech elements to emphasize the efficacy, feasibility, and lack of limitations
of the advice messages (see Table 1). This approach is consistent with prior research
showing that these characteristics are associated with high quality advice (Feng &
MacGeorge, 2010; MacGeorge et. al, 2008; MacGeorge et. al, 2013). Finally, we
sought to identify experience claims that an advisor could make that might increase
perceptions of expertise (see Table 2). Across the nine pieces of advice, the claim
"This issue has come up for me, too" received the highest ratings of expertise when
compared with the corresponding version of the message without an experience claim.
To account for the effects of explicit experience claims, this statement was added to
half of the advice claims in each condition for Study 1. In Study 2, we used all four of
the experience claims evaluated in the pilot study.

Method
Participants. The sample for Study 1 included 171 married, working adults (83 males,
88 females), with an average age of 42.88 years (range: 22 to 72 years). Participants
were European American (79%), Latino/a (7%), Asian (6%), and African American
(5%), and married an average of 15.36 years (range: 1 to 50 years). Participants were
recruited via Qualtrics, which locates survey respondents across the United States
using criteria set forth by the researcher. Qualtrics incentivizes participation via cash
payment, online vouchers, and gift cards. For this study, Qualtrics monetary compensation to participants ranged from $2.00 to $2.75.
Procedure. We used a 2 (work vs. family scenario) x 2 (presence vs. absence of experience
claim) between subjects design to manipulate the advice context and message features.

After completing informed consent, participants read a scenario concerning either a problem at work or a problem involving their family. Statements clarifying that the advice was
being offered by the spouse were inserted prior to the advice message. Participants then
completed measures of advice quality, facilitation of coping, implementation intention,
advisor expertise, realism, and problem severity. Measures were completed on 7-point
Likert-type scales (1= strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree), unless otherwise stated.
Measures. The measures used in the current study were evaluated with confirmatory
factor analyses using AMOS/SPSS version 25. A measurement model was constructed
using the following criteria to define adequate model fit: comparative fit index (CFI)
> .90, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < .08. Each item was
assigned to its respective latent construct and latent constructs were allowed to covary.
Based on the modification indices, two items were removed from the advice quality,
facilitation of coping, and expertise scales, along with one item from the problem
severity scale. The resulting model fit the data, 2 = 340.73, degrees of freedom =
155, p < .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .08. Descriptive statistics for measures, including Cronbach's alpha for the composite scales, are provided in Table 3.

Expertise. Participants responded to five items adapted from Feng and MacGeorge
(2010) assessing their perceptions of the advisor's level of expertise concerning the
problem (e.g., "This person has a lot of expertise with this kind of problem"). Two
reverse coded items loaded onto a separate factor during preliminary analysis and
were subsequently removed.
Evaluations of Advice. Respondents evaluated each of the advice messages for quality,
intention to implement the advice, and facilitation of coping. Participants rated the
quality of advice they received based on five characteristics: helpful, inappropriate
(reverse coded), supportive, insensitive (reverse coded), and effective (Goldsmith &
MacGeorge, 2000; MacGeorge et al., 2004). Reverse coded items (inappropriate and
insensitive) were removed from analysis due to low factor loadings. The remaining
three items were used to form the composite measure. Facilitation of coping documented participant perception that the advice they received would help them deal with
the problem at hand. Eight items developed by MacGeorge et al. (2004) assessed facilitation of coping (e.g., "After the conversation, I would be better able to manage any
stress I had about the problem"). Seven items were retained after factor analysis.
Implementation intention was assessed using three items (e.g., "After this conversation, I would plan to follow the advice I was given") commonly used in advice research
developed by MacGeorge et al. (2004). All items were retained for analysis.
Manipulation Checks. To assess participants' perceptions of the seriousness of the
hypothetical scenario, respondents evaluated problem severity using four items (e.g.,
"This problem is an important one"), three of which were retained for analysis. In
addition, two items were used to assess participants' opinions of the level of scenario
realism of the hypothetical problems. Because the two items were not highly correlated, we used "This is a realistic problem that an adult might have" as a single item
measure.

Results
As a first step, we examined the influence of participant sex, years of marriage, perceived realism of the problem scenario, and perceived severity of the problem on the
perceived expertise and advice outcome variables. Bivariate correlations indicated
that realism had a significant positive correlation with advice quality, facilitation of
coping, intention to implement the advice, and expertise. Problem severity was also
positively and significantly associated with advice quality, facilitation of coping,
intention to implement the advice, and expertise. Accordingly, we controlled for realism and problem severity in all subsequent analyses. We also gained preliminary
insight into our variables of interest using bivariate correlations (see Table 4). Advice
quality, intention to implement the advice, facilitation of coping, and expertise were
each positively correlated.
Hypothesis 1 predicted that perceived advisor expertise would be positively associated with evaluations of advice quality, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement the advice. To test our hypothesis, we conducted three separate hierarchical
linear regressions, with perceived realism, problem severity, and problem context
(work vs. family) entered as covariates in the first step, perceived advisor expertise
entered in the second step, and one of the advice outcomes as the dependent variable.
At step one, problem severity and perceived realism significantly predicted advice
quality, F(3, 168) = 10.14, p < .001; R2 = .15, facilitation of coping, F(3, 168) =
18.75, p < .001; R2 = .25, and intention to implement the advice, F(3, 168) = 19.82,
p < .001, R2 = .26. On the second step, advisor expertise significantly increased the
amount of variance accounted for in each of the models, advice quality: F(4, 167) =
16.88, p < .001, R2 = .13; facilitation of coping: F(4, 167) = 38.42, p < .001, R2
= .22; intention to implement the advice: F(4, 167) = 24.30, p < .001; R2 = .10.
Results indicate that perceived advisor expertise was positively associated with advice
quality,  = .43, t = 5.62, p < .001, facilitation of coping,  = .56, t = 8.56, p < .001,
and intention to implement the advice,  = .33, t = 5.31, p < .001. Thus, Hypothesis
1 was supported.
Hypothesis 2 predicted that experience claims would increase evaluations of advisor expertise, advice quality, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement the
advice in both the family and work conditions. Hypothesis 3 examined the associations between problem context and each of our dependent variables. We tested
Hypotheses 2 and 3 using four analyses of covariance with advisor expertise, quality
of advice, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement the advice as the dependent variables. In each analysis, our two dichotomous variables representing the presence or absence of the experience claim and the problem context (work vs. family), as
well as their interaction term, were included as the independent variables. Realism and
problem severity were covaried in each analysis.
In the analysis focused on perceived expertise, results indicated a main effect for the
presence of experience claims, F(1, 172) = 8.91, p < .001, p2 = .05. As anticipated
by Hypothesis 2, participants perceived greater advisor expertise when evaluating
advice messages that contained the explicit experience claim (M = 5.29, SD = 1.19),

compared with the message without an experience claim (M = 4.69, SD = 1.50). In
contrast with Hypothesis 3, problem context was a significant predictor of advisor
expertise, F(1, 172) = 5.00, p < .05, p2 = .03, such that participants evaluated advisors as more expert in the context of a work problem (M = 5.14, SD = 1.39) than in the
context of a family problem (M = 4.92, SD = 1.31).
The findings for perceived expertise were mirrored in the analysis with quality of
advice as the dependent variable. Specifically, the presence of an experience claim
significantly predicted perceived quality of the advice message, F(1, 172) = 3.99, p <
.05, p2 = .02, such that participants who evaluated advice messages that included the
experience claim (M = 5.85, SD = 0.98) reported greater advice quality than those
who read an advice message without the experience claim (M = 5.52, SD = 1.01). The
association between problem context and advice quality was approaching significance, such that participants evaluated advice in the context of a work problem (M =
5.77, SD = 0.94) higher than advice about a family problem (M = 5.65, SD = 1.07),
F(1, 172) = 2.10, p = .07, p2 = .01. These results support Hypothesis 2 and run
counter to Hypothesis 3.
We observed support for neither Hypothesis 2 nor Hypothesis 3 in the analysis
focused on facilitation of coping. In particular, the presence or absence of the experience claim was not significantly associated with facilitation of coping. With regard to
Hypothesis 3, results showed that participants rated advice about a work problem (M
= 5.14, SD = 1.03) higher in facilitation of coping, compared with advice about a
family problem (M = 5.00, SD = 1.11), after controlling for scenario realism and
problem severity F(1, 172) = 3.84, p < .05, p2 = .02.
Finally, the presence of an experience claim was not significantly associated with
participants' intention to implement the advice. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was supported for
two of the four outcomes we examined--perceived expertise and quality of advice, but
neither facilitation of coping nor intention to implement the advice. The association
between the problem context and reports of intention to implement the advice
approached significance, F(1, 172) = 1.81, p = .09, p2 = .02, and followed the same
general trend as the other advice outcomes. Thus, Hypothesis 3 was not supported for
any of the outcomes we examined. Indeed, results suggested that people tend to evaluate a spouse's expertise more favorably and report more positive advice outcomes
when the advice was offered in a work, rather than family, context.
To test whether experience claims have an indirect effect on advice outcomes that
is conveyed by perceptions of advisor expertise, we used bootstrapping procedures,
controlling for realism, problem severity, and context. Unstandardized indirect effects
were computed for each of 1,000 bootstrapped samples, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed by determining the indirect effects at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for the analyses. The indirect effect of experience claims was statistically
significant for advice quality (.17, 95% CI [.05, .29]), facilitation of coping (.24, 95%
CI [.08, .45]), and intention to implement the advice (.19, 95% CI [.06, .32]), but in
each case the direct effect was not significant (all 95% CIs included zero). Thus, while
experience claims did not directly affect advice outcomes, the presence of an

Brisini and Solomon

experience claim was positively associated with advice quality, facilitation of coping,
and intention to implement the advice through its association with advisor expertise.
These results provide further evidence in support of Hypothesis 2.

Discussion
Overall, the findings of Study 1 suggest that brief experience claims are effective at
enhancing perceived expertise and, in turn, improving evaluations of advisor expertise
and advisor quality. Although the use of explicit experience claims demonstrated no
direct effects on facilitation of coping and intention to implement the advice, positive
indirect effects suggest that experience claims are associated with these outcomes
through their association with perceptions of advisor expertise.
Interestingly, advice from a spouse was evaluated more positively in the context of
a work problem, compared with a family problem. Indeed, in the context of a work
problem, participants viewed their spouse as higher in expertise and evaluated their
advice as higher in quality and facilitation of coping, and they indicated that they
would be more likely to implement the advice they received. Although speculative, we
wonder if spouses feel criticized when a partner claims expertise in a shared domain,
such as family life, but react less negatively to advice in a domain where the advisee
clearly has more firsthand knowledge (i.e., the advisee's workplace). Our second study
allowed us to determine if this unexpected pattern replicates and to examine perceptions of relational communication that may underlie these effects.

Study 2
Study 1 identified unexpected associations between the context of the problem and
advice outcomes. To account for these effects, we turned to research on how perceptions of advisors influence responses to advice (e.g., Sah et al., 2013). Most research
has found that demonstrations of confidence serve as a heuristic for advisor credibility
that increases the likelihood of advice acceptance (Anderson et al., 2012; Van Swol,
2009; Van Swol & Sniezek, 2005). Indeed, in the absence of concrete evidence, advice
recipients often use advisor confidence as a sign of advice quality (Sniezek & Van
Swol, 2001; Van Swol, 2009). At the same time, overconfidence may have a negative
influence on advice outcomes, if the advice recipient perceives the confidence to be
unwarranted (Tenney et al., 2008). Such confidence may be interpreted as arrogance,
if the advice recipient doubts the accuracy of the advice message or the advisor's competence (Milyavsky et al., 2017). This body of work suggests that claims of expertise
may affect advice outcomes because of the relational messages they convey.
Relational communication provides information about how individuals regard each
other and their relationship (Burgoon & Hale, 1984). Relational messages, which can
take various specific forms, are subsumed within two general dimensions (Dillard
et al., 1999). The first dimension, dominance-submissiveness, captures status differences and power dynamics between partners. Perceived dominance is the extent to
which an individual interprets a partner's messages as attempting to exert relational

386

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 39(3)

control (Burgoon & Hale, 1984). Reactions to dominance in the context of compliance
seeking have been mixed in previous research, perhaps because studies used different
stimuli (i.e., pictures and text vs. actual interaction) and focused on different kinds of
relationships (i.e., strangers vs. peers). For example, in a study of dominance and persuasion using experimental stimuli, perceived dominance was positively associated
with participant agreement and evaluations of a stranger's trustworthiness (Stefannson,
2010). In contrast, a study of interactions between peers found that exhibiting dominance cues during a group task was not effective in gaining influence and garnered
negative reactions from other group members (Driskell et al., 1993). Dominance also
shares conceptual space with arrogance, which has been implicated in the negative
evaluation of advice messages, as previously discussed.
A second general dimension of relational communication is affiliation-disaffiliation, which captures the extent to which one partner demonstrates friendliness or
warmth toward the other in conversation. Affiliation may be a factor in experiences
and perceptions of empathy, because people empathize with others whom they like
and feel more satisfied in relationships with people they perceive to show them empathy (Cramer & Jowett, 2010). At least one study suggests that claims to experience
with another's situation can foster empathy. In particular, Hodges et al. (2009) conducted a study in which women who were never pregnant, pregnant, or had recently
given birth observed videos of mothers of young children and then wrote letters to the
women they had observed. The mothers in the video then rated the letters for empathy.
In this study, women who explicitly stated that they were new mothers were rated the
highest in understanding, when compared with pregnant and never pregnant mothers,
as well as new mothers who did not explicitly state their status.
In total, the studies we reviewed suggest that relational messages may underlie the
effects of experience claims on advice outcomes; however, the nature of these associations is unclear from previous research. Whereas an advisor's confidence improves
advice outcomes (Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001; Van Swol, 2009), unwarranted confidence can be perceived as arrogance (Milyavsky et al., 2017) and undermine the effectiveness of advice (Tenney et al., 2008). Likewise, prior research provides conflicting
evidence concerning the impact of overt displays of dominance (Driskell et al., 1993;
Stefannson, 2010). Moreover, research on the effects of relational messages conveying
affiliation or empathy is limited to the Hodges et al. (2009) study, which demonstrated
significant associations between explicit experience claims and empathy, but did not
measure affiliation.
Although the specific role played by particular relational messages is thus far
unclear, prior theory and research offers precedents for exploring how relational messages mediate the effect of experience claims on advice outcomes. Theoretically, our
focus is consistent with Watzlawick et al.'s (1967) seminal work and subsequent theorizing (Burgoon & Hale, 1984; Dillard et al., 1996), which conceptualizes relational
messages as inferences that, in turn, affect the subjective meaning of an interpersonal
interaction. Empirically, prior research has shown that the relational messages attached
to specific utterances, such as social-sexual (Solomon, 2006) or hurtful messages
(McLaren et al., 2012), shape evaluations of messages as sexually harassing and the

Brisini and Solomon

387

degree of hurt elicited by a partner's comments. Based on this reasoning, we pose the
following research questions to examine the associations between the use of experience claims in advice messages, evaluations of relational communication, and advice
outcomes.
Research Question 1: What is the relationship between the use of experience
claims and evaluations of an advisor as expressing dominance, arrogance, affiliation, and empathy?
Research Question 2: Do perceptions of dominance, arrogance, affiliation, and
empathy mediate the relationship between experience claims and perceived advisor
expertise?

Method
Study 1 provided evidence that a spouse's explicit experience claims correspond with
increased evaluations of advisor expertise and advice quality. To examine the mechanisms through which experience claims influence advice outcomes, Study 2 replicated
Study 1 and included evaluations of relational communication following the hypothetical advice scenario. In addition, the study examines potential differences in advice
outcomes based on the specific wording of the experience claim accompanying advice
messages from a spouse.
Participants. Study 2 included 183 married, working adults (male = 82, female = 101)
ranging from 22 to 74 years old (M = 44.62, SD = 11.90). Participants were European
American (77%), African American (9%), Latina/o (8%), Asian (4%), Asian American
(2%), and Native American (1%). Again, participants were recruited via a nationwide
Qualtrics panel.
Procedures. Study 2 replicated Study 1 procedures, with two notable exceptions. First,
all four experience claims evaluated in the pilot study were used (including the experience claim used in Study 1; see Table 2). Preliminary analyses revealed no significant
differences in evaluations of advice across these claims; therefore, the four conditions
with experience claims were collapsed for comparison with the condition in which an
experience claim was not presented. Second, the study included measures of relational
communication. Thus, in this study, we used a 2 (work or family context) x 2 (presence or absence of an experience claim) between subjects design. Once again, we
asked married, working adults to complete an online survey using Qualtrics.
Measures. We used the same measures employed in Study 1, and we also included
measures of relational communication. Four 6-point Likert-type scales (1 = strongly
disagree, 6 = strongly agree) asked participants the extent to which they felt their
spouse's advice conveyed arrogance (six items; e.g., self-importance, condescension,
egotism), empathy (six items; e.g., understanding, concern, compassion), dominance
(four items; e.g., influence, control), and affiliation (four items; e.g., liking, positive

388

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 39(3)

regard). These scales capture evaluations both proximally relevant to advice settings
(i.e., arrogance, empathy), as well as general dimensions of relational communication
(i.e., dominance, affiliation).
The measures for Study 2 were evaluated using confirmatory factor analyses (Amos
25) and the same measurement model described in Study 1. Again, we used the following criteria to define adequate model fit: CFI > .90, RMSEA < .08. Following Study
1, two items were removed from the advice quality, facilitation of coping, and expertise scales, along with one item from the problem severity scale. Based on the modification indices, we also removed one item from the advisor empathy and dominance
scales. The measurement model fit the data: 2 = 1106. 86, degrees of freedom = 584,
p < .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .07. Descriptive statistics for measures (i.e., M, SD,
and ) are presented in Table 3.

Results
As a first step, we tested the associations between the demographic characteristics of
our sample and the variables of interest. Ethnicity, age, and years married were not
significantly related to any of our variables of interest. Independent samples t tests
indicated that men reported significantly higher mean scores on intention to implement the advice, t(181) = 1.67, p < .05, perceived advisor arrogance, t(181) = 3.22,
p < .01, and dominance, t(181) = 3.97, p < .001, compared with women. As a manipulation check, bivariate correlations also tested participants' perceptions of the realism
and severity of the scenario they read. Realism and perceived severity were both significantly and positively associated with expertise and each of the advice outcomes, as
well as perceived dominance, affiliation, and empathy. Although demographic characteristics exerted little influence on our substantive variables, realism, and problem
severity demonstrated significant associations. Thus, these variables were covaried
from all substantive analyses. Differences based on the sex of the participant were also
included in initial tests of our hypotheses. Because including sex as a covariate did not
change our substantive results, we report the more parsimonious analysis which did
not include respondent sex. As final preliminary analyses, we examined the bivariate
correlations between the dependent variables (see Table 4). In keeping with Study 1,
advice quality, intention to implement the advice, facilitation of coping, and expertise
were each positively correlated. In addition, perceived advisor expertise was positively associated with perceived arrogance, empathy, dominance, and affiliation.
Similarly, advice quality, intention to implement the advice, and facilitation of coping
were each positively associated with perceived empathy, dominance, and affiliation.
To assess Hypothesis 1, we conducted three separate hierarchical linear regressions
to examine the associations between perceived advice expertise and evaluations of
advice quality, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement the advice. On step
one, realism and problem severity significantly predicted advice quality, F(3, 179) =
5.65, p < .001, R2 = .09, facilitation of coping, F(3, 179) = 2.27, p < .05, R2 = .04,
and intention to implement the advice, F(3, 179) = 3.48, p < .01, R2 = .06. On the
second step, advisor expertise significantly increased the amount of variance accounted

Brisini and Solomon

389

for in each of the models, advice quality: F(4, 178) = 12.52, p < .001, R2 = .13;
facilitation of coping: F(4, 178) = 19.85, p < .001, R2 = .27; intention to implement
the advice: F(4, 178) = 19.74, p < .001; R2 = .25). Results indicated that perceived
advisor expertise was positively associated with advice quality,  = .32, t = 5.51, p <
.001, facilitation of coping,  = .50, t = 8.37, p < .001, and intention to implement
the advice,  = .58, t = 8.05, p < .001. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was supported.
As in Study 1, we tested Hypotheses 2 and 3 using four analyses of covariance with
advisor expertise, quality of advice, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement
the advice as the dependent variables. In each analysis, our two dichotomous variables
representing the presence or absence of the experience claim and the problem context
(work vs. family), as well as their interaction term, were included as the independent
variables. Realism and problem severity were covaried in each analysis.
The first outcome we examined was perceptions of advisor expertise. In contrast to
our hypotheses, examination of the direct effects indicates that neither the presence of
an experience claim, F(1, 182) = .39, p = .48, nor the problem context, F(1, 182) =
.24, p = .70, was significantly associated with evaluations of advisor expertise. Thus,
neither Hypotheses 2 nor 3 was supported.
In the analysis focused on evaluations of advice quality, we found no support for
Hypothesis 2 and only modest evidence consistent with Hypothesis 3. Contrary to
Hypothesis 2 and the results of Study 1, the presence of an experience claim coincided
with decreased evaluations of advice quality, F(1, 182) = 4.38, p < .05, p2 = .02.
This conclusion was qualified by an interaction between the experience claim condition and problem context. Specifically, evaluations of advice quality were not significantly affected by the experience claim in the work context; however, the evaluations
of advice in the family context were significantly higher in the absence of an experience claim, F(1, 182) = 2.56, p = .05, p2 = .02. In support of Hypothesis 3, participants perceived the advice message as slightly higher in quality in the context of a
family problem (M = 5.84, SD = 1.03), compared with a work problem (M = 5.74,
SD = 1.11), F(1, 183) = 3.37, p < .05, p2 = .02.
Results for facilitation of coping and intention to implement the advice also ran
counter to our hypotheses. Specifically, the main effects of the presence of an experience claim on facilitation of coping and intention to implement the advice were not
significant. A significant interaction effect revealed that the presence of an experience
claim coincided with higher reports of intention to implement the advice in the context
of a work problem (with claim: M = 5.46, SD = 1.38; without claim: M = 5.40, SD
= 1.51), and lower reports of intention to implement the advice in the context of a
family problem (with claim: M = 5.22, SD = 1.57; without claim: M = 5.97, SD =
0.85), F(1, 182) = 3.16, p < .05, p2 = .02. In contrast with Hypothesis 3, the problem
context was not significantly associated with either facilitation of coping or intention
to implement the advice.
We posed Research Question 1 to address the associations between the use of experience claims in advice messages and evaluations of relational communication. To
evaluate these associations, we conducted four separate analysis of covariance with
realism and problem severity as covariates and presence/absence of an experience

390

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 39(3)

claim and problem context as the independent variables. Perceived arrogance, empathy, dominance, and affiliation were the dependent variables in separate analyses.
Results indicated that the presence of an experience claim significantly predicted
perceived advisor empathy, F(1, 183) = 3.19, p < .05, p2 = .02, such that messages
with an experience claim (M = 5.49, SD = 1.15) were rated lower in empathy than
messages without an experience claim (M = 5.87, SD = 0.90). The presence of an
experience claim was also significantly associated with perceptions of dominance in
the conversation, F(1, 183) = 2.61, p = .05, p2 = .02, such that messages with an
experience claim were seen as less dominating (M = 3.57, SD = 1.17) than those
without an experience claim (M = 3.92, SD = 1.13). The context of the problem
(work vs. family) did not significantly predict any of the perceived advisor characteristics or perceptions of relational communication.
A second research question considered whether perceptions of relational communication mediate the relationship between experience claims and perceived advisor
expertise. Because results for Research Question 1 showed effects of experience
claims on evaluations of empathy and dominance, we focused our evaluation of
Research Question 2 on those variables. Specifically, we tested the indirect effect of
experience claims on advice outcomes through perceptions of empathy and dominance using bootstrapping procedures and controlling for realism, problem severity,
and context. The indirect effect of experience claims through perceived advisor empathy was negative and significant for advice quality (-.17, 95% CI [-.35, -.01]) facilitation of coping (-.18, 95% CI [-.39, -.01]), and intention to implement the advice
(-.22, 95% CI [-.45, -.02]). All other direct and indirect effects were not significant
(all 95% CIs included zero). Thus, experience claims were negatively associated with
advice quality, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement the advice through its
association with perceived advisor empathy.

Discussion
Study 2 replicated results from Hypothesis 1 and previous research, which provide
evidence that perceptions of advisor expertise are associated with greater evaluations
of advice. In contrast to Study 1, tests of Hypothesis 2 found no association between
the presence of experience claims in the advice messages and evaluations of advisor
expertise. In addition, the presence of experience claims coincided with decreased
evaluations of advice quality in the context of a family problem. In support of
Hypothesis 2, experience claims were associated with higher evaluations of intention
to implement the advice in the work context. Results for Research Question 1 suggested that the presence of experience claims in advice messages are associated with
decreased evaluations of advisor empathy and dominance. In addition, tests of indirect
effects, per Research Question 2, showed that using experience claims negatively
influenced evaluations of advisor quality, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement the advice through its association with advisor empathy.
Study 2 also expanded on Study 1 by testing differences in perceptions of advice
based on the specific wording of the experience claims. To do so, we included four

Brisini and Solomon

391

different experience claims. Interestingly, there were no significant differences
between the four claims examined, suggesting that the specific wording of the claim
used in advice messages may be less important than the presence or absence of a
claim, generally. In the pilot study, advice messages that included an experience claim
were rated higher in expertise and appropriateness, when compared with messages
without the experience claim, regardless of the content of the message or the type of
claim. In Study 2, the presence of an experience claim in the advice message seemed
to improve evaluations of advice in a work context, but was associated with decreased
advice evaluations in the family context. On reflection, we realized that all of the experience claims were pilot tested in the context of a work problem and not in the context
of a family problem. In total, then, our results suggest that experience claims may
improve the outcomes of advice from a spouse concerning professional, but not personal, issues.
Study 2 also expanded on Study 1 by considering the role of perceptions of relational communication in linking experience claims to perceptions of expertise and
advice outcomes. Per Research Questions 1 and 2, the inclusion of an experience
claim was also associated with decreased perceptions of advisor empathy, which, in
turn, was associated with more negative advice outcomes. Although speculative, we
wonder if referring to one's own previous experience, without elaboration, contributes
to an image of the advisor as self-focused or as assuming greater understanding of the
situation than is appropriate. Advice with an experience claim was evaluated as less
dominating across the work and family contexts; however, this association did not
mediate the relationship between experience claims and advice outcomes.

General Discussion
Advice outcomes depend, in part, on whether the advisor is perceived as having sufficient expertise (Bonaccio & Dalal, 2010; MacGeorge et al., 2013). Although previous research has examined some factors that influence perceptions of advisor expertise
(Feng & MacGeorge, 2010; MacGeorge et al., 2013), less is known about how advisors influence recipients' perceptions of their expertise through their communication
and the effects of those efforts on advice outcomes. Prior studies indicate that advice
recipients are responsive to variation in advice message features that index the value
of the advice and the advisor's regard for the recipient (e.g., Benjamin & Budescu,
2014; Feng & Burleson, 2008). Our results suggest that the value of experience claims
in supportive communication may depend heavily on the problem context. This investigation also complements existing research on the effects of advisor confidence (e.g.,
Sah et al., 2013; Van Swol, 2009). Whereas ample research suggests that confidence in
an advisor increases the value of advice (Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001), our results shed
some light on how advisors can build confidence through language.
To review, Study 1 suggested that advisors can use brief claims about prior experience to increase perceptions of expertise, in turn positively affecting recipient evaluations of advice quality, anticipated ability to cope with the problem, and intention to
implement the advice. In contrast, Study 2 showed mixed support for the role of

392

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 39(3)

experience claims in evaluations of advice. In addition, our analyses of advice outcomes revealed significant associations between the use of experience claims and
evaluations of advice in Study 2; however, these findings did not replicate those of
Study 1. In particular, Study 2 suggested that experience claims negatively influence
advice messages in the context of a family problem. These results suggest that experience claims may vary in their associations with advice outcomes depending on the
context of the problem being discussed. Thus, the findings provide qualified support
for advice response theory's core contention that advice message qualities determine
advice outcomes (Feng & MacGeorge, 2010; MacGeorge et al., 2013). Although
speculative pending further investigation, this study suggests that context frames the
meaning of even seemingly straightforward utterances that occur as part of advice
messages.
In their recent Handbook of Advice, MacGeorge and Van Swol (2018) critiqued
advice response theory and previous research on advice for ignoring the potential
influence of relational context on advice outcomes. The unexpected results of these
studies point to advice between married partners as a potentially unique relational
context. In this study, the participants were asked to imagine that their spouse was giving them advice about a problem. Given the high levels of interdependence between
married partners, the advice recipient in this context likely has preformulated beliefs
about the advisor's expertise based on shared experience and observation. For example, results of Study 1 and Study 2 both suggest that individuals may respond more
positively to advice from a spouse about work problems, when compared with advice
from a spouse about family problems. In addition, findings suggest that a spouse's
experience claims may negatively influence evaluations of advice messages in the
context of a family problem, in some cases. As we reflect on the experience claims
examined in these two studies, we wonder if claims to prior experience are more
ambiguous in a family setting, where spouses may have shared experiences with the
problem that is the focus of the advice. For example, saying "I had the same problem
last year" when discussing a spouse's work situation is clearly referring to a similar
problem in the advisor's own work context. In the context of a conversation about a
family problem, however, the experience claim could be construed as being focused
on the same problem, as in "I have also had a problem with your family members arguing at family gatherings."
Although speculative, this reasoning suggests that evoking advisor expertise
through experience claims requires that advisors make clear that they are referencing
different personal experiences. Otherwise, they may be taken as adding their own
complaints to an already difficult situation. A second potential explanation for the
unexpected finding that individuals responded more positively to advice from a spouse
in the context of a work problem lies in husbands' and wives' previous knowledge
about how a partner responds to family problems. Relative to difficulties at work,
spouses may be more likely to have firsthand or secondhand knowledge of each other's extended family conflicts; they may also have preformed opinions about their
partner's ability to mediate conflict based on previous observations. Thus, one spouse
bringing up previous experience may actually degrade a partner's assessment of the

Brisini and Solomon

393

advice if the recipient feels that the advisor is overstating the advice efficacy (and past
success in mediating conflict). In contrast, spouses often do not observe each other in
day-to-day work settings. Thus, a partner's experience claims in the workplace may be
taken at face value, whereas the experience claims in a family setting may or may not
conflict with the spouse's preformed perceptions of a partner's expertise. This possibility suggests future research contrasting expertise claims that occur in situations that
do or do not facilitate firsthand observation of an advisor's expertise (e.g., a coworker
giving advice based on past experience with a work problem).
The relational context of the study may also help explain the associations we
observed involving empathy and dominance. In Study 2, results indicated decreases in
perceptions of empathy when advice messages included an experience claim. In general, spouses are expected to provide emotional support (see Feng, 2009). If the participant was expecting emotional support in response to their problem, the experience
claim may not be seen as an indicator of expertise, but rather as degrading the seriousness of the problem. The fact that the experience claims were not associated with
expertise perceptions would support this interpretation and suggest that experience
claims may be interpreted in other ways (e.g., dismissive). Our findings also add to
previous studies suggesting a complex role for dominance in advice interactions. Like
Stefannson (2010), who used experimental stimuli, we found positive correlations
between perceptions of dominance and advice outcomes (see Table 4). In the context
of spousal communication; however, experience claims tended to suppress this seemingly beneficial feature of advice. Within marriage, it would seem, conveying dominance--without resorting to explicit claims of expertise--may yield the best advice
outcomes.
As a final point, we note that our reliance on hypothetical scenarios and messages
suggests caution about our present conclusions, as well as directions for future
research. In interaction, advisors can elaborate more fully on their own problems,
related emotions, the actions they took, and the outcomes of those actions, building a
narrative of experiential expertise that supports their advice. The fact that effects were
observed for single, short statements suggests a stronger influence when advisors have
the opportunity to elaborate. Of course, the effects of experience claims might also
become diluted by discourse that builds or detracts from expertise and other relevant
advisor qualities. For example, advisors who report extensively on their own experiences might reveal key discrepancies between those experiences and recipients' current problems, undercutting the utility of the advised action. These advisors might also
be viewed as more self-focused, and thus less supportive. We recommend that future
research explore the presentation and effects of experience claims in advising interactions. In addition, use of spouses may be a conservative test of the relationship of
experience claims and utilization of advice. Perceived expertise may be less important
for spouses because we accept their advice due to relationship factors. Indeed, compared with other source characteristics, relational closeness to the recipient is one of
the strongest predictors of receptiveness to advice (Feng & MacGeorge, 2006).
Expertise, both implicit and explicit, may be more relevant when advice is received
from individuals other than one's spouse.
