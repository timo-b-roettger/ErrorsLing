Purpose: To establish the age at which children can complete tests
of spatial listening and to measure the normative relationship
between age and performance.
Method: Fifty-six normal-hearing children, ages 1.5-7.9 years,
attempted tests of the ability to discriminate a sound source on
the left from one on the right, to localize a source, to track moving
sources, and to perceive speech in noise.
Results: Tests of left-right discrimination, movement tracking, and
speech perception were completed by 75% of children older than
3 years. Children showed adult levels of performance from age
1.5 years (movement tracking), 3 years (left-right discrimination),
and 6 years (localization and speech in noise). Spatial release
from masking--calculated as the difference in speech reception
thresholds between conditions with spatially coincident and

here are two main benefits of having two ears rather
than one. By comparing the intensity and timing
of signals between the ears, listeners can localize
sources of sound (B. C. J. Moore, 2003) and can improve
the perception of speech in noise (Litovsky, 2005). These
spatial listening skills help children to be safe outdoors
and to understand speech in noisy environments. To encourage the development of spatial listening, it is routine practice to fit hearing instruments bilaterally to
children with hearing impairment (Ching, van Wanrooy,
& Dillon, 2007; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2009; The Pediatric Working Group of the
Conference on Amplification for Children With Auditory

spatially separate speech and noise--remained constant at 5 dB
from age 3 years. Data from a separate study demonstrate the
age at which children with cochlear implants can complete the
same tests. Assessments of left-right discrimination, movement
tracking, and speech perception were completed by 75% of
children who are older than 5 years and who wear cochlear
implants.
Conclusion: These data can guide the selection of tests for future
studies and inform the interpretation of results from clinical
populations.

Deficits, 1996). It would be desirable, therefore, to have a
battery of tests of spatial listening that could be used to
evaluate the benefits of bilateral fittings in children. This
article describes the rationale, implementation, and evaluation of such a battery.
Ideally, a battery of tests of spatial listening would
meet four criteria. First, the battery would obtain measures of both sound-source localization and speech perception in noise in a single session. Second, the battery
would accommodate the wide range of performance displayed by children of different ages and with differing
degrees of hearing impairment. Third, the battery would
impose low cognitive and linguistic demands to maximize
the number of children who could perform the tests.
Fourth, it would be possible for a single experimenter
to administer the battery to minimize the resources required to test children.
We designed such a battery and evaluated it against
the four criteria. The battery was administered to normalhearing children to establish (a) the proportion of
normal-hearing children in different age bands who
could complete each test; (b) the normal developmental
trajectory of performance as a function of age; and (c) the
reliability of the tests. Normal-hearing adults were tested

to assess the upper limit of performance. The study
differed from previous systematic assessments of the
relationship between age and spatial listening skills,
which concentrated on either sound-source localization
(Clifton, 1992; Van Deun et al., 2009) or speech perception (Vaillancourt, Laroche, Giguere, & Soli, 2008; Van
Deun, van Wieringen, & Wouters, 2010) rather than
both skills together. Moreover, previous studies have
generally not reported the age at which children can
complete tests. That information is of great value when
planning studies. In addition to the study of normalhearing listeners, we analyzed data from a separate
study (Lovett, Kitterick, Hewitt, & Summerfield, 2010)
to establish the age at which children with cochlear
implants could complete the same tests.
The analyses establish the age ranges of normalhearing children and children with cochlear implants
for whom the battery is suitable. Although the battery
was developed and evaluated in the United Kingdom,
its design is generic, and the tests could be implemented
in any language. Accordingly, the results may be widely
useful in guiding the choice of tests for children of different ages, and different hearing abilities, in future studies.
Furthermore, the performance data from normal-hearing
children will aid the interpretation of data from children
with hearing impairment.
This article is organized in three parts. The first
part describes the design and implementation of the
test battery. The second part presents data on (a) the relationship between age and the ability to complete tests
for normal-hearing children and children with cochlear
implants and (b) the relationship between age and performance in normal-hearing children. The latter relationship was not assessed for children who have cochlear
implants because, for this group, performance is influenced by variables such as the number of implants and
the age at diagnosis of hearing impairment, as well as
current age (Lovett et al., 2010). The third part assesses
the strengths and weaknesses of the test battery.

Design of the Test Battery
The battery was designed to be delivered by a semicircular array of 13 loudspeakers and five computercontrolled monitors. The four criteria described at the
beginning of this article were addressed as follows.
First, to measure sound-source localization and speech
perception in a single session, the length of tests was
minimized, and monitors were used to deliver images
and videos that sustained children's interest while rewarding accurate responses. Second, to make the battery suitable for children ranging widely in age and
hearing ability, some tests included a series of conditions
of ascending levels of difficulty, whereas other tests varied the level of difficulty adaptively. Third, to minimize

866

cognitive and linguistic demands, tests required simple
responses; children either turned their head toward a
source of sound or pointed toward toys. Fourth, to enable
the battery to be administered by one experimenter and
to minimize testing time, most of the tests were designed
to measure performance on tasks whose difficulty was
within the likely capabilities of normal-hearing children--
that is, the tests were not designed to measure the psychophysical limits of children's listening skills (e.g.,
Grieco-Calub, Litovsky, & Werner, 2008).
The following sections describe each test in relation
to published assessments of spatial listening skills in
normal-hearing children. Further details of the implementation of the tests are given in the Method section.

Tests of the Ability to Localize
Sources of Sound
When a source of sound is on a listener's left, sound
is more intense at the left ear than at the right ear (an
interaural level difference) because some high-frequency
energy reflects off the head rather than diffracting around
it (Fedderson, Sandel, Teas, & Jeffress, 1957). Moreover,
the sound arrives sooner at the left ear than at the right
ear (an interaural time difference) because the sound wave
must travel farther to reach the right ear. Normal-hearing
listeners use these cues to localize sources of sound on
the horizontal plane (B. C. J. Moore, 2003). For normalhearing children, an ability to localize sources of sound
is present at birth. Newborns turn their head toward a
source of sound (Clifton, 1992), and 18-month-olds can
discriminate the location of two sound sources separated
horizontally by only 6 (Litovsky, 1997; Morrongiello,
1988). (Throughout this article, angular locations denote
points on the horizontal plane, where 0 is straight ahead
and positive angles are to the right.)
We developed two tests of the ability to localize
sources of sound. The first test, known as the Left-Right
Discrimination Test, measured children's ability to discriminate a sound source on the left from a sound source
on the right based on the principles of visual reinforcement audiometry (Bamford & McSporran, 1993). One
condition of this Left-Right Discrimination Test used
two loudspeakers located at -60 and +60, and the
other condition used two loudspeakers at -30 and +30
(Tyler et al., 2002). On each trial, one of the loudspeakers
played a sound. The test measured the percentage of
trials during which the child looked or pointed toward
the active loudspeaker.
The second test, known as the Localization Test,
measured children's ability to locate a source of sound
when presented with more than two possible source

locations. In this test, a stimulus was presented from one
loudspeaker in the array, and the participant was asked
to indicate which loudspeaker played the sound. The
percentage of correct responses was measured. Van
Deun et al. (2009) used a similar test with nine source
locations ranging from -60 to +60 and found that
4-year-olds responded less accurately than adults,
whereas 5- and 6-year-olds performed at a level similar
to that of adults. Bess, Tharpe, and Gibler (1986) used
a 13-alternative task with source locations ranging from
-90 to +90 and found that 6- to 13-year-old children performed at a level similar to that of adults. Thus, performance on localization tests appears to be adultlike by
age 5 or 6 years. We were concerned that a large number
of source locations might be too challenging for young children who have hearing impairment. Accordingly, the
Localization Test was limited to three source locations in
one condition and five source locations in other conditions.
Some listeners, such as a child who is profoundly
deaf with a unilateral cochlear implant, effectively
have only one functional ear. Monaural listeners cannot
perceive interaural differences in level and timing, but
they may be able to turn their heads and use the resulting changes in level and frequency spectrum to localize
sources of sound. If the same stimulus is presented
repeatedly, monaural listeners can learn the level and
frequency spectrum associated with a source location
(Van Wanrooij & Van Opstal, 2004). Nevertheless, on
the horizontal plane, binaural hearing gives more accurate localization than monaural hearing (Van Wanrooij
& Van Opstal, 2004). Therefore, it is possible that a
monaural listener may show above-chance performance
in a laboratory assessment of sound-source localization
due to learning monaural cues during the test and yet
struggle to localize sources of sound in everyday life. To
reduce the opportunity for participants to learn monaural
cues, the Left-Right Discrimination and Localization
tests used stimuli that were roved in level and that had
been recorded by several talkers with different longterm speech spectra.

Tests of the Ability to Track Moving Sounds
A further benefit of having two ears is the ability
to track moving sources of sound. Cranford, Morgan,
Scudder, and Moore (1993) exploited the precedence
effect (Litovsky, 1997) to manipulate the apparent location of the source of clicks presented from a pair of loudspeakers. Normal-hearing children used a laser pointer
to track the source. Children ages 10-11 years tracked
the apparently moving source more accurately than
children ages 6-9 years. We created apparent movement using a method similar to that used by Tyler,
Noble, Dunn, and Whit (2006), in which stimuli are presented from a sequence of adjacent loudspeakers. The

Movement Tracking Test was scored by an observer
who watched the child's behavior during each trial. Performance was scored as correct if the trajectory of the
stimulus could be deduced from movements of the child's
eyes, head, or body.

Tests of the Ability to Perceive
Speech in Noise
Spatial release from masking (SRM) was used as a
measure of the benefit for speech perception of having
two ears (Litovsky, 2005). SRM is assessed by comparing
performance in two conditions: (a) speech and noise are
presented from the front, and (b) speech is presented
from the front, and noise is presented from 90 to one
side. Normal-hearing listeners can identify speech at a
more adverse signal-to-noise ratio in the latter condition
for two reasons. First, the head casts an acoustic shadow
and shields one ear from the noise. Second, the interaural level and time differences of the speech differ
from those of the noise; the auditory system can use
these differences to "cancel" some of the noise (Culling
& Summerfield, 1995; Durlach, 1963).
Normal-hearing children consistently show SRM,
although the group-mean size of the effect varies across
studies from 3 dB to 11 dB (Garadat & Litovsky, 2007;
Johnstone & Litovsky, 2006; Litovsky, 2005; Vaillancourt
et al., 2008; Van Deun et al., 2010). There is some evidence that SRM increases with age. Vaillancourt et al.
(2008) reported that 12-year-old children showed significantly greater SRM than 6- to 10-year-old children on a
test of sentence perception in speech-shaped noise. Similarly, Van Deun et al. (2010) found that adults and children older than age 6 years showed significantly greater
SRM than 4- and 5-year-old children on a test of word
perception in speech-shaped noise. On the other hand,
Litovsky (2005) found that 4- to 7-year-old children did
not differ from adults in the amount of SRM on a test of
word perception in speech-shaped noise. Johnstone and
Litovsky (2006) reported an interaction between age
and the type of masker: 5- to 7-year-olds showed (a) significantly less SRM than adults with an amplitudemodulated noise masker and (b) significantly more SRM
than adults with a reversed-speech masker.
To measure SRM, we estimated speech reception
thresholds in noise using the closed-set Toy Discrimination Test (Summerfield, Palmer, Foster, Marshall, &
Twomey, 1994). Previous assessments of normal-hearing
children reported that increasing age is associated with
improving (i.e., decreasing) speech reception thresholds (Litovsky, 2005; Summerfield, Foster, Moorjani, &
Palmer, 2004; Vaillancourt et al., 2008). The differences
between age groups can be substantial. Litovsky (2005)
compared 4- to 7-year-old children with adults and found

a difference of about 17 dB in speech reception thresholds in noise.

Reliability
One aim of the study was to assess reliability, meaning the extent to which two administrations of a test
with the same child yielded similar results. For all tests,
a subset of the normal-hearing participants was tested
twice for the purpose of assessing test-retest reliability.
The Left-Right Discrimination and Movement Tracking
tests were scored by an observer who made judgments
about movement of the child's eyes, head, and body. For
these two tests, scores from two observers were obtained
for a subset of the normal-hearing children in order to
assess interrater reliability.

Hypotheses
It was predicted that the ability to complete tests
would improve with age for normal-hearing children
and for children with cochlear implants. For normalhearing children, it was predicted that (a) children of
all ages tested would be accurate in discriminating
sound sources on the left from those on the right; (b) accuracy of localization would improve with age and would
approximate that of adults by the age 5 or 6 years; (c) accuracy of movement tracking would improve with age;
(d) speech reception thresholds would decrease with
age; and (e) children of all ages tested would show SRM.

Method

who was unwilling to sit still. The children had passed
National Health Service hearing screening tests with
the exception of one child, who was not born in the United
Kingdom. According to parental report, the children had
normal hearing, had been in good health in the 2 weeks
prior to testing, and had no disabilities or learning difficulties. The children went to an English-speaking preschool
or school and could understand instructions in English.
Eight adult participants, ranging in age from 20 to
24 years, were students of the University of York. They
had pure-tone thresholds equal to or better than 25 dB
HL at octave frequencies between 0.25 Hz and 8 kHz,
inclusive (British Society of Audiology, 2004).
The characteristics of the 50 children with cochlear
implants were described by Lovett et al. (2010). These
children were severely to profoundly deaf and were between 2.3 and 16.9 years of age. Twenty children used a
unilateral implant, and 30 used bilateral implants. Children with implants were stratified by age into seven
groups: 2-year-olds (n = 4), 3-year-olds (n = 8), 4-yearolds (n = 4), 5-year-olds (n = 5), 6-year-olds (n = 6), 7-yearolds (n = 7), and 8- to 16-year-olds (n = 16). The study of
children with cochlear implants took place after the
study of normal-hearing children.
The parents of child participants received an allowance to cover travel costs; adult participants were paid
for their time. Approval was obtained from the Research
Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology of
the University of York and from the North West Research Ethics Committee of the National Research
Ethics Service.

Participants

Apparatus

Fifty-six normal-hearing children were recruited
via preschools and primary schools. These children
ranged in age from 1.5 to 7.9 years and were stratified
by age into seven groups (Table 1). Two additional children were tested and then excluded from the study:
one because of suspected hearing impairment and one

Testing took place in a single-walled booth (Industrial Acoustics Company) located inside a soundshielded room. The booth contained a semicircle of
13 loudspeakers (Bose Acoustimass 3 Series IV). The
semicircle had a radius of 1.65 m, and the loudspeakers
were mounted at 15 intervals on 1-m-high poles. The
loudspeakers were controlled by software running on a
personal computer that produced simultaneous output
via a digital-to-analogue converter (MOTU 24I/O) and
13 custom power amplifiers. Five independently controlled monitors could be positioned below any five of
the loudspeakers. Participants sat in a chair at the center of the semicircle equidistant from each loudspeaker
and facing the seventh loudspeaker in the array. A few
children sat on their parents' laps, in which case the
parents listened to music via headphones to mask the
acoustical stimuli. The experimenter sat in a corner of
the booth and could see a live video feed of the participant
from a camera at 0. Stimulus levels were measured at
the center of the array with a Bruel & Kjaer 0.5-in. microphone (Type 4189) and sound-level meter (Type 2260

Investigator). Prior to testing, the output of individual
loudspeakers was adjusted to give the same level, within
0.1 dB, of an octave band of white noise centered on 1 kHz.

Test Battery
Left-Right Discrimination Test. There were two conditions of this test. The 60 condition used three monitors and loudspeakers situated at -60, 0, and +60. The
30 condition used three monitors and loudspeakers
situated at -30, 0, and +30. At the beginning of a
trial, an audiovisual cartoon clip was presented from 0.
The experimenter viewed the video feed showing the
child's face. When the experimenter judged that the
child was looking forward and paying attention, the cartoon was turned off, and an audio-only speech stimulus
was presented from either the left or the right loudspeaker selected randomly by the computer. The experimenter judged whether the child moved his or her eyes,
head, or body to the left or right. The experimenter
entered the direction of the response into the computer,
which was programmed to record a response toward the
location of the source as correct and to present an audiovisual cartoon at that location as a reward. An incorrect
response, or no response, resulted in no reward and a 3- to
5-s pause before the next trial. The experimenter was
purposely not informed of the location of the stimulus
and listened to music via headphones to mask the acoustical stimuli. To sustain the child's interest, the cartoon
clips were ordered so that they told a story.
The audio-only speech stimulus was a recording of a
female voice saying, "Look over here." There were five
different talkers, one of whom was selected randomly
on each trial. The speech stimuli had been recorded in
the testing booth using a Sennheiser K3N/ME40 microphone and digitized at 44.1 kHz with 16-bit amplitude
quantization. The average stimulus level was 70 dBA
SPL, randomly roved for each trial by 5 dB in 1-dB
steps.
The test began with four practice trials in the 60
condition, during which the experimenter sat next to the
child and pointed toward the sound source. Data from
these trials were discarded. Children then attempted
20 trials in the 60 condition followed by 20 trials in
the 30 condition. The percentage of correct responses
was measured in each condition.
Localization Test. There were three conditions. The
60 condition used three monitors and associated loudspeakers at -60, 0, and +60. The 30 condition used
five monitors and loudspeakers at -60, -30, 0, +30,
and +60. The 15 condition used five monitors and loudspeakers at -30, -15, 0, +15, and +30. Seven wooden
blocks, which differed in color and shape, were placed on
a table in front of the child. Each monitor displayed a
photograph of a different block. A speech stimulus was

presented from a single loudspeaker, selected randomly
on each trial. The child's task was to locate the source of
sound and pick up the block displayed on the monitor
below that loudspeaker. The photograph for each monitor was selected randomly on each trial. We chose to
label the loudspeakers using toy blocks because they
were distinctive, and during pilot testing children did
not show a preference for one block over any other.
The speech stimulus was a recording of a female
voice saying, "Hello; what's this?" There were five talkers, one of whom was selected randomly on each trial.
The speech stimuli had been recorded in the testing
booth using a Sennheiser K3N/ME40 microphone and
digitized at 44.1 kHz with 16-bit amplitude quantization. The stimuli were modified to introduce variation
into the monaural level and spectral cues to source location.1 The average stimulus level was 70 dBA SPL, randomly roved by 5 dB in 1-dB steps.
The test began with four practice trials in the 60
condition during which the experimenter stood next to
a monitor and used live voice to present the speech stimulus. Data from these trials were discarded. Children
then attempted 30 trials in each condition in the following
order: 60, 30, 15. The percentage of correct responses
was measured in each condition.
Movement Tracking Test. We constructed two acoustic scenarios from publicly available recordings. The
first scenario started with a doorbell followed by a door
opening, footsteps, and a door closing. The second scenario started with a bugle followed by a horse's neigh,
hoofbeats, and a second horse's neigh. The elements of
each scenario were presented from a sequence of adjacent loudspeakers such that normal-hearing adults
reported that the sound source moved smoothly around
the edge of the semicircle of loudspeakers. There were
four trajectories of movement, each of which was presented once in a counterbalanced order. Two trajectories
were presented with the footsteps scenario and two
with the hoofbeats scenario. The trajectories were
left-front-right, right-front-left, left-front-left, and
right-front-right. "Left," "front," and "right" denote
-90, 0, and +90, respectively. An independent observer attempted to deduce the trajectory of movement
during each trial by watching a video recording of the
child's behavior while the stimulus was presented. Typical reactions included eye movements, head turns,
and pointing. If the observer deduced the trajectory of
movement correctly, that trial was scored as correct.
The percentage of correct trials was measured. Children
received no instructions unless they asked for guidance,
in which case they were told to "point to show us where
the sounds come from." There were no practice trials.

Stimuli were low-pass filtered at 5.5 kHz and were presented at 71 dBA SPL.
Toy Discrimination Test. Fourteen toys were placed
on a table in front of the child. A recording of a female
voice was presented saying, "Point to the toy name,"
where toy name was one of the toys. The task was to
point to the correct toy. The experimenter checked that
the child knew the names of the toys and administered
practice trials using a live voice before testing began. If
children did not know the names of all the toys, the unfamiliar items were omitted from the test. The software
permitted the test to be run with 14, 10, or four toys.
The stimuli were recorded by Summerfield et al.
(1994). A single recording of the introductory phrase
("Point to the") was used on every trial. The introductory
phrase had a duration of 0.5 s. The toy name was selected
randomly on each trial. The level of each toy-name recording was modified so that all the names were equally
intelligible to normal-hearing adults (Summerfield et al.,
1994). Ten tokens of broadband pink noise were synthesized using CoolEdit 2000 (Syntrillium Software Corporation, Phoenix, AZ). Each noise token had a duration
of 1.4 s and had 0.2-s linear onset and offset ramps. One
noise token was selected randomly on each trial. The
noise started 0.3 s after the start of the introductory
phrase, so the noise was at full amplitude throughout
the utterance of the toy name.
There were three conditions of the Toy Discrimination Test in noise, with noise from -90, 0, and +90. The
speech was always presented from 0. The average level
of the toy names was fixed at 50 dBA SPL, and the level
of the noise was varied adaptively. A one-down one-up
adaptive routine with a step size of 6 dB was used for
the first two reversals. A two-down one-up routine with
a step size of 3 dB was used for the six reversals that followed. The average of the final six reversals was taken
for the purpose of estimating the 70.7% correct threshold
(Levitt, 1971). In the present study, this signal-to-noise
ratio was referred to as the speech reception threshold in
noise (SRT[N]). Three conditions were presented in an
order that was counterbalanced across participants.
For participants who completed all three conditions
in noise, we also measured a speech reception threshold
in quiet (SRT[Q]) to confirm that children could accurately identify the toy names at the level at which the
names were presented in noise. The level of the speech
was varied adaptively, and there was no noise stimulus.
The other aspects of the adaptive routine were the same
as for the conditions in noise. The average of the final
six reversals was taken for the purpose of estimating
the 70.7% correct threshold (Levitt, 1971). In the present
study, this signal level was referred to as the SRT(Q). We
report two sets of measures from the Toy Discrimination
Test: (a) the SRT(N) for each noise location and the SRT

870

(Q) and (b) SRM, calculated as the difference in SRT(N)
between the noise-front and each noise-side condition.

Procedure
Testing took place in a single session that lasted
between 1.0 and 2.5 hr. To maximize the data obtained
from each child, some age groups were excluded from
certain tests based on the results of pilot testing. Children younger than 2 years were excluded from the Localization and Toy Discrimination tests because they found
those tests too difficult. Normal-hearing children age
5 years and older were excluded from the 60 condition
of the Localization Test because they found it too easy.
Children of all ages who wore cochlear implants were
excluded from the 15 condition of the Localization Test
because they found it too difficult. Tests and play breaks
were scheduled to occur in a standard order designed to
provide variety (see Appendix A, available as online supplemental materials). Encouragement was given after
every trial, even if the child's response was incorrect.
The procedure for testing adults was the same as the
one used for testing children, with the following exceptions. Adults responded using a touch screen except for
the Movement Tracking Test, for which they drew the
trajectory of perceived movement onto a diagram of
the semicircle of loudspeakers. For the Toy Discrimination Test in noise, speech was presented at 40 dBA SPL
(i.e., 10 dB lower than for children). Adults completed
two repetitions of all conditions of the Toy Discrimination Test; their mean SRTs are reported.
To assess test-retest reliability, normal-hearing
children in the age groups 3.0-3.9 years and 7.0-7.9 years
were invited to return for a second test session. These
groups were selected because they were the youngest
who could provide data on most of the tests and the oldest children in the study. To assess interrater reliability, two normal-hearing participants were selected at
random from each of the seven groups of children. The
video recording of the child performing one condition
of the Left-Right Discrimination Test was edited to remove the times when the reward cartoon was presented
and then was scored by an observer. Two independent
observers scored the video of the child performing the
Movement Tracking Test.

Statistical Analysis
Statistics were computed using PASW Statistics 18
for Windows (SPSS). All p values are two-tailed. The
tests that measured a percentage of correct responses
yielded data that did not distribute normally and that
showed ceiling effects. For these tests, a Kruskal-Wallis
nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to assess the effect of age group on performance.

Mann-Whitney tests with a Bonferroni correction were
used to assess whether any groups of children showed
poorer performance than the adults.
The Toy Discrimination Test yielded data that were
distributed normally. A one-way independent ANOVA
was used to assess the effect of age group on SRT(Q).
Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc
tests were used to assess whether any groups of children showed higher SRT(Q) than the adults. A twoway mixed ANOVA was used to assess the effect of age
group and noise location on SRT(N). Tukey's HSD post
hoc tests were used to assess whether any groups of children showed higher SRT(N) than the adults. Planned
comparisons with a Bonferroni correction were used to
investigate the effect of noise location on SRT(N). SRM
was calculated by subtracting the SRT(N) with noise at
the side from the SRT(N) with noise at the front, giving
two measures of SRM: with noise left and with noise
right. A two-way mixed ANOVA was used to assess the
effect of age group and noise location on SRM.
Measures of reliability. Two measures of test-retest
reliability were calculated for each test. The first measure is the correlation between the scores from the first
and second test sessions (Rousson, Gasser, & Seifert,
2002). A high correlation indicates that the second
score can be predicted from the first. The second measure is the within-subjects SD of scores (sw; Plomp &
Mimpen, 1979; Summerfield et al., 1994). The sw for a
group of participants is calculated with the equation

where k is the number of participants tested, n is the
number of repetitions of the test, xij is the ith participant's score on the jth repetition, and mi is the ith participant's mean score. A small sw indicates that a test is
reliable. The probability of a randomly selected participant's true score lying within 1.96sw of their observed
score is .95.
The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between
the scores of two observers was calculated as a measure
of interrater reliability (Rousson et al., 2002). A two-way
random effects model was used to generate a measure of
absolute agreement (McGraw & Wong, 1996). This type
of ICC reflects both the degree of covariance, and the difference, between the scores given by the two observers.
An ICC of 1 indicates perfect agreement between observers; an ICC of 0 indicates no agreement. For the Left-
Right Discrimination Test, the ICC between the score
from the observer and the score obtained by the experimenter during the test session was calculated. For the
Movement Tracking Test, the ICC between the scores
from the two observers was calculated.

For the tests that measured a percentage of correct responses, the distribution of data meant that the
assumptions behind correlational analysis, sw, and the
ICC were violated. To provide an alternative metric of
test-retest reliability, we also calculated the percentage
of children whose second score was within 10% of their
first score. Similarly, for interrater reliability, we also
calculated the percentage of children whose score from
the first observer was within 10% of their score from
the second observer.

Results
Ability to Complete Tests
If at least 75% of children within an age group completed a test, we judged that the test was suitable for use
with that age group in future studies. The criterion of
75% is pragmatic. It is high enough to ensure a useful
yield of data but low enough to accommodate a few children who fail to complete tests because of fatigue.
The gray bars in Figure 1 show the age groups in
which 75% of children completed a test for children
with normal hearing (left panel) and children with cochlear implants (right panel). For children with normal
hearing, 75% completed the Left-Right Discrimination
and Movement Tracking tests by age 2 years and all
tests by age 4 years. For children with cochlear implants,
75% completed the Movement Tracking Test and the 60
condition of the Left-Right Discrimination Test by age
3 years, but only by age 8 years did 75% of children complete all tests.
Some children failed to complete a test but, nonetheless, provided data that could be included in analyses.
Data were included if the child undertook at least 15%
of the trials in a condition or, for the Toy Discrimination
Test, achieved at least four reversals in the second phase
of the adaptive routine. The black bars in Figure 1 show
the age groups in which 75% of children provided useable data.

Left-Right Discrimination Test
The results of the Left-Right Discrimination Test for
normal-hearing listeners are shown in Table 2. There
was a significant effect of age group on performance in
the 60 condition, H(7) = 24.96, p < .001, and the 30
condition, H(7) = 38.51, p < .001, such that younger participants showed lower scores. In the 60 condition the
2-year-olds had lower scores than the adults (z = -2.90,
p < .01). All other age groups had a median score of 100%
correct. In the 30 condition, the 1- and 2-year-olds had
lower scores than the adults (z = -2.95 and z = -3.09, respectively, both ps < .01), and the 3-year-olds had scores
that did not differ significantly from those of the adults

(z = -1.79, p > .05). All other age groups had a median
score of 100% correct.

Localization Test
The results of the Localization Test for normalhearing listeners are shown in Table 3. There was a
significant effect of age group on performance in the
60 condition, such that younger participants showed
lower scores, H(3) = 14.46, p < .01. The 2-year-olds
had lower scores than the adults (z = -3.13, p < .05),
whereas the 3-year-olds had scores that did not differ
significantly from the adults (z = -2.38, p > .05). The
4-year-olds had a median score of 100% correct. The
60 condition was not administered to 5- to 7-year-old
children.

There was no significant effect of age group on performance in the 30 condition, H(6) = 8.27, p > .05. There was
a significant effect of age group on performance in the 15
condition, such that younger participants showed lower
scores, H(5) = 17.13, p < .01. The 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children had lower scores than the adults (3-year-olds: z =
-3.13; 4-year-olds: z = -3.02; 5-year-olds: z = -3.30; all
ps < .05). The 6- and 7-year-old children had scores that
did not differ significantly from the adults (z = -2.56 and
z = -2.57, respectively; both ps > .05).

Movement Tracking Test
The results of the Movement Tracking Test for
normal-hearing listeners are shown in Table 4. All age

Because of experimenter error, three 4-year-old children did not attempt the 60 condition.

Toy Discrimination Test in Quiet
The results of the Toy Discrimination Test in quiet
for normal-hearing listeners are shown in Figure 2.
The children who completed the quiet condition displayed SRT(Q) between 10 and 28 dBA SPL. Thus, the
children could understand the speech when it was presented at a lower level than was used for the test in noise.
There was a significant effect of age group, such that younger participants showed higher SRT(Q), F(5, 37) = 7.52,
p < .001. The 3- to 6-year-olds all had higher SRT(Q) than
the adults (p < .05), whereas the 7-year-olds had SRT(Q)
that did not differ significantly from that of the adults
(p > .05).

Toy Discrimination Test in Noise
The results of the Toy Discrimination Test in noise
for normal-hearing listeners are shown in Figure 3.
There was a significant effect of age group, such that

younger participants showed higher SRT(N), F(6, 41) =
4.15, p < .01. Post hoc tests indicated that the 4- and
5-year-olds had higher SRT(N) than the adults (p < .05).
The remaining groups of children did not differ significantly from the adults (p > .05). There was a significant
effect of noise location, such that SRT(N) was higher
when speech and noise were spatially coincident than
when speech and noise were spatially separated, F(2,
82) = 59.87, p < .001. Planned contrasts indicated that
SRT(N) was significantly lower in the noise-left, F(1, 41) =
126.50, p < .001, and noise-right conditions, F(1, 41) =
62.50, p < .001, than in the noise-front condition. The

interaction between age group and noise location was
not significant, F(12, 82) = 1.23, p > .05.

Spatial Release From Masking
The SRM shown by normal-hearing listeners is plotted in Figure 4. Neither the effect of age group, F(6, 41) =
0.63, p > .05, nor the effect of noise location, F(1, 41) =
2.21, p > .05, nor the interaction between age group
and noise location, F(6, 41) = 1.83, p > .05, was significant.

In summary, all age groups showed SRM of about 5.0 dB
on average, regardless of noise location. (One 2-year-old
child completed only the condition with noise from the
front, and therefore her data are shown in Figure 3 but
not in Figure 4.)

The Effect of the Number of Toys on
Performance in the Toy Discrimination Test
The primary aim of the Toy Discrimination Test was
to measure SRM. On the basis of the results of Johnstone
and Litovsky (2006), we expected that SRM would not be
affected by the number of toys the child used during the
test. Accordingly, the primary analyses of SRT(Q), SRT(N),
and SRM included data from children who used four toys
(n = 7), 10 toys (n = 1), or 14 toys (n = 43). We expected
that SRT(Q) and SRT(N) would be affected by the number
of toys the child used, so secondary analyses of SRT(Q)
and SRT(N) were conducted using data only from children who used 14 toys. The findings of the primary and
secondary analyses were very similar and do not lead to
substantively different conclusions (see Appendix B,
available as online supplementary materials).

Test-Retest Reliability
Eight normal-hearing 3-year-olds and seven normalhearing 7-year-olds returned for a second test session.
Some 3-year-olds did not complete all of the tests. The
mean interval between sessions was 21 days (range =
2-55 days). For the tests that measured a percentage
of correct responses, Table 5 lists Kendall's rank-order

Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients and
sw. As a guide to interpreting sw, consider that a randomly selected participant's true score lies within
1.96 sw of their observed score with a probability .95.
Thus, for the example of the noise-left condition of the
Toy Discrimination Test, a randomly selected child's
true score lies within 5.0 dB of their observed score
with a probability .95.

Four criteria influenced the design of the battery.
The first criterion was that it should obtain evidence of
abilities in sound-source localization and speech perception in noise in a single test session. Evidence of both
skills was obtained from at least 75% of normal-hearing
children older than age 3 years and from at least 75% of
children older than age 5 years who used implants. The
second criterion was that the battery should be suitable
for participants who varied in their age and hearing abilities. The simplest tests were completed by children as
young as 1.5 years, but more advanced tests were completed only by older children. The data in this article,
and the results of Lovett et al. (2010), demonstrate
that the tests are suitable for normal-hearing children,
normal-hearing adults, and children with cochlear
implants.
The third criterion was that the battery should
impose low cognitive and linguistic demands. This requirement appears to have been met, given that the
simplest tests were completed successfully by children
age 1.5 years. Nonetheless, it is likely that a child's cognitive and linguistic abilities influence their performance,
an issue discussed in the Relationship Between Age and
Performance subsection. The fourth criterion--that the
battery should be delivered by only one experimenter--
was met. Prior to the present study, the experimenter
had spent about 10 hr conducting listening tests with children. Thus, an advantage of this battery is that it can be
administered by an experimenter who has not received
extensive training (cf. Werner Olsho, Koch, Halpin, &
Carter, 1987).
Overall, the test battery met the design criteria.
Nonetheless, there are some weaknesses in the current
implementation. Children with cochlear implants did
not consistently complete tests of both sound-source localization and speech perception until they were 5 years
old and did not consistently complete all tests until they
were 8 years old. On some tests, such as the 30 condition
of the Localization Test, several children with cochlear
implants found the test challenging and became discouraged, which explains why few children completed all
trials. This observation is supported by previous reports
that children with cochlear implants show lower levels
of performance on tests of listening skill than do their
normal-hearing peers (e.g., Grieco-Calub et al., 2008;
Van Deun et al., 2010). It is possible that data would be
obtained more consistently from children with cochlear
implants if the experimenter administered a subset of
the tests rather than attempting to administer all of the
tests. A further shortcoming is that the Left-Right Discrimination, Localization, and Movement Tracking tests

suffer from ceiling effects with normal-hearing participants. For children who use cochlear implants, however, ceiling effects are absent on all tests except the
60 condition of Left-Right Discrimination (Lovett
et al., 2010).

Reliability
On the Left-Right Discrimination, Localization,
and Movement Tracking tests, the variability in scores
was low because of ceiling effects. Consequently, measures of reliability--such as the correlation between
first and second test scores, sw, and the ICC--are uninformative. Nonetheless, there is evidence that the tests
are reliable. On the Left-Right Discrimination, Localization, and Movement Tracking tests, more than 70%
of children had a second test score that was within
10% of their first test score. On the Left-Right Discrimination and Movement Tracking tests, more than 80% of
children had a score from the first observer that was
within 10% of their score from the second observer. Further work is required to assess the reliability of these
tests in populations that do not show ceiling effects.
For the Toy Discrimination Test, the measures of
test-retest reliability can be compared with those
reported by Summerfield et al. (1994), who administered the quiet condition to 136 children ages 2-13 years.
Summerfield et al. reported a correlation between the
first and second test scores of +.95 and a sw of 2.5 dB.
In the present study, we measured lower test-retest
correlations (ranging from +.04 to +.69) and similar or
higher values of sw (ranging from 2.5 to 3.2 dB). Thus,
the present implementation of the Toy Discrimination
Test shows poorer test-retest reliability than has been
estimated previously. This difference may have arisen
because the second test session took place several days
after the first session, whereas Summerfield et al. repeated the test on the same day. It is also possible that
the weak correlations between the first and second test
scores in the present study were caused by a lack of statistical power.

Application to Future Studies
To illustrate the use of Figure 1, consider a hypothetical project to measure the ability of children to
show SRM and to localize sources of sound. If the participants had normal hearing, it is likely that at least 75%
of children older than age 3 years would complete the
assessments if the study employed the Toy Discrimination Test and any combination of the Left-Right Discrimination Test, the Movement Tracking Test, and the 60 or
30 conditions of the Localization Test. If the participants
used cochlear implants, it is likely that at least 75% of
children older than age 5 years would complete the

876

assessments if the study employed the Toy Discrimination
Test, the 60 condition of the Left-Right Discrimination
Test, and the Movement Tracking Test.

Relationship Between Age
and Performance
Evidence that performance improved with increasing age was found for the Left-Right Discrimination, Localization, and Toy Discrimination tests. Several factors
may contribute to this developmental trend. Maturational changes in the auditory cortex, which continue
until the early teenage years, may enable improved listening skills (J. K. Moore & Linthicum, 2007). Moreover,
the size of a child's head affects the interaural differences
in level and timing that they experience. The majority of
growth in head size is accomplished by age 2 years, but
slower growth continues until adulthood, which means
that children must repeatedly recalibrate the association
between interaural differences and source locations
(Litovsky & Ashmead, 1997). As a child's head approaches
adult size, there will be a reduced need to recalibrate,
which may contribute to more accurate localization by
older children.
Although the test battery was designed to impose
minimal cognitive and linguistic demands, age-related
improvements in attention, memory, and language
skills may have contributed to better performance by
older children. An additional analysis of performance
in the Left-Right Discrimination Test indicated an effect of attention, in that children in the youngest group
(1.5-1.9 years) failed to respond on 10% of trials, whereas children older than age 4 years responded on every
trial. The Localization and Toy Discrimination tests required children to identify the correct toy and to remember that toy while searching among the toys on the table.
Thus, these tests required children to retain the correct
answer in working memory, whose capacity increases
throughout childhood (Gathercole, 1999). An increase
in working memory may have contributed to the improvement in performance with age. For the Toy Discrimination Test, it is likely that older participants with better
language skills were more familiar with the target
words and were more able to generate answers from a
partially perceived word than younger participants with
poorer language skills (Elliott et al., 1979).
Performance on the Movement Tracking Test was
uniformly high with no effect of age, in contrast to a previous report that auditory movement tracking improves
with age (Cranford et al., 1993). The difference in results
probably occurred because the Movement Tracking Test
is less challenging than the test employed by Cranford and
colleagues (1993). Nonetheless, the Movement Tracking Test is useful because it is quick, highly engaging,

As expected, normal-hearing children and adults
identified spoken words at a more adverse signal-tonoise ratio when noise was presented from the side
than when noise was presented from the front (the location of the source of the speech). Participants showed
SRM of about 5 dB, on average, and there was no significant effect of age group. To check that clustering the
children into groups was not disguising an effect of age
on SRM, we calculated the correlation between children's age in months and SRM. The correlation was
not significant (Pearson's r = .28, p > .05), which suggests
that there was no significant effect of age on SRM. Some
studies have reported that children show less SRM than
adults with a noise masker (Johnstone & Litovsky, 2006;
Vaillancourt et al., 2008; Van Deun et al., 2010), whereas
other studies found no significant effect of age on SRM
with either a noise masker (Litovsky, 2005) or a speech
masker (Garadat & Litovsky, 2007). Further work is
required to establish the extent to which the test materials influence the relationship between SRM and age.

The test battery was used successfully to obtain performance measures of sound-source localization and
speech perception in noise from (a) at least 75% of normal-hearing children older than 3 years and (b) at least
75% of children older than 5 years who use cochlear
implants. Normal-hearing children as young as 3 years
were able to localize sounds, track moving sounds, and
benefit from SRM. The ability to perceive speech in
quiet and in noise improved with age. The results can
aid in the selection of tests for future studies and inform
the interpretation of data from clinical populations.
