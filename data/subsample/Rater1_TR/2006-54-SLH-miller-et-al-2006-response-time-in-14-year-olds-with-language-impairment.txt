Purpose: To determine whether children with language impairment were slower
than typically developing peers at age 14, and whether slowing, if present, was
similar across task domains; whether differences in response time (RT) across domains
were the same for children with specific language impairment (SLI) and nonspecific
language impairment (NLI); and whether RT performance at age 9 predicted
performance at age 14.
Method: Fourteen-year-old children with SLI (n = 20), NLI (n = 15), and typical
development (NLD; n = 31) were administered several linguistic and nonlinguistic
speeded tasks. The children had received the same tasks at age 9. RT performance
was examined.
Results: Both the SLI and the NLI groups were significantly slower than the NLD
group in motor, nonverbal cognitive, and language task domains, and there was
no significant difference among domains. Individual analyses showed that most, but
not all, children with SLI and NLI were slower than the NLD group mean. Slowing
at age 9 and age 14 were moderately correlated.
Conclusions: The results suggest that slow RT is a persistent characteristic of many
children with language impairment; however, the nature of the relationship between
RT and language performance requires further investigation.

hildren with specific language impairment (SLI) demonstrate
language abilities significantly below what is expected for their
age, but show no evidence of hearing impairment, frank neuropathology, autism spectrum disorders, or other factors usually associated
with language impairment (Leonard, 1998). Their nonverbal cognitive
functioning must, by definition, be within normal limits (see TagerFlusberg & Cooper, 1999, for a discussion of this criterion), yet it is well
documented that children with SLI have difficulties with many nonlinguistic cognitive tasks (Johnston, 1994; Leonard, 1998).
One area in which children with SLI demonstrate cognitive limitations is response time (RT). Children with SLI have been found to respond more slowly than age-matched peers on a variety of RT tasks. For
example, Johnston and Ellis Weismer (1983) used a mental rotation task,
in which children were asked to compare two complex shapes, one rotated
to a different angle than the other, and determine if they were the same.
Sininger, Klatzky, and Kirchner (1989) measured time required to determine if a digit had been part of a previously presented set. Windsor,
Milbrath, Carney, and Rakowski (2001) provide a meta-analysis of archival RT data involving children with language impairment.
Although there are a number of studies of RT in children with language impairment, few longitudinal data have been available. Here we

report data from a group of children who participated
in the same battery of RT tasks at 9 and 14 years of
age. Data from the age 9 data collection were reported in
Miller, Kail, Leonard, and Tomblin (2001). In that paper,
we found that children with language impairment (LI)
had slower RTs across the entire battery of linguistic and
nonlinguistic tasks compared with typically developing
peers, in accordance with the results of meta-analyses
by Kail (1994) and Windsor and Hwang (1999). We distinguished between children with SLI, whose nonverbal
IQ scores were within normal limits, and children with
nonspecific language impairment (NLI), who scored below
normal limits on both language and nonverbal IQ. We
found that children with NLI were slower than children
with SLI. In the current study, we ask if children with
SLI and NLI continue to be slower than age peers at
age 14, if slowing is similar for different types of RT
tasks, and if there are differences between the SLI and
NLI groups.

Development and Response Time
Across Domains
Over the course of normal development, RTs become
faster, peaking in adolescence and young adulthood (Kail,
1991b). RT is considered by some researchers to index
a global processing speed parameter that becomes faster
as children grow older and slows again as adults age
(Cerella & Hale, 1994). There is evidence, however, that
developmental changes in speed over the life span are
not uniform across all types of tasks. Cerella and Hale
described several possible ways to divide RT tasks into
theoretically and empirically distinct domains. One important division may be between simple perceptual-motor
tasks and more complex tasks. Lima, Hale, and Myerson
(1991) proposed a distinction between lexical and nonlexical tasks (which were in fact nonlinguistic). Examining a sample that included some of the children from the
present study, Kail and Miller (2006) found differences
between language and nonlanguage tasks that change
over time. In our current work, we included both language
and nonlanguage tasks. Our tasks can be categorized into
three domains, which we refer to as motor, (nonverbal) cognitive, and language, and which have been investigated
in the literature on RT (Cerella & Hale, 1994).
Slow RTs in children with LI are consistent with the
hypothesis that a general neuromaturational delay underlies LI (Bishop & Edmundson, 1987; Locke, 1994).
Locke suggested that in many cases of LI, a general neuromaturational delay slows early lexical development. Because of the lexical delay, children have not amassed the
lexical knowledge needed to move into an analytic stage
of language development (i.e. grammar) at the time when
the neurological grammatical mechanism is available. If

this critical period for grammatical development is missed,
compensatory mechanisms must be called into use, leading to less than optimal language performance. According to this view, children with LI are unlikely ever to reach
the level of proficiency of their peers. If Locke is correct, one
would predict that children with LI would continue to be
slower than age peers on RT tasks related to language,
while nonlanguage tasks may improve if the general maturational delay is overcome.
In a longitudinal study, Bishop and Edmundson (1987)
examined language and motor impairment in children
with SLI from 3 2 to 5 2 years of age. The children with
SLI took longer to perform a motor task than typically
developing children, but over time the impaired children's
performance approached that of controls. In contrast, only
some of the children showed evidence of catching up with
controls on language measures. On the basis of these findings, we might predict that motor RTs for children with LI
will approach those of typically developing peers as the
children move into adolescence.
However, in a cross-sectional study of children ranging in age from 8 to 13 years, Kohnert and Windsor (2004)
found that children with LI (who had normal nonverbal
IQs) were slower than typically developing peers on three
perceptual-motor tasks--simple and choice visual detection tasks and a choice auditory detection task--but not
on a fourth, simple auditory detection. Age was controlled
for in the analyses. The same children were also tested
for RT on language tasks (Kohnert, Windsor, & Miller,
2004; Windsor & Kohnert, 2004). They were slower than
peers on word recognition and picture naming, but not on
an auditory lexical-decision task.
RT is not only a reflection of processing speed, however. It is also affected by knowledge. For example, in picture naming tasks, adults who are proficient language
users are slower to name low-frequency words compared
with high-frequency words (Johnson, Paivio, & Clark,
1996). The difference in RT can be interpreted as an indication that more frequent words have a stronger representation (Nation, Marshall, & Snowling, 2001); that is,
the individual "knows" high-frequency words better. An
example from language disorders is found in Kail and
Leonard (1986); on the basis of the results of several tasks
designed to tap lexical knowledge in various ways, they
concluded that the slower RTs of children with SLI were
due to their less extensive lexical knowledge, compared
with age-matched peers.
If language knowledge--semantic or syntactic--
contributes to RT performance, then we might expect
a developmental pattern rather different from the predictions of a neuromaturational delay model. Children
with LI do gain knowledge of language over time. As
they move into adolescence, a general speed deficit may
delay RTs on all tasks, but for language tasks, increasing

knowledge may lead to better RT performance. Whereas
RTs might still be delayed relative to typically developing peers, language tasks would be less delayed than cognitive tasks (e.g., mental rotation) that rely minimally
on knowledge and maximally on processing.
In summary, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that RT slowing in children with LI
at age 14 will not be identical across motor, cognitive,
and language domains. However, it is difficult to make
predictions about how RTs in the three domains will
differ, because the mechanisms contributing to RTs and
to language impairment are not fully understood. Among
the information about language impairment that is
lacking is whether SLI and NLI are underlyingly different (Bishop, 1994). We expect, based on prior findings
(Miller et al., 2001), that the children with NLI will be
slower than the children with SLI, but we do not know
if the pattern across domains will be similar for the two
groups.
As developmental questions are at issue, it is
appropriate to ask whether RT performance at age 9
predicts performance at age 14. A finding that children
with LI are slower than age peers at both times does
not necessarily imply that individuals within the groups
are relatively slow or fast at both times. Correlational
analyses relating RTs at the two time points will allow us
to estimate the degree to which an individual's standing
relative to the sample at age 9 is consistent with the
individual's relative standing at age 14. The relationships between RTs at the two times may vary according
to domain.

Research Questions
The current study addressed four research questions.
The first was whether the children with language impairment, both SLI and NLI, who were slower than typically
developing peers at age 9 continued to be slower at age 14.
The second question was whether slowing, if present,
was similar across domains. Third, we asked if the differences in RT across domains were the same for children
with SLI and NLI. Our fourth question was influenced by
the finding that although, as a group, children with SLI
and NLI usually demonstrate slower RTs than typically
developing peers, slowing may not be characteristic of all
children with language impairment (Miller et al., 2001;
Windsor & Hwang, 1999), and it is not known if individuals who are slow will remain so over time. With
data from the same children at two time points, we asked
whether RT performance at age 9 predicted performance
at age 14; that is, did children who were relatively fast
(or slow) at age 9 retain their standing in the sample at
age 14?

Method
Participants
The participants were a subset of those involved
in a large-scale investigation of the prevalence of SLI
conducted at the University of Iowa (Tomblin et al., 1997).
A large sample of kindergarten children was drawn from
urban, suburban, and rural schools in midwestern communities. All the children received a brief language screening test composed of 40 items from the Test of Language
Development--Second Edition: Primary (TOLD-P:2;
Newcomer & Hammill, 1988). All children who failed the
screening, and approximately 33% of those who passed,
were recruited to participate in a diagnostic test battery.
Children were excluded from participation in the diagnostic phase if they (a) did not have English as their primary language or came from a home where English was
not the predominant language; (b) had a history of mental
retardation, autism, or neurological problems; or (c) were
blind or used hearing aids. Details of the sampling and
procedure can be found in Tomblin et al.
The diagnostic battery included measures of hearing, language, speech, and nonverbal intelligence. Children with persistent bilateral hearing deficits were excluded from further testing. For performance IQ, a combined standard score greater than 87 on two subtests of the
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence--
Revised (Wechsler, 1989) was considered to be an ageappropriate level. Language ability was measured by a
battery including selected subtests of the TOLD-P:2
(Newcomer & Hammill, 1988) and a narrative story task
involving both production and comprehension (Culatta,
Page, & Ellis, 1983). Scores were standardized based on
local norms and combined to form five composite scores. A
child was considered below age level on the language
battery when two or more composite scores were 1.25 SDs
below the mean for the child's age group. Further information about the diagnostic testing is given in
Tomblin, Records, and Zhang (1996).
The parents of all children who participated in the
diagnostic procedure were invited to join a registry. All
children in the registry who were language impaired
at kindergarten were invited to participate in a longitudinal study; 231 (82% of those invited) agreed to join. In
addition, 442 children whose language status was normal at kindergarten were randomly sampled and invited to participate; 373 agreed. See Tomblin, Zhang,
Buckwalter, and Catts (2000) for details regarding the
subject recruitment and selection process.
These children were administered a similar diagnostic battery 2 years after the original diagnostic phase,
when most of the children were in second grade. Language tests included the Peabody Picture Vocabulary

Test--Revised (PPVT-R; Dunn & Dunn, 1981), the Comprehensive Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test
(CREVT; Wallace & Hammill, 1994), and selected subtests
of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals--
Third Edition (CELF-3; Semel, Wiig, & Secord, 1994), as
well as an experimental measure of narrative production. Nonverbal intelligence was measured using the Performance Scale of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children--III ( WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991). Composite
scores were computed in the same manner as for the
kindergarten battery, and diagnostic classifications
were made.
For Miller et al. (2001), we selected three groups
of children from the sample described previously whose
performance placed them in the same diagnostic category at both testing points (in kindergarten and 2 years
later). The NLI group (n = 19) was made up of children
who scored below age expectations on both performance
IQ and language; however, all of these children had performance IQs between 72 and 83 (i.e., they would not be
considered mentally retarded). The SLI group consisted
of 29 children whose performance IQ was age appropriate but who scored below age expectations on language,
while the normally developing (NLD) group consisted of
29 children whose performance IQ and language scores
were within the age-appropriate range. The NLD and SLI
groups were matched for performance IQ. Each group's
mean was 99, with a 95% confidence interval of 96-102.
The groups did not differ significantly, t(56) = 0.03, p > .95.
The performance IQ of children with NLI was significantly
lower than the children with SLI, t(46) = 10.5, p < .0001.
Of these 77 children, 70 participated in the RT tasks
again when they were about 14 years old. As part of
the larger study, all of the children received a diagnostic
battery including the PPVT-R, the Expressive scale of
the CREVT, the Concepts and Directions and Recalling
Sentences subtests of the CELF-3, and the Qualitative
Reading Inventory--3 (QRI; Leslie & Caldwell, 2001)
to assess discourse comprehension and production. For
the purposes of placing children into diagnostic categories, the WISC-III Block Design and Picture Completion subtests were used as a measure of performance IQ.
The children who participated in the RT tasks also received two untimed subtests of the Universal Nonverbal
Intelligence Test (UNIT; Bracken & McCallum, 1998).
Table 1 summarizes test scores from the diagnostic
battery administered at age 14 for each group, including nationally normed standard scores for the PPVT-R,
CREVT-R, and CELF-3. Scores for the QRI are composite z scores, combining the listening comprehension and expressive discourse portions of the QRI. The
language and QRI z scores were obtained by normalizing based on the distribution of the entire sample of
527 children tested in the Iowa project at age 14. Of the
70 children who participated in the RT tasks, 4 scored

within normal limits on language but below normal
limits on performance IQ. At the time these children participated in the first round of RT data collection, 1 had
been classified as NLD, 1 as SLI, and 2 as NLI. These
children were excluded from analysis for the present
study; therefore, N = 66. Some children in the NLD, SLI,
and NLI groups at age 14 had been classified earlier in
a different diagnostic category: 8 of the NLD group had
been SLI, 4 of the SLI group had been NLD and 2 NLI,
and 1 of the NLI group had been NLD and 4 SLI. Analyses were based on diagnosis at age 14.
Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed,
and significant main effects of group (ps < .01) were found
for all language and IQ variables. Post hoc comparisons
were conducted using the unequal N honestly significant
difference (HSD) test, a modification of the Tukey test
(Statsoft, 2004). The NLD group had significantly better
scores ( ps < .01) than both the SLI and the NLI groups for
the UNIT, language z score, and all standardized language tests. For performance IQ, the NLD and SLI groups
did not differ, but both had higher mean scores than the
NLI group ( ps < .05).

Table 1 also shows data regarding sex, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) for each group. The
measure used for SES is years of mother's education,
which has been found to be a good predictor of language
outcome (Chapman, Schwartz, & Kay-Raining Bird, 1991).
There was a significant effect of group for this variable
( p < .02); education data were missing for 1 child in the
NLD group. Post hoc unequal N HSD tests showed that
mother's education was significantly higher for the NLD
group compared with the NLI group ( p < .05).

Design and Materials
All tasks were presented on a laptop computer, and
children responded by striking a key on the keyboard
or by speaking a word on the picture naming task (see
below). Auditory stimuli were presented monaurally by
computer over headphones. Each task included multiple conditions. With three exceptions (described below),
trials for different conditions were in quasi-random order; one trial for each condition occurred, randomly ordered, then another set of randomly ordered trials, and
so on. Trials in the simple RT task were truly randomly
ordered; trials for the tapping and picture matching
tasks were blocked. Two main types of tasks were used:
nonlinguistic tasks and linguistic tasks. The tasks were
chosen to tap a wide range of linguistic and nonlinguistic
abilities. Table 2 provides a summary of the tasks, with
a brief description and statement of how RT was measured for each. Examples of the stimulus items are shown
in Table 2 and can also be found in Miller et al. (2001).
Nonlinguistic tasks. There were two types of nonlinguistic tasks: motor and nonverbal cognitive. The motor tasks involved motor performance only, with minimal
language and cognitive components. In the tapping task,
the child was asked to tap a key as many times as possible
in 5 s. The beginning and end of each interval were signaled both visually (by the words "Start" and "Stop") and
aurally (by a tone). There were three tapping conditions,
with three trials in each. The trials were blocked by condition. In the first condition, the child tapped one key
with the index finger of the preferred hand. In the second,
the child tapped two keys (located on the same row but
with one key between them) in alternation, using the index finger of the preferred hand. In the third condition,
the child tapped the same two keys in alternation, but
used the first two fingers of the preferred hand. Each
key was marked by a colored dot, a different color for
each key.
The other motor task was a simple RT task. The
child was instructed to strike a key marked by a colored
dot as quickly as possible in response to a visual signal. On each trial, the child first saw the word "Ready,"
followed by the response signal (three asterisks) after a
delay of 1, 2, or 5 s. There were eight trials at each delay.

716

The conditions were randomly ordered, so the child could
not anticipate the length of the delay.
The nonverbal cognitive tasks involved more cognitive operations than the motor tasks, but did not include
linguistic components nor lend themselves to verbal mediation. Both of the nonverbal cognitive tasks, visual search
and mental rotation, are commonly used in the cognitive
development literature to assess speed of processing (see
Kail, 1991a, for a review). In the visual search task, simple nonsense figures (from Kail, Pellegrino, & Carter, 1980;
see Figure 1 for examples) were used. The child was shown
a target figure and then required to scan a five-member
array for the target, which remained visible. The child was
instructed to scan the array from left to right, pressing one
key (marked with a green dot) when the target was present
or a different key (marked with a red dot) when it was
absent. There were six conditions in this task, as the target
could be in any of the five positions from left to right or it
could be absent. There were six trials per condition.
In the mental rotation task, the same figures were
used as in the visual search. A target figure was shown on
the left, simultaneously with the same figure on the right.
The child had to press one key (marked with a green dot)
when the second figure was exactly the same as the target or a different key (marked with a red dot) when it was
a mirror image. The second figure was rotated 0, 60,
or 120 clockwise from its canonical position. There were
six trials in each of the six conditions.
Linguistic tasks. Three types of linguistic tasks were
used: lexical tasks were intended to require the child
to access word meanings, grammatical tasks required
a response based on the syntactic structure of a sentence,
and phonological tasks involved judgments about speech
sounds. There were two of each task subtype. In all tasks
requiring a keypress response, the child pressed one key
(marked with a green dot) for a yes or positive response
and a different key (marked with a red dot) for a no or
negative response.
One lexical task, picture matching, required the child
to judge whether two pictures, presented simultaneously,
matched on a given criterion. This task involves accessing
lexical items and components of their meanings, such as
category membership. It was based on a task used by Kail
and Leonard (1986, Experiment 3), but used different
pictures. Trials were blocked by condition, with 12 trials
in each condition. In the first block of trials, the child
judged whether the two pictures were identical physically. In the second block, the child judged whether the
pictures had the same name (e.g., two nonidentical cats).
In the third block, the child judged whether they belonged
to the same category (e.g., animals).
In picture naming, derived from Leonard, Nippold,
Kail, and Hale (1983), the child named aloud pictures
that appeared on the screen. Like picture matching,

picture naming involves lexical access, but also includes
a production component. Time from stimulus onset to
onset of verbal response was the RT. Response onset was
detected when the input from a headworn microphone
passed a threshold amplitude. The names of the pictures
varied in frequency of occurrence in English; the three

conditions were high, medium, and low frequency, with
eight trials in each condition. High-frequency words had
simple frequencies of between 132 and 288 in the thirdgrade corpus of Carroll, Davies, and Richman (1971).
Medium-frequency words were between 36 and 81, and
low-frequency words ranged from 1 to 24.

presented for each sentence type. In the other grammar
task, grammaticality judgment, the child judged whether
an auditorily presented sentence was "good" or "bad." Half
of the sentences were grammatically correct; the incorrect sentences erred in one of three ways: subject-verb
agreement was incorrect, word order was incorrect, or a
preposition was omitted from an oblique argument. Six
correct and six incorrect sentences were presented for each
sentence type.
Two phonological tasks were given, which shared a
common structure. A picture appeared at the top of the
computer screen, followed, after 4 s, by a word presented
auditorily, a printed word at the bottom of the screen,
or a picture at the bottom of the screen. Each of these
conditions included 12 trials, for a total of 36 trials in
each task. In the judging rhymes task, the child judged
whether the second stimulus rhymed with the first. In
the judging initial consonants task, the child judged
whether the second stimulus began with the same sound
as the first.

Procedure
Data were collected, as part of a larger battery of
tests and experimental tasks, by examiners who visited
the child's home or school in a specially equipped van.
The tasks were divided into two sessions, which took a
total of 50-60 min to complete. Both sessions contained
one of each type of task: motor, nonlinguistic cognitive,
lexical, grammatical, and phonological. All children did
the tasks in the same order. Children were instructed to
always respond as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. A set of practice trials preceded each task.
The examiner repeated the practice trials as many times
as necessary to ensure that the child understood the task.
For all tasks in which the response was a keypress, children were instructed to rest their preferred hand on the
computer just below the keys to be used, which were
marked by colored dots. In addition to the practice items,
the mental rotation task included a brief introduction to
the nonsense figures used in the task. These were presented on cards, so that the examiner could show the child
what each figure looked like in its normal and mirrorimage versions and also rotate the figures to demonstrate
how they would appear in the task.

One grammatical task was truth-value judgment.
The child was shown a picture. After 2 s, a sentence was
presented auditorily while the picture remained visible.
The child judged whether the meaning of the sentence
matched the picture. There were three types of sentences:
simple active, simple passive, and active with a compound
subject noun phrase. Six matches and six mismatches were

Results
Prior to performing analyses, we eliminated two
types of RTs: (a) those from trials in which the response
was incorrect and (b) those less than 10 ms. The latter
were considered too short to be legitimate responses to
the stimuli. We refer to RTs in these two categories as unusable trials.

Mean RTs in each condition were then calculated
for each individual by averaging across trials within
condition, and outliers were removed, as is usual for RT
studies (e.g., Bowers, Vigliocco, Stadthagen-Gonzalez, &
Vinson, 1999; Kail, 1991b). Outlier trials were identified
within each condition for each individual. Low outliers
were defined as any RT less than 350 ms, except for the
motor tasks, in which shorter RTs were common, and the
picture naming task, in which 300 ms was the cutoff. Then,
any RT greater than twice the mean was identified as an
outlier. This procedure was repeated until there were no
outliers. Of usable, correct trials, the percentages excluded
as outliers across all participants and conditions were
NLD 1.8%, SLI 2.8%, and NLI 1.8%. The total percentages
of trials eliminated (unusable and outliers) were NLD 7%,
SLI 13%, and NLI 13%. The mean numbers of valid responses, those used to compute the RTs, are shown in
Appendix A, organized by group, task, and condition. Also
shown are mean RT values. Valid response data are not
shown for the tapping task, as there was only one instance
of missing data. In all analyses using RTs, if a child had
fewer than three valid RTs in one or more conditions of
a particular task, no mean was computed for that condition (i.e., the child was missing data for that condition). In
Appendix A, the number of children contributing data for
each condition is shown.

Accuracy
Accuracy of response was calculated as a proportion for each condition after excluding unusable trials
but before removing trials with outlier RTs. Accuracy
was not computed for the motor tasks, as there were
no correct or incorrect responses for those tasks. Group
means for each condition are shown in Appendix B. All
groups performed well above the level of chance (i.e., 50%)
throughout. ANOVAs were performed on the accuracy
data; an arcsin transformation was applied to the proportions of accurate responses. In five of the eight tasks,
there were significant ( p < .05) main effects for group.
The effects were of medium magnitude for mental rotation
(f = .31), judging grammaticality ( f = .26), judging rhymes
(f = .34), and judging initial consonants ( f = .33); for judging truth value, the effect size was small ( f = .12). Pairwise
comparisons were made using the unequal N HSD post
hoc test, with an alpha level of .05. The NLD group was
significantly more accurate than the NLI group on mental rotation, judging grammaticality, judging rhymes, and
judging initial consonants. The NLD group was significantly more accurate than the SLI group on judging grammaticality. The SLI group was significantly more accurate
than the NLI group on mental rotation. Although there
was a significant main effect for group on judging truth
value, none of the post hoc pairwise comparisons reached
significance.

Preliminary Analyses
Replicating analyses performed by Miller et al.
(2001), we fit the data from the 42 task conditions to
Equation 1, computing separate functions for the SLI and
NLI groups.
RTSLI=NLI 1/4 m  RTNLD

1

For the SLI group, R2 = .96; for the NLI group, R2 = .92.
The slowing coefficient, or slope, for the SLI group was
1.20. The 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.23, did not include 1, indicating that the children with SLI were significantly slower than their typically developing peers.
The slope for the NLI group was 1.26, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.20-1.31. Thus, the children with NLI
were also significantly slower than the NLD children.
The confidence intervals for the SLI and NLI groups overlapped. Scatterplots with regression lines are shown in
Figure 1. Reference lines with a slope of 1 are provided,
and confidence intervals are shown.
The method described previously is a Brinley function (Brinley, 1965), commonly used for comparing the
RTs of two groups across multiple elicitation conditions
and tasks. It has been demonstrated, however, that this
method is not appropriate for such comparisons; among
other problems, it does not account for the fact that experimental conditions are nested within tasks (e.g., Kail
& Salthouse, 1994; Sliwinksi & Hall, 1998; Windsor et al.,
2001). Furthermore, all of the data in the current study
came from a single sample of children. That is, in addition
to variance attributable to tasks, we must account for variance attributable to individual participants.
To deal with this issue, we adopted the following
approach. We modified Equation 1 and refit it for each individual in each of the three groups. These modifications
to Equation 1 are reflected in Equation 2 by the subscripts i, j, and k (i = 1 to nj , the number of subjects in
group j; j = NLD, SLI, and NLI; and k=motor, cognitive,
and language).

We fit Equation 2 with and without the intercept (bijk).
Also, when fitting Equation 2 for each individual i in the
NLD group, RTNLD,k was recomputed using all subjects
except subject i. This jackknife procedure was used for
individuals in the NLD group so that the mean slope
and intercept for the NLD group are not trivially 1 and
0, respectively. Thus, for each individual, the mean RT
for an experimental condition was computed by averaging across the trials in that condition, and these individual mean RTs were regressed against the means for the
NLD group as a whole. These person-level regression

equations were estimated, separately for the motor (6 conditions), cognitive (12 conditions), and language domains
(24 conditions), obtaining estimates for each individual
of the slope for each domain relative to the NLD group;
in other words, Brinley functions for the motor, cognitive,
and language domains were generated for each individual using Equation 2. The person-specific nature of
the Brinley function depicted by Equation 2 is apparent from the subscript i attached to the coefficient m.
Using Equation 2 to generate individual Brinley functions takes into account dependence of observations at
the individual level because the analysis returns a single
slope for the individual for each condition. In the next
step, the slope estimates for individuals were entered in
an ANOVA to assess the main effects of group and domain
on the mean slope of the Brinley functions, as well as the
interaction of these factors. At this second stage, slopes
for the same subject from the three domains are treated
as repeated measures.
As mentioned, Equation 2 was fit with and without
the intercept term. The specification of Equation 2 implies that the person-level intercept is the expected RT
in a domain for that person when mean RT for the NLD
group is 0. As such, the intercept of Equation 2 is a parameter estimated outside the bounds of the data and
does not reflect how fast or slow the individual is, on
average, relative to the NLD group. We compared the
results for estimating Equation 2 with and without the
intercept terms by examining the standard errors of
the slopes obtained from the two sets of estimations.
For each group and each domain, the square root of the
mean of the squared standard error was computed. In
this way, we could compare, for example, the mean slope
standard error for the SLI group in the motor domain
with and without an intercept term included in the
model. In each case, the mean standard error was smaller
when the intercept term was not included, ranging from
32% to 53% of the mean standard error of the model with
intercept. Average slopes by group and domain did not
vary substantially under the two approaches to fitting
Equation 2, but variability in slopes was considerably
greater when the intercept term was included in the
model. For comparison purposes, Figure 2 shows sideby-side boxplots of the distributions of the slope estimates under the two approaches. The slope estimates
used in the second stage were those obtained from the
zero-intercept model.
One objection to fitting Equation 2 at the person
level, and then using these slope estimates as dependent
variables in a second-stage analysis of group and domain
effects on the slopes, is that this two-stage approach does
not take into account differential precision in the individual slope estimates in the second-stage analysis.
Typically, one would want to give greater weight in the
second-stage analysis to those slopes that have been

720

estimated with greater precision. However, differential
precision is not a concern in the present case. Specifically,
the precision in the slope estimate for a given person in
a given domain is a function of two factors. The first factor is error variance, or the degree to which individual
mean RTs for an individual do not fall exactly on the regression line for that individual. As error variance increases, precision in the slope estimate decreases. The
second factor is variability in the predictor values; as
variability in the predictor values increases, precision
in the slope estimate also increases. To the extent that
these factors differ from one individual to the next, so
too will the precision in the slope estimates vary from
one individual to another. However, the first of these two
factors (error variance) is typically assumed to be the
same across individuals, and, in fact, would be estimated
by pooling information across individuals. Differences
across individuals in the estimate of error variance are
typically considered to be error, and are averaged out by
pooling across individuals to obtain a single estimate of
error variance or, at worst, a separate estimate of error
variance for each group of subjects. Error variance is
never considered to be person specific (i.e., different for
each individual subject).
The second factor affecting precision in the slope
estimates, variance in the predictor values, corresponds
to variability in the NLD mean RTs across the different
conditions within a given domain. Because the NLD
mean RTs are the same for all individuals in the NLI and
SLI groups, except to the extent that individual subjects
were not observed in some conditions, this factor, too, is
the same for all individuals in both the NLI and SLI
groups. Thus, differences in slope precision across individuals in the study are minor, reflecting the fact
that a handful of individuals were not observed in all
conditions. In fact, examination of the variance in the
predictor values across individuals within each group
showed that for the SLI group in the language domain, 4
of 20 cases had values that differed from the remainder
of the group. For these 4 cases, the variance in the predictor values ranged from 96% to 97% of the variance for
cases that had maximum variability in the predictors.
One case in the SLI group had 86% of maximum variance in the cognitive domain. In the NLI group, 2 of
15 cases in the language domain did not have maximum
variance in the predictors (90%-99% of maximum); 5
of 15 cases in the cognitive domain did not have the
maximum variance, and in these cases the variance in
the predictors ranged from 66% to 90% of the maximum. Given these minor differences across cases, and
the small number of affected cases, differential weighting of the slopes in the second-level analysis would minimally affect the results; consequently, we opted to use
equal weighting for all cases. These minimal differences
across individuals also suggest that a multilevel approach

parameter, and slopes for zero-intercept models (third column). Boxplots show mean, mean  1 SD, and mean  1.96 x SD.

to the analysis would yield quite similar estimates of the
second-stage estimates. We opted for the two-stage approach over the multilevel approach because of the ease
of handling the three domains at the second stage, which
would have required a multivariate multilevel model.

RT Slowing by Group and Domain
The slope estimates for individuals, generated as
described previously, were entered into a mixed-model
ANOVA to assess the main effects of group and domain, as
well as the interaction of these factors. The main effect of
group was significant, F(2, 63) = 18.76, p < .0001; partial
h2 = .37. The mean slopes (and standard deviations) for the
NLD, SLI, and NLI groups, respectively, were 1.00 (0.17),
1.22 (0.24), and 1.29 (0.25). Post hoc analysis using the
Unequal N HSD test showed that the average slope of
the NLD group was significantly less than that of the SLI

group (p < .001) and the NLI group ( p < .001). The main
effect of domain did not reach significance, F(2, 126) = 2.92,
p < .06; partial h2 = .03. The mean slopes (and standard
deviations) for the motor, cognitive, and language domains,
respectively, were 1.17 (0.21), 1.20 (0.26), and 1.13 (0.15).
Although the domain effect did not reach significance at
the .05 level, given the research questions about domain
differences, planned comparisons were performed. The
means and standard deviations by group and domain
are shown in Table 3. For the NLD and SLI groups,
there were no significant differences between the domains
(a = .05). For the NLI group, the cognitive domain differed
significantly from the language domain ( p < .01). The
cognitive-motor difference was marginal ( p = .08), and
the language-motor difference was not significant ( p > .13).
The Group x Domain interaction did not reach significance, F(4, 126) = 2.07, p < .09; partial h2 = .02, based
on the univariate approach to repeated measures, which

was deemed appropriate given that the sphericity assumption was not violated according to the Mauchley
test. Planned comparisons were performed to test for
group differences in each domain (see Table 3 for means
and standard deviations). For each of the three domains,
the NLD group differed significantly from the SLI and
NLI groups (all ps < .01), but the SLI and NLI groups did
not differ from one another.
Given that slowing is similar across domains, it is
possible that the slowing in the language and cognitive
domains can be accounted for by perceptual-motor factors. To test this possibility, we performed an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA), with the slopes for the language
and cognitive domains as the repeated measures dependent variable and the slope for the motor domain as the
covariate. A significant main effect of group was found,
F(2, 62) = 4.81, p < .02; partial h2 = .13, suggesting that
perceptual-motor factors are not entirely responsible for
the observed group differences in the language and cognitive domains. Post hoc analysis using the unequal N
HSD test showed that the average slope of the NLD group
was significantly less than that of the SLI group ( p < .001)
and the NLI group ( p < .001), but the SLI and NLI groups
did not differ. The main effect of domain was significant in
the ANCOVA, with F(1, 62) = 5.48, p < .03; partial h2 = .08.
Planned comparisons of the domains within groups indicated that the main effect was due to the greater slope
in the cognitive domain for the NLI group ( p < .02). As in
the ANOVA, the Group x Domain interaction did not reach
significance, F(2, 62) = 2.46, p < .10; partial h2 = .07.
The children with SLI and NLI were, on average,
slower than the NLD children. However, there were a
few children in each group that were not significantly
slower than the NLD average. Figure 3 shows the distribution of slopes for the children in the SLI and NLI
groups for each domain. On the basis of the individually
determined 95% confidence intervals, 7 children with SLI
had slopes 1 for motor tasks, 7 for cognitive tasks, and
6 for language tasks. For the NLI group, the corresponding numbers were 5, 5, and 4.
Prediction of RT from age 9 to age 14. To assess the
degree to which RT at an earlier age predicted RT 5 years
later, we computed correlations between RT at age 9
and at age 14. First, the RTs within each condition were
standardized on the mean for that condition including

722

all participants. These z scores were averaged across conditions to yield four summary scores: an overall z score
(mean of all 42 conditions), a linguistic z score (mean of
24 linguistic task conditions), a motor z score (mean of
6 task conditions of the tapping and simple RT tasks), and
a cognitive z score (mean of 12 conditions of the visual
search and mental rotation tasks). The correlations for
each of these scores from age 9 to 14 are summarized by
group in Table 4. All correlations for the SLI group were
moderate and significant. For the NLI group, only the
correlation for the cognitive tasks was not significant,
and it was markedly lower than the other correlations.
For the NLD group, only the correlation for the motor
tasks was not significant. The NLI group had a higher

correlation than the other groups for the language tasks.
Significant differences were found for the NLI-NLD comparison (z = 2.34, p < .01) and the NLI-SLI comparison
(z = 1.87, p < .05). The NLD group appeared to have a
lower correlation than the other groups for the motor tasks,
but the differences were not significant at the .05 level.
Correlations between ages 9 and 14 were also computed using slopes as the dependent measure. Slopes
for age 14 were computed as described earlier; slopes for
age 9 were computed by comparing each group to the
NLD group based on second-grade diagnosis. As shown
in Table 5, the pattern of correlations was similar to that
found for z scores. Significant associations were found
for all groups when all tasks were taken together, for all
three domains for the SLI group, and for the NLI group
on the language tasks, which was the largest correlation.
Several of the correlations for slopes were smaller in magnitude than the corresponding correlations for RTs; this
difference was probably due to reduced reliability of slope
estimation relative to estimation of means.
We also computed the correlations among domains
separately for ages 9 and 14. These correlations are shown
in Table 6. At both ages, only the children with SLI had
significant correlations for all pairings of the three domains. The correlation between the cognitive and language domains was also significant at both ages for the
NLD and NLI groups.

Discussion
The first question addressed by this study was
whether children with language impairment, who were
slower than typically developing peers at age 9, continued to be slower at age 14. Children with SLI and children with NLI were, on average, slower than NLD peers
across the motor, cognitive, and language domains. This
result suggests that in early adolescence, relatively slow
RTs continue to be characteristic of children with SLI
and NLI as a group. The slowness cannot be attributed
entirely to perceptual-motor factors. The second research
question was whether the slowing was similar across the
motor, cognitive, and language domains. No significant
difference was found between the domains; that is, the
average of individuals' speed relative to the NLD group
did not differ noticeably for motor, cognitive, and language tasks. However, comparisons of domains within
groups suggested that for the NLI group, RTs in the cognitive domain were slower than for language tasks. Another way to compare across domains is to examine the
intercorrelations among them. The results of these correlations (see Table 6) suggest that an individual's RT
relative to his or her group was not necessarily the same
for all domains. Children with SLI appeared to be consistent across domains; for all groups, the cognitive and
language domains were more closely related to each other
than to the motor domain.
The third research question was whether children
with SLI and NLI differed in the degree of slowing across
domains. The Group x Domain interaction was not significant, and pairwise comparisons showed that the mean
slopes of the SLI and NLI groups did not differ for any of
the domains, although both groups differed significantly
from the NLD group. As noted previously, however, the
NLI group showed slower RTs for cognitive than for language tasks.

Our fourth research question was whether RT performance at age 9 predicted performance at age 14; that
is, did children who were relatively fast (or slow) at age 9
retain their standing in the sample at age 14? Taking
all tasks together, we found moderate, significant correlations between RTs at age 9 and age 14 for all three
groups (NLD, SLI, and NLI). We also computed correlations separately for the task domains (motor, nonverbal
cognitive, and linguistic). Correlations were significant
and moderate to high on language tasks for all three
groups, moderate and significant on motor tasks for the
SLI and NLI groups, and moderate and significant on
cognitive tasks for NLD and SLI groups. When using
slopes rather than RTs in the correlations, we found
significant correlations for the SLI group in all three
domains and for the NLI group in the language domain.
Correlations of moderate magnitude that did not reach
significance were found for the NLD group on language
and cognitive tasks and for the NLI group on motor tasks.
With data from only two points in time, we cannot
reliably estimate a developmental function. Although
RT at age 9 has some predictive value for RT 5 years
later, clearly other factors are also at work, as evidenced
by the moderate correlations and by the fact that a few
children with LI are not slower than NLD peers. One
limitation of this study is the classification of individuals
into diagnostic categories. Future studies could examine
individual differences in language ability or performance
IQ and relate these variables to RT and to change in RT
(see Lahey, Edwards, & Munson, 2001).
In the introduction, we presented evidence suggesting that there might be domain differences in the RT
slowing of adolescents with SLI and NLI. Our analyses
did not detect such differences for children with SLI,
but the cognitive domain was found to be relatively slow
in children with NLI, suggesting that the relationship
of performance IQ to processing speed requires investigation. Also, research is needed in which tasks are carefully chosen for the processes and knowledge that they
require, and difficulty is equated across task domains. In
the current study, the motor tasks yielded much shorter
RTs than any of the cognitive and language tasks, making
cross-domain comparison somewhat difficult to interpret.
Like their typically developing peers, children with
SLI and NLI become faster at performing speeded tasks
as they grow older, yet in early adolescence, many of
them are still slower than their peers on a wide range
of tasks, including some that do not require linguistic
knowledge. Our data support the conclusion of Kohnert
and Windsor (2004), that "response speed on basic nonlinguistic processing tasks may hold significant clinical
promise" (p. 901) for assessment of language impairment.
To fulfill that promise, future investigations must determine why and under what circumstances children with
LI are slow processors of information.
