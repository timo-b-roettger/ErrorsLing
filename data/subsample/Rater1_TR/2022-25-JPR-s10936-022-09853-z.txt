Abstract
This study provides a preliminary validation of a Greek Sentence Repetition Task (SRT)
with a sample of 110 monolingual and bilingual typically developing (TLD) children
and examines the test's ability to distinguish between Greek monolingual children and
age-matched Albanian-Greek bilinguals using a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
analysis. This is the first study to report on the psychometric evaluation of a Greek SRT
and its discriminatory ability with typical populations. Since most language assessments
are standardized with monolinguals and bilingual children tend to underperform on these
compared to monolinguals, it is essential to establish the level of bilingual TLD children's
ability on the same tests before moving on to diagnose language impairment in bilinguals.
Results showed that the Greek SRT had very high validity and reliability scores, with
Accuracy measures being more reliable than Grammaticality measures. The school-age
monolingual and bilingual TLD children reached different cut-off scores on this task.

Introduction
Sentence repetition tasks (SRTs) have been long used in research and clinical practice with
monolingual children with typical language development (TLD) (Armon-Lotem, 2014;
Komeili & Marshall, 2013), as well as with monolingual and bilingual children with language impairment as a measure of their morphosyntactic ability (For monolingual children
see: Archibald & Joanisse, 2009; Conti-Ramsden et al., 2001; Riches, 2012; Seeff-Gabriel
et al., 2010; Armon-Lotem, 2014. For bilingual children see: Armon-Lotem & Meir, 2016;
Ebert, 2014; Fleckstein et al., 2018; Grimm & Schulz, 2014; Pena et al., 2018, Thordardottir & Brandeker, 2013). However, studies examining the use of SRTs with bilingual TLD
children are limited (Marinis & Armon-Lotem, 2015; Kaltsa et al., 2020; Author D et al.,
2016). Establishing how bilingual TLD children perform on language assessments is impor-

tant, as bilingual children may exhibit delays in their developmental trajectory compared to
their monolingual TLD peers, or to reach language scores on language assessment similar
to those of children with atypical language development (see Marinis et al., 2017 for a
recent review). Specifically, bilingual TLD children, especially those with a late age of
onset (AoO) and limited exposure to the second language (L2), show lower performance
than their monolingual TLD peers on grammatical assessments (Author C & Marinis, 2011;
Kaltsa et al., 2020; Paradis, 2011; Unsworth et al., 2014), compromised vocabulary range
and size (Bialystok et al. 2010; Bialystok & Luk, 2012), difficulties in reading comprehension (August & Shanahan, 2006), delays in sentence (Jiang, 2004) and syntactic processing
(Marinis & Saddy, 2013), as well as pragmatic deficits (Comeau et al., 2010). Apart from
AoO and language exposure, other factors also modulate bilingual language development.
These may be child-specific factors, such as the child's proficiency in the first language (L1)
and L2 as well as their immersion in the L2, linguistic factors, such as the characteristics
and the similarity between the L1 and the L2, or factors related to the educational, linguistic
and Socio Economic Status (SES) background of parents (see Alanis, 2000; August & Shanahan, 2006; Bradley & Corwyn, 2002; Conteh, 2006; De Houwer, 2007; Goldberg et al.,
2008; Grosjean, 2009; Hermanto et al., 2012; La Morgia, 2011; Padilla & Gonzalez, 2001;
Paradis, 2011; Qi et al., 2006). Differences between monolingual and bilingual children in
language skills become less pronounced, when bilingual children are exposed to sufficient
oral and written input (De Temple & Snow, 2003; Hoff et al., 2014; Author A et al., 2019).
What this means is that bilingual TLD children may be identified as at risk of having language impairment, while in fact they only lag behind their monolingual peers and need more
time to catch up, which is normal in bilingual language development. This can have serious
consequences on their school life, academic achievement, and vocational prospects.
Against this background, a large body of research has attempted to disentangle effects of
bilingualism from those of language impairment and identify clinical markers for bilingual
children with language disorders (see for example Armon-Lotem, 2017; Gillam et al., 2013;
Meir & Armon-Lotem, 2013; Meir et al., 2016). To do so, however, one would first need to
establish what the level of ability in bilingual TLD children is in the first place, before they
are able to identify language impairment in bilingual populations. To this end, bilingual
normative data has been developed and investigated across languages and using different
tasks. Most of these tasks target bilingual children's vocabulary skills in English-speaking
contexts. Examples of this are the work by Brownell, (2000a, 2000b) with Spanish-English
bilingual children, the third edition of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III; Dunn
& Dunn, 1997), which included three major bilingual American English-speaking groups
within the normative sample, controlling for their percentage of representation amongst
the total population, or the second edition of the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (Dunn et
al., 1997) with norms for children with English as an L2, something, though, not attempted
in the third edition of the test (Dunn et al., 2009). Mueller Gathercole et al., (2008) also
developed a normed vocabulary test for Welsh-English bilingual children with English as
an L2 taking children's home language use into account. Kohnert et al. (1998) provided
preliminary normative bilingual data by administering the Boston Naming Test to 100 bilinguals in Spanish and English and found that the bilingual children scored lower than the
monolingual controls and that bilingual performance was significantly better on the English
than on the Spanish items, reflecting the fact that Spanish was the home language and English was the language of instruction. Rosselli et al. (2010) reported preliminary normative

375

data for bilingual Spanish-English children (5-14 years) on a neuropsychological battery by
testing 108 bilinguals and found that the bilingual group performed lower than the monolingual norms in the language subtests. Finally, the Bilingual English Language Assessment
(BESA) tool (Pena et al., 2018) is one of the few assessments to target different language
domains, such as phonology, morpho-syntax, semantics and pragmatics in both languages
of the Spanish-English bilinguals and to present bilingual norms for each domain. Given
that most work has focused on bilinguals with English as an L2, norms for other languages
and cultural contexts are necessary for the assessment of bilingual populations worldwide,
yet currently sparse (see also the discussion in Marinis et al., 2017). The present study
extends this line of practice and addresses this gap by establishing cut-off scores for typically developing bilingual Albanian-Greek children.

SRT as a measure of grammatical abilities in monolingual and bilingual
children
SRTs allow us to measure the grammatical abilities of participants in a comprehensive way
(Klem et al., 2015, however, see Polienka et al., 2015 on an analysis that SRTs measure
the interaction of working memory and language abilities). In this respect, using SRTs can
help us better understand how bilingual and monolingual TLD children perform on this
grammatical measure, and identify the linguistic characteristics that uniquely identify bilingual TLD children in comparison to their monolingual peers.
Studies examining SRT performance have investigated typologically different languages
and distinct structural properties. For example, Chiat et al. (2013) compared monolingual
and bilingual children in various language pairs (Russian-Hebrew, English-Hebrew, Russian-German, and Turkish-English) with the use of standardized SRTs targeting structures
of different complexity in the bilinguals' L2 (Hebrew German and English). Results were
mixed. Bilingual children with Russian and English as their L1 performed as accurate as
monolinguals in L2 Hebrew, while 40% of the L1 Russian children and all L1 Turkish
children were significantly less accurate than their monolingual English-speaking peers.
Importantly, their performance on the English SRT classified them as being at risk for Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Komeili & Marshall, (2013) reported a monolingual
advantage comparing monolingual and bilingual Farsi-English TLD children on the English
School-Age Sentence Imitation Test-English 32 (SASIT-E32) (Marinis et al., 2011), as the
bilingual Farsi-English children exhibited significantly lower performance than monolingual English-speaking peers. Another study reporting better performance for monolinguals
is that of Semel et al., (2000) which examined monolingual English-speaking children and
sequential bilingual Turkish-English children on the Sentence Recall Subtest from CELF-3,
standardized with British English (Semel et al. 1995). The results showed that monolinguals
outperformed bilinguals, and that almost 70% of the bilingual children scored significantly
below monolingual norms. However, there is also some limited evidence that bilingual and
monolingual children do not differ on SRT measures. One such example is Grimm's (2003)
study which examined pre-school German monolingual and sequential Russian-German
bilingual children using an SRT in German which involved items of varying complexity
(simple and bi-clausal items with subordination). The results showed that two-thirds of the

13

376

bilingual children, who also had sufficient exposure to the L2, performed either within or
above monolingual norms.
Turning to Greek, Kaltsa et al. (2020) and Andreou et al. (2021) compared monolingual
and bilingual school-age children using the same SRT measure as the one we validated
in the present study and reported a monolingual advantage. Monolingual children outperformed bilingual children in terms of accuracy, but not on the grammaticality measures of
the task. However, these two studies merely reported differences between the monolingual
and the bilingual groups on the SRT and did not carry out an in-depth validation of the task,
as we did in the present study.
In sum, it has been shown that bilingual TLD children tend to score below monolingual
peers on SRTs, and similar findings have been reported for Greek. However, significant
between-group differences are not enough to characterize a task, in this case an SRT, as an
accurate tool for clinical or educational practice (see Plante & Vance, 1994 on the methodology on impairment detection). Currently, there are no validated and standardized SRT
measures which would allow us to establish cut-off scores for Greek-speaking monolingual
and bilingual TLD populations separately. This is despite the increasingly frequent use of
the specific task that we examined in this study. The frequent use of this test is an additional
reason for the examination of its psychometric properties. Another reason is the fact that it
allows us to examine a variety of morpho-syntactic properties in Greek, as will be discussed
in its presentation. We return to the issue of SRT validation in the next section before we
present our study. Validity measures examine whether an instrument tests what it sets out to
test, while reliability measures examine whether an instrument consistently yields the same
results if it is used on repeated occasions (Heale & Twycross, 2015).

SRT as a clinical tool
SRTs have been extensively used in validation studies as a means of diagnosing language
impairment, particularly, SLI or Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) (Bishop, 2017)
(see for example Conti-Ramsden et al., 2001; Leclercq et al., 2014; Petruccelli et al., 2012;
Poll et al., 2010; Stokes et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2014; Theodorou, et al., 2017). However,
only some of the SRTs used to assess the language abilities of children are standardized
despite their good ability to discriminate between typical and atypical groups (see ContiRamsden et al., 2001; Fitton et al., 2019; Marinis & Armon-Lotem, 2015). For example, the
standardized Sentence Recall Subtest of the CELF-3 (Semel et al., 1995) was reported to
have a 90% specificity (i.e., test accuracy in detecting true positive cases) and 85% validity, much higher compared to other tasks (non-word repetition) in the diagnosis of SLI
(Conti-Ramsden et al., 2001). Additionally, most standardized SRTs have been developed
in English-speaking countries (in the USA or the UK), and apart from a few exceptions,
they do not offer norms for bilingual children. The validity and discriminatory ability of the
test with TLD populations, that is bilinguals against monolinguals, is still not adequately
investigated, even though this kind of validation and norming constitutes an important step
in solving the problem of teasing apart the effects of bilingualism from those of language
impairment.
In addition, it is crucial to examine the test's validity with typologically different languages, as the task's discriminatory strength may be modulated by the morphosyntactic

377

properties of the target language. To our knowledge, there is no previous research on the
psychomentric evaluation of SRTs for Greek, despite the growing use of SRTs with different Greek-speaking populations (Andreou et al., 2021; Makrodimitris & Schulz, 2021;
Theodorou et al., 2017). One exception is the study by Theodorou and colleagues (2017),
which examined the diagnostic ability of a Cypriot Greek SRT in Greek-Cypriot settings
with bilectal Cypriot-Greek TLD children and children with DLD. The authors showed that
the task effectively discriminated between the two groups.
The present work can serve as the first step towards providing normative SRT data for the
large bilingual group of Albanian-Greek bilingual school-age children in Greece (https://
eacea.ec.europa.eu/national-policies/eurydice/content/population-demographic-situationlanguages-and-religions-33_el). We examined the test's validity and reliability, as well as
its discriminatory ability via the estimation of cut-off scores between monolinguals and
bilinguals, a line of investigation that can lay the ground for a full standardization of the
tool. The SRT that this study evaluates was introduced in a previous work of our research
team (Andreou et al., 2021, Kaltsa et al., 2020). This work aimed at investigating the effect
of input, lexical skills and cognitive mechanisms on bilingual morpho-syntactic abilities,
measured by the Greek SRT. The goals of the present study differ from the goals and the
results reported by the previous studies, since, these studies, unlike the present one, did not
examine the psychometric potential of the SRT, namely the validity, reliability, and discriminatory ability of the test. Such an analysis is crucial for understanding the potential of the
new instrument and the interpretation of any results obtained when administered to different
groups. Finally, the samples used in the previous studies comprised sixty 8-10-year-old
children (20 monolingual, 20 simultaneous and 20 late sequential bilinguals) in the Kaltsa
et al. (2020) study and two groups of 35 monolinguals and bilinguals aged 8-12 years old
in the Andreou et al. study (2021). Our sample consists of 110 (57 bilingual and 53 monolingual children) other than the ones used in the previous studies. Therefore, while the SRT
which we discuss in the present study is the same SRT we used in our previous work, there
are two crucial differences: first, the aim of the present work is completely different, that is
to offer a preliminary validation of the instrument not investigated in the previous Kaltsa et
al. (2020) study, and, second, this validation is performed via the investigation of a different
and larger sample.
Considering all the above, the aim of this paper is twofold: first, we wanted to evaluate the validity and reliability of a Greek SRT used with TLD children, and second, we
examined the test's ability to distinguish between Greek-speaking children and age-matched
bilingual TLD children whose L2 is Greek. The cut-off scores for TLD bilingual children
that this analysis produced could function as a benchmark against which bilingual impaired
language performance can be compared. In other words, knowing the range within which
the SRT performance of TLD bilinguals falls, is a necessary step for the assessment of
language impairment in bilinguals. This study contributes to our understanding of bilingual
language development by adding to the growing body of validated tests that measure bilingual language skills in new cultural and linguistic contexts (Greek-Albanian). By keeping
the L1 of our participants constant (i.e., Albanian), we could establish more clearly how the
Greek SRT works for this specific population of bilingual children who comprise a large
immigrant group in Greece today. The novelty of this study lies in: (a) the validation of a
new SRT for Greek, something not investigated before, (b) the psychometric evaluation of

13

378

the SRT with typical populations, and (c) the examination of the test's discriminatory ability
by the estimation of cut-off scores.

Method
Participants
All children resided in Greece and were recruited from monolingual Greek state schools in
Epirus, Northwest Greece. The research was approved by the National Institute of Education which granted the researchers access to the schools. Participant inclusion criteria were
absence of learning disabilities for both monolingual and bilingual children, and, for the
bilingual group, a threshold of language skills in Albanian, namely receptive skills in daily
conversation, to ensure that the group was bilingual. To exclude children with learning difficulties, we examined student and school records. Additionally, none of the participants
received any support that children with diagnosed learning difficulties can receive in Greek
state schools. Specifically, none of the children either attended a special integration class or
received one-to-one teacher support within the mainstream class. Participation in the study
was voluntary, and only after a signed informed consent from the child's parent or caregiver.
From the 110 child participants, 53 participants were monolingual Greek-speaking children,
while the remaining 57 were Albanian-Greek bilingual children. 63 of the participants were
boys and 47 were girls. The monolingual group had a mean age of 9.87 years (SD = 1.3) and
the bilingual group had a mean age of 9.9 years (SD = 1.09) with an age range from 8 to 12
years old. The profile of the bilingual children, as this was detailed by means of an extensive
background questionnaire (Mattheoudakis et al., 2016) is presented in Table 1.
The mean AoO to Greek was 1 years;9 months, while the mean length of exposure was
around 7 years, suggesting that the children were early sequential bilinguals with extensive exposure to Greek. With respect their input/ output and communicative skills, while
their current use of the two languages (i.e. daily oral activities like interaction with fam-

ily members/friends, telling the time, watching TV/movies) and home language use (language use at the preschool age) were similar across the two languages, bilinguals reported
that they significantly preferred to use Greek than Albanian in their daily writing/reading
tasks (for example writing lists/letters/cards, reading aloud, texting, emailing, visiting websites, video-gaming, book/magazine reading) (p < 0.01), and most of them were not literate
in Albanian. SES as measured by parental education indicated that children belonged to
low-to-mid SES families, as most parents had completed compulsory secondary education (cf. Armon-Lotem et al., 2011). Monolingual children's SES was calculated at 4 indicating mid-to-high parental educational level. Additionally, monolinguals and bilinguals
had matching and age-appropriate cognitive skills as measured by a battery of cognitive
tasks targeting non-verbal intelligence and verbal working memory. Specifically, in the
Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices Task (Raven et al., 1998) (max. score = 36) which
measures non-verbal intelligence all participants achieved age-appropriate scores [overall mean score: 28.4/36 (78.9%, SD = 8.4)], while no differences were detected between
bilinguals and monolinguals [monolinguals: 29.5/36 (82%, SD = 7.2), bilinguals: 27.2/36
(75.5%, SD = 9.5), t (108) = 1.7, p > 0.05]. In the verbal working memory task, namely the
Digit Backwards Span Task (Alloway, 2007) (max. score = 36) monolingual and bilingual
scores were also comparable [monolinguals: 24.1/36 (66.9%, SD = 9.4) bilinguals: 26.4/36
(73.3%, SD = 11.3), (t(108) = 1.4, p > 0.05]. Moreover, we used an expressive vocabulary test
as a general measure of language proficiency, a common practice in bilingualism research
(see for example Unsworth et al. 2014). The results on a 50-item expressive vocabulary task
(Vogindroukas et al., 2009), which is a standardized in Greek version of the Renfrew WordFinding Vocabulary Test (Renfrew, 1995), were calculated at 36.8/50 (73.6%, SD = 5.6) for
the bilingual group, and at 42.1/50 (84.2%, SD = 4.5) for the monolingual group with this
difference being statistically significant [t(108) = 2.7, p < 0.05].

Materials: The SRT
The Greek SRT used in the present study was developed within the COST Action IS0804
and aimed at capturing the linguistic ability and differences between TLD and language
impaired children and has been used in previous studies reporting differences between
monolingual and bilingual children (Andreou et al., 2021; Kaltsa et al., 2020). For the
design of this task, we followed the guidelines outlined in Marinis and Armon-Lotem
(2015), as follows: (a) inclusion of syntactically complex structures that pose acquisitional
problems cross-linguistically (e.g. structures that involve movement or constituent displacement, such as wh-questions and relative clauses) along with syntactically simpler structures
(e.g. SVO, coordination structures,) (b) inclusion of language-specific structures that pose
acquisitional problems (i.e. object clitic structures in Greek), and (c) control for sentence
length (mono-clausal and bi-clausal) and word frequency. Given the above, and considering the morphosyntactic properties of the languages of our bilingual participants, namely
Greek and Albanian as well as the differences in morphosyntactic development in bilingual
and monolingual children (for a detailed discussion see Kaltsa et al. 2020), the Greek SRT
comprised eight different structures: (a) Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentences, (b) finite
and non-finite negation structures, (NEG), (c) structures with clitics in clitic left dislocation
(CLLD) and clitic doubling (CD) contexts, (d) complement clauses (COMPLCL) introduced with the complementizes "oti" and "pu", (e) coordinated sentences (COORD), (f)

Albanian, like Greek, is a morphologically rich language with flexible word order. Nouns
are inflected for number and case, while verbs for person and number. Additionally, all the
structures used in the Greek SRT exist in Albanian too (albeit may formed differently in
some cases) except for Clitic Left Dislocation (CLLD), since Albanian only exhibits Clitic
Doubling (CD) (Demiraj et al., 2002).

Procedure and Scoring
Children were tested individually in a quiet room at their schools. Each participant sat in
front of a computer screen and listened to the sentences via headphones. The SRT was
presented as a treasure hunt game to be more attractive for the children. In a Power Point
presentation, a bear was moving to various locations in search of a hidden treasure. For the
bear to move, the child had to repeat the sentences presented to him/her. All sentences were
recorded by a female native speaker of Greek and had normal intonation. The children were
asked to repeat each sentence as accurately as possible. Their responses were recorded and
later orthographically transcribed.
Our scoring procedure involved two levels: Accuracy scoring and Grammaticality scoring. First, for overall Accuracy (i.e., Accuracy Measure), children's performance was scored
following the scoring procedure of the sentence repetition subtest of the Clinical Evaluation
of Language Fundamentals (fourth edition) (CELF-4; Semel et al., 2003) and Marinis and
Armon-Lotem (2015) COST scoring protocols. A score of 3 was given, if the participants
produced a verbatim repetition of the sentence they heard, a score of 2 was awarded, if
participant utterances involved one error (grammatical or lexical but not phonological), a
score of 1, if their utterances involved two errors, and a score of 0, if their utterance involved
three errors or more. Since every structure in the SRT was represented by 4 sentences, the
accuracy scoring scale for each structure was from 0 to 12, making a total of 0-96 for each
participant. Second, regarding the Grammaticality scoring (i.e., Grammaticality Measure),
responses were scored with respect to whether they were grammatically correct or not, irrespective of how close they were to the original sentence. A score of 1 was given for every
grammatical utterance, while no scores were given for ungrammatical ones. Since every
structure in the SRT was represented by 4 sentences, the grammaticality scoring scale for
each structure was from 0 to 4, making a total of 0-32 per participant.

Statistical Analysis
The SPSS statistical software (version 19.0, Armonk, NY) was used for the data analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were performed in order to examine the distribution of the experimental variables. The comparison between monolinguals
and bilinguals on overall Accuracy and Grammaticality scores was calculated by means of
One-way ANOVA. To investigate whether Accuracy and Grammaticality was modulated by
the different structures (SVO = Subject-Verb agreement; NEG = Negation, CD/CLLD = clitic

doubling/ clitic left dislocation, COMPL CL = Complement clause, COORD = Coordination,
ADV CL = Adverbial clause, WHQ = Wh-question, RC = Relative clause) in the two groups
(Bilingual, Monolingual) we ran a repeated measures ANOVA. Adjustments for multiple
comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni correction. The internal consistency of
the SRT test, that is the test's validity and reliability, was computed using a Cronbach's
alpha coefficient and a split-half reliability coefficient technique. Cronbach's Internal consistency measure refers the extent to which all the items in a test measure the same concept,
while reliability describes the amount of measurement error in a test. Cronbach's alpha is
expressed as a number between 0 and 1 with the acceptable values ranging from 0.70 to 0.95
(see for example Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Although there is no consensus regarding
the highest acceptable value (see Bland & Altman, 1997), very high values may indicate
redundancy of items in a test. For this reason, Streiner, (2003) and (Tavakol & Dennick,
2011) recommend a value of no higher than 0.90 as an index of internal consistency. Additionally, a ROC analysis was conducted in order to estimate the cut-off values of the SRT
total scores and to evaluate the ability of the test to discriminate between monolinguals and
bilinguals. Sensitivity and specificity values between 80% and 89% are considered fair,
while rates above 90% are good (Plante & Vance, 1994). Optimal cut-off values that best
discriminate between monolingual and bilingual individuals can also be determined using
ROC curve analysis (Fan et al., 2006). In this analysis, the predictive accuracy of a test to
discriminate between bilingual and monolingual TLD children was measured by the area
under the curve (AUC). The AUC represents the overall accuracy of a test: an area of 1
indicates a perfect test; an area of 0.90-1 denotes excellent accuracy; an area of 0.80-0.90
good accuracy; an area of 0.70-0.80 fair accuracy; an area of 0.60-0.70 poor accuracy; and
an area below 0.60 indicates a worthless test (Author C & John, 2018).

Results
Monolingual--Bilingual Comparisons on the SRT
In terms of Accuracy and Grammaticality the monolingual TLD group had an overall score
of 87.43 (SD = 11.25) and 30.96 (SD = 2.2) respectively, while the bilingual TLD group had
a score of 64.89 (SD = 19.9) and 27.82 (SD = 4.42) respectively. Table 3 presents the relevant
data:
The analysis showed that there is a statistically significant difference in both measures with the monolinguals outperforming the bilinguals (Accuracy = F (1,161) = 85. 679,
p < 0.001; Grammaticality = F (1,161) = 36.765, p < 0.001).
Group mean scores in the different SRT structures or subdomains with respect to Accuracy are presented in Table 4; Fig. 1. Recall that the Accuracy scale is from 0 to 12 for each
structure.

The Accuracy by Group and Structure analysis yielded a main effect of Group (F
(1,161) = 87.346, p < 0.001) and Structure (F (7, 2427,8) = 30.112, p < 0.001), as well as a
significant interaction between the two (F (7, 2427,8) = 6.704, p < 0.001) (see also Fig. 1).
Post-hoc pairwise between-group comparisons revealed that the monolinguals were significantly more accurate than bilinguals across all eight structures (all ps < 0.001).
To unpack the interaction between Group and Structure and to examine in what way
the two groups performed differently on each structure, we conducted repeated measures
ANOVA for each group separately. In the bilingual group, the analysis showed a main effect
of Structure (F (7,6.074) = 16.379, p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the lowest scores were detected CLLD and in SVO structures with the CLLD structures differing
significantly from all other structures (ps < 0.05), while the SVO structures differed significantly from all other structures except for NEG and COMPL structures (ps < 0.05). In the

13

monolingual group, the analysis returned a main effect of Structure (F (7,5.234) = 9.467,
p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the lowest scores in monolinguals were also
attested in the CLLD and the SVO structures (ps < 0.05), however, in the NEG structures
monolinguals fared better with the third most problematic structure being ADV. Scores on
COMPL structures were significantly lower only when compared against scores in COORD
and WHQ structures (ps < 0.05).
Group mean scores in the different SRT structures/ subdomains with respect to Grammaticality are presented in Table 5. Recall that the Grammaticality scale is from 0 to 4 for
each structure.
The Grammaticality by Group and Structure analysis yielded a main effect of both Group
(F (1,161) = 42.461, p < 0.001) and Structure (F (7, 220,1) = 7.030, p < 0.001), as well as a
significant interaction between the two (F (7, 220,1) = 4.517, p < 0.05) (See Fig. 2).
Post-hoc analyses on the above scores revealed that in all structures, except for COORD
structures and ADV structures, the monolinguals were significantly more accurate than the

two groups performed alike (p > 0.05), while in the ADV structures, the bilinguals outperformed the monolinguals (p < 0.05).
To unpack the interaction between Group and Structure and, therefore, examine how
structures compare within each group, we conducted repeated measures ANOVA for each
group separately. In the bilingual group, the analysis showed a main effect of Structure (F
(7,5.841) = 4.637, p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the scores on the COORD
structure were significantly higher compared to scores in ADV, CLLD, COMPL, NEG and
RC (ps < 0.05) but not compared to SVO and WHQ structures. In the monolingual group,
on the other hand, no main effect of Structure was detected (F (7, 5.208) = 1.509, p < 0.05),
since participants had high performance across structures.

Test Validity and Internal Consistency
The Cronbach analysis showed that the overall estimated internal validity of the SRT was
excellent (alpha = 0.92). An additional analysis using the split-half reliability technique
also showed that the SRT was internally consistent (split-half reliability coefficient = 0.96).
Table 6 presents the scores of the Item-Total Correlations and Reliability Measures by SRT
structure for both the Accuracy and the Grammaticality measure, that is reliability measures
for all 16 SRT subdomains together (Accuracy Measure scores in the 8 different structures
of the test and Grammaticality Measure scores in the eight different 8 structures of the test).
As is shown in Table 6, the individual reliability measures in the 16 SRT subdomains
(eight structures - Grammaticality Measure and eight structures - Accuracy Measure) are
very high, since they range from 0.92 to 0.91, which shows that the internal consistency of
the test is excellent. Such high values may be expected given that all items target the same
construct, that is morpho-syntactic development in Greek, albeit with developmental differences across structures. However, since high values of alpha may indicate redundancy or
reduplication of test items (see Streiner 2016) these results suggest that a closer item analysis could lead to the development of a screener test with even fewer items. We will return
to this issue in the Discussion section. Note, however, that there is not a consensus regard-

ing the highest acceptable alpha value (see Bland & Altman, 1997) with some researchers
accepting even a 0.95 value in the evaluation of clinical instruments.
Next, we proceeded with examining the internal consistency of the test more rigorously
by performing analyses for the Accuracy and Grammaticality easures separately. The
Cronbach's Alpha for Accuracy measure was excellent (alpha = 0.95) with split-half reliability coefficient equal to 0.96. Additionally, the relevant scores for the SRT Grammatically
Measure were very good (alpha = 0.82) with split-half reliability coefficient equal to 0.795.
Next, we proceeded with breaking down these scores by structure for each Measure. Table 7
presents the scores of the Item-total Correlations and Reliability measures with respect to
the Accuracy Measure, while Table 8 presents the scores of the Item-total Correlations and
Reliability measures with respect to the Grammaticality Measure.
As is illustrated in Tables 7 and 8, the reliability measures in the eight SRT structures
with respect to Accuracy are very high ranging from 0.94 to 0.95. As previously discussed,
scores that high are anticipated given the nature of the test; however, they could show that
maybe the test could be reduced to create a screener instrument. On the other hand, the reli-

ability measures in the eight SRT structures with respect to Grammaticality are high, yet
lower than Accuracy scores ranging from 0.79 to 0.82.
Moving next to the discriminatory ability of the test, a ROC analysis was conducted
in order to examine if there is any statistically significant positive discrimination between
monolinguals and bilinguals with respect to the SRT Accuracy total score. The analysis
revealed a very high statistically significant positive discrimination between the monolingual and bilingual participants of our study [AUC: 0.85, p < 0.001] with the cut-off point
being equal to 68.50. Recall that the Accuracy scale is from 0 to 96. The relevant information is presented in Fig. 3.
Similarly, a separate ROC analysis was conducted in order to examine if there is any
statistically significant positive discrimination between the groups with respect to the SRT

tive discrimination between monolinguals and bilinguals [AUC: 0.803, p < 0.001] with the
cut-off point being equal to 31.50. Recall that the Grammaticality scale is 0-32. The relevant information is presented in Fig. 4.
Given the ROC results interpretation presented in the Analysis section, the ability of
the SRT to discriminate between bilingual and monolingual participants is good (see also
Author C & John, 2018).

Discussion
his study aimed to provide a preliminary validation of a Greek SRT used with TLD children, as well as to examine the test's ability to distinguish between monolingual Greekspeaking school-age children and bilingual Albanian-Greek TLD peers residing in Greece.
The unique identification of the linguistic characteristics of TLD bilingual children is crucial for discriminating typical from impaired language performance in bilinguals, and, ultimately, accurately diagnosing language impairment in this population. The study is novel
in the following ways: (a) it validated a Greek SRT, a line of research never investigated
before, given that there are few tests that target Greek, let alone validated, (b) it evaluated
the psychometric characteristics of an SRT with typical populations, and (c) it examined
the test's discriminatory ability to distinguish TLD monolingual children (Greek-speaking)
from TLD bilingual peers (Albanian- Greek).

Group Comparisons
Starting with the accuracy measure results, within-group performance on different structures revealed that while both groups performed the least accurately on CD/CLLD and in
SVO structures, monolinguals, unlike bilinguals, fared better in the NEG structures and in
the COMPL structures compared to the other structures of the SRT. These results show that
structures like CD/CLLD which involve high inflectional complexity are challenging for
children regardless of language background (see also Author C, 2008; Author D & Mastropavlou, 2008). The same explanation can be applied to the SVO sentences of the SRT,
since, although structurally simple, they involved complex NPs, adding to the inflectional
complexity of the sentence.  monolingual advantage in the SVO structures of the L1 SRT
was also reported in Meir et al.'s study (2016), a result also attributed to the difficulties that
bilingual children faced with inflectional complexity, particularly case morphology. For the
bilingual children, COMPLCL and NEG structures were also problematic, since the former
involve subordination with two different complemetizers (oti, pu) and the latter involve both
finite and non-finite negation.
Between-group comparisons revealed that monolinguals were significantly more accurate than bilinguals on the overall scores, as well as across all the eight structures tested. This
finding is in line with most of the previous relevant research which reports a monolingual
advantage in SRT tasks (Andreou et al., 2021; Chiat et al., 2013; Kaltsa et al., 2020; Komeili
& Marshall, 2013; Semel et al., 2000) and agrees with results showing that bilinguals may
lag behind monolinguals in language measures (August & Shanahan, 2006; Bialystok et
al., 2010; Author C & Marinis, 2011; Comeau et al., 2010; Jiang, 2004; Marinis & Saddy,
2013; Paradis, 2011; Unsworth et al., 2014). Turning next to the Grammaticality Measure,

13

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2022) 51:373-395

389

within-group comparisons in the different structure showed no differences in the monolingual group, while bilinguals were significantly more accurate in the COORD structures
compared to all other structures. This finding is not unexpected given that COORD structures were associated with high scores in both groups. Between-group comparisons showed
that the monolinguals did not outperform bilinguals in all the structures, since in COORD
structures the groups performed alike. Additionally, also considering the results of the Cronbach alpha analysis, Accuracy measures appeared to be more sensitive to group effects compared to Grammaticality measures, a finding also attested in previous research (Andreou et
al., 2021; Chiat et al., 2013; Grimm, 2003; Kaltsa, et al., 2020; Stokes et al., 2006).

Validity and Reliability of the Greek SRT
he analysis revealed that the test's overall internal consistency is excellent (Cronbach analysis, alpha = 0.922, split-half reliability technique coefficient = 0.96). Individual reliability
measures in the 16 SRT linguistic structures (eight structures - Grammaticality Measure and
eight structures - Accuracy Measure) were very high ranging from 0.92 to 0.91 showing that
the internal consistency of the test is excellent. These results are very high and even higher
than the specificity and reliability measures of the standardized Sentence Recall CELF-3 test
(Semel et al., 1995) which were calculated at 90% and 85% respectively (Conti-Ramsden
et al., 2001). When Accuracy and Grammaticality measures were teased apart and evaluated separately, the internal consistency analysis remained very good: Cronbach's Alpha
for the SRT Accuracy subdomains was excellent alpha = 0.95 with split-half reliability coefficient = 0.96. Cronbach's Alpha for the SRT Grammatically sub-score was fair (alpha = 0.82
with split-half reliability coefficient = 0.80). Specifically, the reliability measures in the eight
SRT structures with respect to Accuracy were very good, ranging from 0.94 to 0.95, while
the reliability measures in the 8 SRT structures with respect to Grammaticality were fair,
yet lower than Accuracy scores ranging from 0.79 to 0.082. The sensitivity and specificity
scores were better for the Accuracy than for the Grammaticality measure. These findings
corroborate results from between and within-group comparisons and are in line with previous research examining the same instrument which shows that accuracy measures are more
sensitive to group differences than grammaticality measures (Andreou et al., 2021; Kaltsa
et al., 2020). The effect of different scoring measures is something also attested previous
SRT validation work, albeit with atypical populations and different language pairs (see Theodorou et al., 2017).
Such high values of internal consistency are expected given that the items measured
morpho-syntactic development in Greek. However, these results suggest that a closer item
analysis could lead to the development of a screener test with even fewer items, especially
in the Accuracy measure, since high alpha values may indicate redundancy or reduplication of test items (Streiner, 2016). Although there is not a consensus regarding the highest
acceptable alpha value (see Bland & Altman, 1997), based on our data from the Accuracy
measures as well as on the pairwise within-group comparisons performed, we could suggest
the elimination of the COORD structures from the test. It is important to stress, however,
that the alpha value is a property of the scores on a test from a specific sample of testees
(see Tavakol & Dennick, 2011). Therefore, any suggestion should be viewed with caution
given that this is a preliminary validation procedure, with a sample of specific size and
characteristics.

Finally, data from the ROC analysis which evaluates the test's ability to distinguish
between our two TLD groups, revealed a very high positive discrimination for both the
Accuracy measure [AUC: 0.855, p < 0.001] and the Grammaticality measure [AUC: 0.803,
p < 0.001]. The cut-off point for the Accuracy measure was 68.50/ 96, while for the Grammaticality measure the cut-off point was 31.50/32. The interpretation of the cut-off scores is
that if, for example, an Albanian-Greek bilingual child scores 68 on the SRT Accuracy measure, he/she may fare lower than a monolingual child but may not be classified as language
impaired, since he/she achieves a normal level of bilingual performance, according to the
instrument validation data that we present.
Our results, show that, overall, the predictive accuracy of the SRT to discriminate
between bilingual and monolingual TLD participants is good (see Author C & John, 2018),
with the Accuracy measure being more effective than the Grammaticality one. Our findings
agree with previous research which shows the greater sensitivity of SRT accuracy measures
when testing Greek-speaking populations (Andreou et al., 2021; Kaltsa et al., 2020), which
is also manifested through the estimation of the relevant cut-off scores.

Conclusions
The validation of the Greek SRT investigated in this study showed that: (a) the test had
very high validity and reliability, with Accuracy being more sensitive than Grammaticality,
and (b) the test can be used to distinguish between school-age bilingual Albanian-Greek
TLD children residing in Greece and their monolingual Greek-speaking peers. This is the
first attempt to validate an SRT for Greek and examine its discriminatory ability with TLD
populations. The development of validated and standardized tests targeting bilingual and
monolingual typical and atypical populations is a crucial component of any intervention
program. Our contribution to this area is related to the evaluation of the validity of a newly
developed SRT for Greek, a language for which there is no relevant work. This is despite
the fact that SRTs are extensively used with bilingual populations as a measure of grammatical development. The calculation of cut-off scores can show the lower score that TLD
bilingual can achieve on this task. Importantly, this score indicates typical performance for
this population and is not related to pathology/impairment, which any intervention program
needs to consider.

Future Directions
The availability of validated tests in the Greek language along with an examination of the
factors that modulate bilingual language development (input, exposure to the language,
AoO) can help us profile bilingual children more efficiently, facilitating, thus, the design
and application of supportive and intervention language programs. Given the great effect of
input quantity and quality in the development of bilingual language abilities highlighted by
recent research (i.e., Author C & Marinis, 2011; Jia & Fuse, 2007; Unsworth et al., 2014) a
part of the designed inventions in typical or atypical populations could relate to the enhancement of oral and written language exposure. Further research on larger samples is necessary
to make stronger claims and proposals as regards the validation and standardization of tests

used with bilingual populations. Any larger scale analysis of the validation of the Greek
SRT test could involve atypical populations as well, so that researchers are able to calculate
cut-off scores for TDL monolingual, TDL bilingual and impaired bilingual chidden having
thus a clearer picture of the possibilities of the test.
