Purpose: In the 2nd decade of life, language skills expand in both quantitative and
qualitative ways. The etiology of these new skills and the relationships among them
have been little explored.
Method: Taking advantage of widespread access to inexpensive and fast Internet
connections in the United Kingdom, we administered four Web-based measures of
receptive language development--Vocabulary, Listening Grammar, Figurative
Language, and Making Inferences--to a sample of 12-year-old twin pairs (N = 4,892)
participating in the Twins Early Development Study ( TEDS; Oliver & Plomin, 2007).
Results: The 4 measures showed moderate phenotypic intercorrelation. All 4 showed
moderate genetic influence (a2 between .25 and .36) and low shared environmental
influence (c2 between .13 and .19). The median genetic correlation among the
4 measures was .87, indicating strong genetic overlap among them. A latent factor
score for Language, based on the common variance among the measures, showed
substantial genetic influence (a2 = .59) and moderate shared environmental influence
(c2 = .28). A small but significant sex difference favored females on the Listening
Grammar and Making Inferences tests, but there was no evidence for sex differences
in the etiology of any of the measures.
Conclusion: Despite the emergence of new skills at this developmental period, from
the etiological perspective, language skills remain relatively undifferentiated at an
etiological level.

n the second decade of life, language skills expand in both quantitative
and qualitative ways. As Nippold (2007) notes in her review of later language development, although many of these changes are more subtle
than the dramatic changes of the first 5 or 6 years, they have equally farranging consequences for the child's cognitive, academic, and social life.
Between the ages of 10 and 15 years, for example, Nippold identifies major changes in the lexicon (e.g., abstract nouns, double-function terms,
prefixes and suffixes); verbal reasoning (e.g., more complex and abstract
analogies); figurative language (e.g., slang, sarcasm, metaphor); syntax
(e.g., more complex subordination, longer clause length); pragmatics (e.g.,
more complex and complete narratives, more coherent persuasive arguments); and literacy (e.g., comprehension of expository texts, distinguishing between fact and opinion).
Many of these changes appear to reflect some broad, general developments that are characteristic of adolescent thought. Nippold (2007)
suggests four such developments that may underlie many of the specific advances in this period. The first major change is a growth in
metacognitive competence--in the case of language, the ability to reflect
upon and analyze language as an object itself. Although growth in this
ability begins much earlier (e.g., phonological awareness in the preschool

years), the skill is stronger and broader in the school
years and permits the analysis and understanding of
new words, grammatical structures, and pragmatic acts
as well as serving as one foundation for understanding
figurative language. A second change, also an aspect of
cognitive development, is the ability to think abstractly.
In language, this is manifested in the acquisition of abstract words and sentence meanings and, together with
metalinguistic skills, makes possible the appreciation of
ambiguity and humor. A third major change concerns social cognition--specifically, a growth in social perspectivetaking. This is the foundation of nearly all the changes in
pragmatics, which concern people's intentions when they
use language and their choices with respect to expressing those intentions. Finally, language development in
the 2nd decade is largely driven by print input rather
than by oral input. Around the fourth grade, the oft-noted
transition between "learning to read" and "reading to
learn" occurs (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998). This transition applies not only to content areas such as history
and science but to language itself, as print introduces
children to advanced vocabulary and syntax and figurative expressions.
The etiology of these new skills in adolescence and
the relationships among them have been little explored--
other than vocabulary, which is often included in studies of verbal intelligence (Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, &
McGuffin, 2008; Plomin & Kovas, 2005). In the present
study, we used twin methodology to examine directly the
diversity and interrelations of language advances in a
large sample of 12-year-old twins (N = 4,892). The age of
12 years is well into the transition to adolescence, which
is characterized by brain and hormonal changes that
very likely play a role in the broad changes listed in the
previous paragraph (Ernst & Mueller, 2008; Spear, 2000).
Although genes themselves do not change with development, changes in the pattern of gene expression play an
important role, and indeed, the relative importance of
genetic variants may change with development and with
learning domain. These shifts have the potential to fundamentally affect the genetic architecture of abilities--
that is, the way in which diverse abilities are related
etiologically (Davis, Haworth, & Plomin, 2009).
In research on earlier stages of language development, multivariate genetic analyses of twin data have
been used to demonstrate a surprising coherence across
diverse abilities. For example, vocabulary and grammar
are generally interpreted as distinct aspects of language
on both linguistic and psychological grounds. However, the
two are highly correlated in early development ( Fenson
et al., 1994). Dionne, Dale, Boivin, and Plomin (2003)
sought the roots of this connection by examining measures of vocabulary and grammar at ages 2 and 3 years in
a large sample of twins. They found evidence for very substantial overlap in the genetic influences on vocabulary

and on grammar--and also for shared (within-family)
environmental influences on the two. They interpreted
these results as strongly suggesting a high degree of overlap in the mechanisms underlying learning and using
these two aspects of language.
Similarly, Hayiou-Thomas et al. (2006) examined
the relationships among a diverse set of measures of articulation, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal
memory at age 42 years for a subset of the twins in the
Dionne et al. (2003) study. Hayiou-Thomas et al. found
that seven of the language measures formed a coherent
latent factor on both phenotypic and genetic grounds,
whereas two other measures constituted an articulation
latent factor. The two factors themselves had substantial etiological overlap.
DeThorne and colleagues (2008) included conversation-based measures such as mean length of utterance
and number of different words along with test-based measures in their study of genetic influences on children's language at age 7 years. Although separate latent factors
could be defined for the conversational and test-based measures, there was significant genetic correlation between
the two.
These findings are consistent with an emerging body
of evidence for the generalist genes hypothesis (Plomin &
Kovas, 2005; Kovas, Haworth, Dale, & Plomin, 2007;
Davis et al., 2009). Most genetic effects are general in
that their effects are found across a range of cognitive
and academic domains. This is most clearly shown in the
magnitude of genetic correlations across measures, which
can be conceptualized as the probability that a gene found
to influence one domain will be found to influence the
other. Genetic correlations among a diverse range of abilities such as reading, language, mathematics, vocabulary,
spatial, and memory abilities are typically between 0.5
and 1.0 (Plomin & Kovas, 2005). However, except for the
two studies described previously (Hayiou-Thomas et al.,
2006; Dionne et al., 2003), this issue has not been addressed within the domain of language. The conclusion of
those two studies--high coherence across diverse language
skills--cannot be assumed to hold in the 2nd decade, given
the substantial qualitative and diverse changes in language development that occur then.
Our broad goal was to examine the etiology of these
new aspects of language at age 12 years. More specifically, we sought (a) to examine the etiology of four measures of language development individually and ( b) to
evaluate the overlap of genetic (and also environmental)
influences on this set of measures. Because multivariate
analyses require large sample sizes in order to have any
precision in parameter estimates, we took advantage of
widespread access to inexpensive and fast broadband
connections in the United Kingdom to administer the measures in Web-based form.

The large and representative sample made it possible to address the question of sex differences as well.
Much less evidence is available concerning sex differences in adolescence than in early childhood or adulthood (the topic is not even mentioned in Nippold, 2007,
nor in many other current reviews). Small but significant
sex differences, typically 1%-2% of the variance, are frequently found on measures of early language development (Fenson et al., 1994; Halpern et al., 2007). However,
the limited findings available to date are more mixed in
adolescence (Hedges & Nowell, 1995). Higher means for
females than males have been found for measures of
language usage, reading comprehension, and especially
writing. Higher means for males are sometimes found for
tests of verbal analogies. Sex differences have also been
found in measures of variability--rather than mean
level--of cognitive and academic abilities, usually reflecting greater variability for boys, although this difference is more strongly supported for mathematics than
for verbal abilities. In addition to asking if there were
differences in mean or variance, we also sought to evaluate the possibility of sex differences in etiology, such as
a difference in the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on language abilities. For example,
Spinath, Price, Dale, and Plomin (2004) found higher
heritability for language ability in boys than in girls at
the preschool stage. However, these are exploratory analyses, and no specific hypotheses were formulated.

Method
Participants
Twins in the present sample were 12-year-old participants in the Twins Early Development Study ( TEDS;
Oliver & Plomin, 2007), a longitudinal study of twins
ascertained from population records of live twin births in
England and Wales (Kovas et al., 2007). Since then, the
sample has remained reasonably representative of the
U.K. population, as determined by comparison with Office of National Statistics census data (Oliver & Plomin,
2007). Informed consent is obtained by mail or online
consent forms, and a test administrator is assigned who
telephones the family and provides assistance and encouragement. We excluded from the present analyses
data from twin pairs with any of the standard set of genetic, medical, and data quality exclusion criteria in
TEDS (see Kovas et al., 2007, for details) or severe current medical problems. Zygosity was determined by a combination of parent questionnaires at 18 months, 3 years,
and 4 years, and by DNA tests for a subsample when the
twins' zygosity was doubtful or when the parents requested it (Kovas et al., 2007). We included only twins
whose first language was English, to eliminate variability due to differences in exposure to English. Finally, we

984

included only twins whose parents reported their ethnicity as "White," which is 93% of this U.K. sample. This
exclusion was selected to maximize genetic similarity in
preparation for later molecular genetic analysis of the
sample. The final sample included 4,892 pairs: 1,758 monozygotic ( MZ) pairs; 1,580 dyzygotic ( DZ) same-sex pairs;
and 1,554 DZ opposite-sex pairs.

Measures
Reliance on Internet-based testing, necessary for
assessment of a large sample, led to our focus on receptive measures. Standardized tests were selected that
had demonstrated ability to discriminate children with
language disability as well as being sensitive to individual differences across the full range of abilities. Within
those constraints, we attempted to select a diverse set of
tests, sampling vocabulary and semantics, syntax, and
pragmatics. An aspect of language that becomes increasingly important in adolescence and that shows substantial variability at this age is metalinguistic ability--that
is, knowledge about language itself (Nippold, 2007). For
this reason, the four measures selected included two measures with low metalinguistic demands (Vocabulary and
Listening Grammar) and two with higher demands (Figurative Language and Making Inferences).
Internet test development and administration. The
language measures reported in this article were part of a
larger Internet-based test battery covering multiple
cognitive and academic domains (Davis et al., 2008). The
battery was developed in collaboration with Planet Three
Publishing (www.planet3.co.uk) and e-Business Systems
(www.e-businesssystems.co.uk). The standardized tests
were modified with a set of adaptive branching rules, so
that all children started with the same items but then
were branched to easier or harder items, depending on
their performance. Adapting to children's competence
increases their engagement while limiting the number
of items that need to be answered ( Birnbaum, 2004).
Points were awarded for correct responses, for unadministered items preceding the child's starting point, and
for items skipped through branching to harder items.
Streaming audio was used where appropriate for tests.
The test battery was self-paced and could be completed
over a period of several weeks. Each child's performance
was monitored online, and families were telephoned at
the start of the testing and provided support and encouragement throughout the process. Games were interspersed with the activities to maintain engagement. For
further information on the testing procedure--including
steps to ensure confidentiality, independence of data from
the twins in each family, and Internet access and connection speed--see Haworth et al. (2007). Cronbach's alpha (a),
a measure of internal consistency for the Web-based test,
is reported for each measure (from Haworth et al., 2007).

Vocabulary. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (3rd ed.; U.K.; WISC-III-UK) Vocabulary Multiple
Choice subtest (Wechsler, 1992) is a multiple-choice test
in which children select from three or four alternative
definitions of a word. Note that the adaptation to multiple choice is part of the development of the U.K. adaptation of the WISC-III (Wechsler, 1992; a = .88).
Nonliteral semantics. In addition to vocabulary,
semantics was assessed through use of Level 2 of the
Figurative Language subtest of the Test of Language
Competence--Expanded Edition (Wiig, Secord, &
Sabers, 1989). This subtest assesses the interpretation
of idioms and metaphors; correct understanding of such
nonliteral language requires rich semantic representation as well as an awareness of the ambiguity of many
expressions between their literal and figurative meaning. The child hears a sentence orally and chooses one of
four answers, presented in both written and oral forms
(a = .66).
Syntax. Syntax was assessed using the Listening
Grammar subtest of the Test of Adolescent and Adult
Language (3rd ed.; TOAL-3; Hammill, Brown, Larsoen,
& Wiederholt, 1994). This test requires the child to select
two sentences that have nearly the same meaning from a
set of three options. The sentences are presented auditorily only (a = .94).
Pragmatics. Level 2 of the Making Inferences subtest of the Test of Language Competence--Expanded
Edition (Wiig et al., 1989) requires participants to make
permissible inferences on the basis of existing, but incomplete, causal relationships presented in short paragraphs that are presented orally. The child chooses two
of four responses, presented in both written and oral form,
that best explain what could have happened (a = .58).

Analysis
Data analysis proceeded through four phases. The
first phase was a phenotypic description of performance
on each of the four measures and their intercorrelations.
The second phase comprised univariate genetic analyses
of each measure, estimating the proportion of variance
due to additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and
nonshared environmental ( E) influences. These proportions are symbolized as a2, c2, and e2, respectively. In this
phase, we also examined the possibility of sex differences in the etiology of each measure. In the third phase,
the etiology of the relationship between each pair of variables was estimated with genetic and environmental correlations. The genetic correlation is an index of the degree
of overlap between the genetic influences on each variable
in the pair--and similarly for the shared environmental
and nonshared environmental correlations. In the fourth
phase, based on the close connection among the measures demonstrated phenotypically and genetically, we

fitted a common pathway model to the data. This model
derives a latent factor for Language using maximum likelihood factor analysis and then partitions the variance in
that factor--variance common to all four measures--into
additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and nonshared environmental (E) components. The same latent
factor model also estimates genetic and environmental
components of the variance specific to each measure. The
genetic analyses of the second, third, and fourth phases
were conducted in the Mx statistical program (Neale,
Boker, Xie, & Maes, 2006). We estimated 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) to indicate the significance of parameter
estimates. For all later analyses, standardized residuals
correcting for age and sex were used because the age of
twins is perfectly correlated across pairs, and sex is perfectly correlated for MZ pairs. Unless corrected, these
factors would inflate the correlation between twins. Note
that the sample sizes are slightly different because the
phenotypic analyses were conducted in SPSS (the statistical software program), which uses listwise deletion,
whereas the genetic analyses were conducted in Mx,
which estimates parameters using full information maximum likelihood techniques for missing data.

Results
Phenotypic Analyses
Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations
for each measure, subdivided by sex and zygosity. A small
sex difference was observed for Listening Grammar and
Making Inferences, but it accounted for only 0.2% of
the variance in both cases. There were no significant sex
differences in variance in performance. Overall, MZ and
DZ twins performed at similar levels, although there
was a trend for DZ pairs to score slightly higher, on average; this difference was significant for Vocabulary and
Listening Grammar but again accounted for much less
than 1% of the variance. Table 2 presents the correlations
among the four measures, which are all at least moderate
in magnitude. The Vocabulary and Listening Grammar
scores showed bimodality; consequently, these and later
analyses were also conducted with those scores recoded
in quintiles to produce a more uniform distribution. The
results were virtually indistinguishable and are not
reported here (details are available upon request from
the authors).

Univariate Genetic Analyses
Intraclass correlations are presented in Table 3 for
the MZ and DZ twins at each age. The correlations are
consistently higher for MZ than DZ twins, with a lack
of overlap between the CIs, suggesting a significant genetic contribution to each measure. An estimate of the

Note. MZ = monozygotic twins; DZ = dizygotic twins; F, p, and m2 were derived from multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) performed
using 1 member of each twin pair (N = 4,319; 925 MZ girls; 1,476 DZ girls; 659 MZ boys; 1,259 DZ boys). MANOVA data are as follows: Intercept,
F (4, 4312) = 1.39, p = .24; Sex, F (4, 4312) = 5.86, p < .00; zygosity, F (4, 4312) = 1.75, p = .137; Sex x Zygosity, F (4, 4312) = 0.362, p < .01.

genetic influence can be obtained by doubling the MZ-DZ
correlation difference; this yields heritability estimates
of 32%, 34%, 24%, and 34% for the four measures ( Vocabulary, Listening Grammar, Making Inferences, and Figurative Language, respectively). More accurate estimates
of heritability and the other etiological parameters--
shared environmental influence and nonshared environmental influence--are provided by standard univariate
model-fitting, using the Mx statistical program (Neal et al.,
2006). Parameter estimates derived from this modelfitting are also included in Table 3, as well as 95% CIs.
The overlapping CIs seen in each of the last three columns of the table suggest that the four measures do not
differ significantly in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences.
Although Table 1 showed only very small, albeit
significant, sex differences on two of the measures and
none on the other two with respect to mean levels of performance, it is possible that there are etiological differences between the sexes on one or more of the measures.
To evaluate this possibility, we computed a set of univariate sex-limitation models. The basic approach is to
constrain various parameters (such as A, C, and E) to be
the same for the two sexes for each measure and to determine if the fit of the model is significantly worsened. As

the results of this analysis in the Appendix show, in no
case was the fit worsened significantly, even when all
parameters were constrained to be equal. This result
demonstrates that there are no quantitative differences
in etiology for the sexes--that is, differences in the balance of genetic or environmental factors. It also implies
that there are no qualitative sex differences--that is,
evidence that different genetic factors or different environmental factors influence scores for the two sexes.
Consequently, all further analyses combined the data
from both sexes.

Bivariate (Pairwise) Analyses
We next performed six bivariate genetic analyses,
one for each pair of variables. Each of these analyses
estimates three etiological correlations, all included in
Table 4. The genetic correlations are reported above the
diagonal. This statistic is a measure of the degree of
overlap of genetic influences on both variables--that is,
the extent to which it is the same genes that influence
the pair. ( It should be noted that genetic correlations are
independent of the heritability--the actual influence of
genes on each measure--so that genetic correlations can
be high even when heritabilities are modest.) The figures that appear below the diagonal in Table 4 are the
shared environmental and nonshared environmental
correlations, defined analogously. The genetic correlations (rA) are all high, exceeding .71 and with a median
value of .87. The shared environmental correlations (rC)
are almost equally high, exceeding .61, with a median value of .78. The nonshared environmental correlations (rE)
are much lower, with a range of .08 to .13. Thus, it appears
that the same genetic and shared environmental factors
appear to influence all four measures but that nonshared
environmental factors differ among the measures.

measures suggest that an analysis of shared variance
among the measures would be appropriate. In the common pathways model, a latent factor for language is
estimated that eliminates measure-specific variance, including errors of measurement, to the extent that errors
are not correlated across all measures. Measure-specific
reliable variance is also eliminated at this step. The shared
variance in that latent factor is then partitioned into additive genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental components. The model also estimates the
influences on the remaining measure-specific variances.
The results of this model-fitting are displayed in
Figure 1. All four measures load strongly on the latent
factor. The heritability of the latent language factor
(a2 = .59) is higher than for the individual factors (in
Table 3), accounting for more than half of the variance,
and shared environmental influence (c2 = .28) is also increased. Nonshared environmental influence is modest
(e2 = .13).
Figure 1 also includes the etiology of measure-specific
influence. Only for the Listening Grammar measure is
there significant evidence for measure-specific genetic
influence (a2 = .32), and only for the Making Inferences
measure is there significant evidence for measure-specific
shared environmental influence (c2 = .26). The majority
of the measure-specific variance for each of the measures
is nonshared environmental, which includes both twinspecific experience and error variance.

divides the total additive genetic influence for each measure into two components: (a) general genetic influence
shared in common with the other measures and ( b) specific genetic influence that is unique to the measure. For
example, the genetic influence on Figurative Language
(.36, in Table 3) is the sum of genetic influence shared
with other measures (.59 x .712 = .29) plus the measurespecific genetic influence (.262 = .07). The shared environmental influence and nonshared environmental
influence can also be divided in this way. In Table 5, the
variance for each of the four measures is thus divided
among six sources: A, C, and E influences on the latent
factor, which indirectly influence the measure, and A, C,
and E influences, which are measure specific. ( The figures in Table 5 do not sum exactly to the univariate parameters listed in Table 3 due to the use of multivariate
model-fitting, which is more accurate, but the differences
are very small.)

Discussion
The four aspects of language tested at age 12 years
are qualitatively different from measures of language
development in the preschool years, and the set incorporates considerable diversity in itself. Furthermore,
they appear to have strong and complex relationships
with other aspects of development, including cognitive,
social, and academic aspects. Our first goal was to examine the etiology of the measures individually. All four
were moderately heritable (.25-.36), comparable to the
results for the individual measures assessed at 42 years
(Kovas et al., 2005), although the influence of shared environment was lower at the older age. A second goal was
to examine the relationship among the measures. The
four were moderately related phenotypically, as shown
by the similar factor loadings for the four measures in
Figure 1 as well as for the correlations in Table 2. They
are even more strongly related etiologically; as the correlations in Table 4 illustrate, it is largely the same genes
and the same shared environmental factors that influence all four measures. Again, this outcome is analogous
to the pattern observed at 42 years (Hayiou-Thomas

et al., 2006). But it is even more notable at age 12 years
because of increased diversity among the measures. In
particular, there is no evidence for dissociation between
measures with low metalinguistic requirements (Vocabulary and Listening Grammar) and those with high requirements ( Making Inferences and Figurative Language).

The finding of a high degree of overlap in the genetic
factors that influence these measures as well as overlap
among the shared environmental factors that play a role
suggests common mechanisms for learning aspects of
language as diverse as vocabulary, grammar, inference,
and figurative language. Much research has confirmed

that even for the learning of vocabulary, a rich repertoire
of social, statistical, and cognitive skills are required--a
repertoire that would be equally useful for other aspects
of language (Bavin, 2009; Golinkoff et al., 2000). In this
view, genetic and environmental influences are seen as
affecting development in all domains simultaneously;
however, other interpretations of these empirical findings
on etiology are possible. Language development may be
strongly cumulative in nature; if so, anything that influences an earlier stage will necessarily affect later
stages. Vocabulary forms an important early foundation
such that effective mastery of vocabulary may be essential (although not necessarily sufficient) for grammar
learning (Marchman & Thal, 2005). Similarly, achieving
a certain level of competence in vocabulary and grammar may be essential before inference and figurative comprehension are possible. This situation may be analogous
to a well-established example from the literacy domain:
the relationship of word recognition, especially fluency of
recognition, to reading comprehension. Because comprehension is so strongly dependent on fluency of word
recognition, factors that are related to the former will be
related to the latter (Catts, Hogan, & Adlof, 2005; Olson
& Byrne, 2005). Several aspects of Figure 1, particularly
the measure-specific effects, are consistent with this cumulative model. There is neither genetic nor shared environmental measure-specific influence on Vocabulary.
For Listening Grammar, there is a measure-specific genetic influence beyond that of the latent factor, and for
Making Inferences, there is a measure-specific shared
environmental influence. These two measures are, on a
priori analysis, the most distinct from Vocabulary learning. Deciding between these and other models will require other kinds of evidence, including longitudinal and
intervention research.
The close relationship among the measures led to
the development of a common pathways model, which
examined the etiology of the shared variance among the
measures. This analysis led to the major difference between the present results and those of Hayiou-Thomas
et al. (2006) for 42 year olds. In the present study, the
heritability estimated for the latent factor, .59, is substantially higher than the .34 estimated for the language
factor at the earlier age. Increasing heritability of traits
with development is a frequent finding (Haworth et al.,
2009). As Haworth et al. (2009) noted, longitudinal genetic
research (e.g., Kovas et al., 2007) most often finds evidence that genes--rather than change--contribute to continuity. That finding runs counter to a prediction based on
more genes becoming functional in the brain during the
transition to adolescence. A more plausible mechanism
that might underlie this increase in heritability for language is genotype-environment correlation (Plomin et al.,
2008). If children influence, or select, their environments
on the basis of their genetic predispositions--whether,

for example, they prefer talking, book reading, and dramatic play to puzzles, blocks, and construction play--
and if the practice that occurs in those environments
facilitates further development, genetically driven variation among children will increase with development. In
fact, Oliver, Dale, and Plomin (2005) found a modest but
significant heritable component to the amount of early
literacy experience, such as book reading, which children experienced at age 4 years.
Our third goal was to evaluate the possibility of sex
differences in language skills at age 12 years, including potential differences in mean level, variability, and
etiology. Only for two of the measures was there a significant sex difference with respect to mean level, in both
cases favoring girls, but they were of very small magnitude ( less than 1%). No differences were found for
variability or etiology. These results again are similar to
those for 42 year olds. Using the same dataset as HayiouThomas et al. (2006), Kovas et al. (2005) found small but
significant sex differences favoring girls for five of the
seven language measures, ranging from 0.2% to 0.7% of
the variance. Thus, despite some small sex differences in
mean performance, there is no evidence at either 42 or at
12 years for differences in the underlying etiology for boys
and girls.

Limitations and Conclusions
The conclusions of this study must be qualified by
several limitations in the design. First, reliance on
Internet-based testing required limiting our assessment
to receptive language measures. Whether expressive language measures fit into the same pattern can only be
decided on the basis of further research. More generally,
inclusion of a wider battery of measures--such as speech
(Hayiou-Thomas et al., 2006), derivational morphology,
verbal analogies, irony, or literate lexicon--might produce different results. The second limitation is evidence
for limited reliability--and, hence, validity--of some of
the individual measures. Correlations between MZ twins
are often used as `lower-bound' estimates of reliability,
and they are only moderate here (.43-.53). Consistent
with these figures, the internal consistency of Figurative
Language (.66) and Making Inferences (.58) was quite
modest. (The figures for this Web-administered, adaptive
testing format were only slightly below the internal consistency figures for the test as originally developed, however: .71 and .66, respectively.) Moreover, Haworth et al.
(2007) did not directly test the concurrent validity of these
Web-based measures for language. However, the effect
of limited reliability is to decrease estimates of heritability and shared environmental influence for those measures; therefore, the figures in Table 3 may be taken as
conservative. Limited reliability was a major motivation
for use of a latent factor analysis, which abstracts away

from error variance, assigning it to measure-specific nonshared environment. The latent factor that remains is
inherently more reliable.
Despite these qualifications, however, the present
results do support a characterization of language skills
at age 12 years as substantially integrated, consistent
with the generalist genes hypothesis. In this article, we
have provided evidence for general effects within the
domain of language. Similar findings emerge from the
analyses of Davis et al. (2009), who examined a wider
range of measures of cognitive and academic abilities.
Following Haworth et al. (2009), we suggest that
finding substantially greater heritability for language at
age 12 years than for language at earlier years has an
intriguing implication: It should be easier to identify
genes with effects on language development by studying
adolescents, or even adults, than by studying young children. It will be possible to evaluate the accuracy of this
prediction as genome-wide association studies of language development are conducted in the near future.

Note. For all measures, six models were fit. Model 1: Full model, in which rA within DZO twins was allowed to fall below .5 and A, C, and E parameters
were allowed to differ by sex (i.e., allowing for both qualitative genetic differences and quantitative sex differences). Model 2: rA within DZO twins was set
to .5; A, C, and E parameters were allowed to differ by sex. Model 3: rA within DZO twins was set to .5; A parameters were equated for boys and girls,
but C and E parameters were allowed to differ by zygosity. Model 4: This model is similar to Model 3, but C parameters were equated for boys and girls. Model 5:
This model is similar to Model 3, but E parameters were equated for boys and girls. Model 6: rA within DZO twins was set to .5; A, C and E parameters
were equated for boys and girls (i.e., no qualitative or quantitative sex differences). No significant differences were obtained among the models for each
measure. LL = log likelihood; AIC = Akaike information criterion; BIC = Bayesian information criterion; DIC = deviance information criterion; DZO = dyzygotic
opposite-sex pairs; ACE = additive genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental factors.
