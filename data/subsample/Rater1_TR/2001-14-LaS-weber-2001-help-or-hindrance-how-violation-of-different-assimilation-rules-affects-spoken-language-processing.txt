ABSTRACT

Four phoneme-detection studies tested the conclusion from recent research
that spoken-language processing is inhibited by violation of obligatory assimifacilitation
lation processes in the listeners' native language. In Experiment 1, native
listeners of German detected a target fricative in monosyllabic Dutch nonwords,
inhibition
half of which violated progressive German fricative place assimilation. In
contrast to the earlier findings, listeners detected the fricative more quickly
novel popout
when assimilation was violated than when no violation occurred. This
difference was not due to purely acoustic factors, since in Experiment 2 native
Dutch listeners, presented with the same materials, showed no such effect. In Experiment 3, German
listeners again detected the fricative more quickly when violation occurred in both monosyllabic and
bisyllabic native nonwords, further ruling out explanations based on non-native input or on syllable
structure. Finally Experiment 4 tested whether the direction in which the rule operates (progressive or
regressive) controls the direction of the effect on phoneme detection responses. When regressive German
place assimilation for nasals was violated, German listeners detected stops more slowly, exactly as had
been observed in previous studies of regressive assimilation. It is argued that a combination of low
expectations in progressive assimilation and novel popout causes facilitation of processing, whereas
not fulfilling high expectations in regressive assimilation causes inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

The language input listeners have to process is far from consistent, not least because incoming
continuous speech is subject to many phonological adjustment processes. Variation in length
of phonemes, vowel reduction, elision of vowels, consonant and vowel epenthesis, reduction
of consonant clusters, varying position of word stress and assimilation all occur constantly
in spoken language. Despite all the variability, native listeners have little trouble in under* Acknowledgments: I thank Anne Cutler, James McQueen, and Natasha Warner for their insightful

Processing violation of assimilation

standing spoken language. They can accommodate to and even profit from rule -bound
variation.
The present study focuses on the role in spoken-language processing of one type of
phonological rule, namely assimilation. Assimilation is the process by which an inherent
feature in a sound segment is altered under the coarticulatory influence of neighboring
segments. The direction of assimilation can be regressive (i.e., a later segment affects an
earlier one) or progressive (i.e., an earlier segment affects a later one) and is always an
adjustment of the sound segment to its context. Rules of assimilation can be either optional
or obligatory. If a rule is optional, both realizations, the adjusted and the unadjusted, are
legal. If a rule is obligatory, there is only one legal standard realization. The English phrase
ten bikes offers a site for optional regressive assimilation: the nasal can be realized in
colloquial speech with a bilabial segment as [tEm baIks] and in more careful speech with
an alveolar nasal as [tEn baIks] . The place feature of the bilabial stop can be spread to the
preceding nasal. An example of optional progressive assimilation is found in the two possible
realizations of the German word leben `live' either as [le:bm ] or as [le:bn ] in more careful
speech. In this case the place feature of the bilabial stop can be spread to the following
nasal. In contrast, regressive place assimilation for nasals is obligatory in Japanese. The
Japanese morpheme san `three' occurs in many compound words: sangatsu `March,'sanban
`third,' sanju `thirty'. In the first of these the final nasal of the first syllable is realized as
velar [I] , in the second as bilabial [m] , in the third as dental-alveolar [n] . Place of articulation of the nasal differs as a function of the place of articulation of the following segment.
Recently a number of studies have investigated assimilation in Dutch, English, and
Japanese, via phoneme-detection or word- recognition tasks (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson,
1996; Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1998; Koster, 1987; Kuijpers & Van Donselaar, in
preparation; Otake, Yoneyama, Cutler, & Van der Lugt, 1996; Quene, Van Rossum, & Van
Wijck, 1998). Those studies have shown a highly consistent pattern of results even though
they were testing different languages and different assimilation rules and were using different
experimental tasks. The results showed that spoken-language processing is neither
facilitated nor interfered with by optional assimilation, but is inhibited by violation of
obligatory assimilation.
For English, Koster (1987) investigated optional regressive place assimilation.
Regressive place assimilation in English occurs optionally between morphemes in connected
speech. The alveolar stop /t/ in sweet girl is either maintained or takes over the velar feature
of the subsequent stop. The listeners' task was to press a button as soon as they heard the
velar stop /g/ in [gAEl] (girl).1 Koster did not find any evidence for exploitation of place
cues in assimilated words: listeners were equally fast in detecting /g/ in [gAEl ] after [ swit]
or [ swik] . Thus, if assimilation is optional, speed of detection is unaffected by whether or
not an immediately preceding consonant is assimilated to the target segment.
Gaskell and Marslen-Wilson (1996) investigated effects of place assimilation in
English on the recognition of spoken words. They used a cross -modal repetition priming
paradigm for their first experiments. English subjects listened to sentences that were

truncated after a prime word, the last sound of which was either assimilated to the following
removed word or not. If, for example, the prime word wicked was originally followed by
the word prank, wicked was realized in one case as [wIkIb] and in a second as [wIkId] .
The word prank was cut off after recording. After hearing the truncated sentence, subjects
had to make a lexical decision on the now visually presented target word wicked. Reactions
to the visual targets were equally fast after assimilated or unassimilated auditory prime
words. In a second experiment, listeners heard the complete sentence where the assimilated
form [wIkIb] was either followed by prank where the feature change in [wIkIb] is phonologically viable or by game where the feature change is not viable. Word recognition was
affected if the assimilated form was followed by the phonologically nonviable context: the
lexical decision on the target word wicked was delayed. Recognition of spoken words was
not affected by optional assimilation but was impaired by inappropriately applied
assimilation.
In a follow -up experiment Gaskell and Marslen-Wilson found similar effects with
the phoneme - monitoring task (Gaskell & Marslen -Wilson, 1998). They investigated
whether processing of the second segment interacted with the presence of the immediately
preceding segment. Phoneme detection of the second segment was considerably slower
when it occurred in a nonviable context (e.g., /k/ in fun camp realized as *[fom k{mp] )
than when it occurred in an unchanged context (e.g., /k/ in [fon k{mp] ), but there was no
advantage for /k/ following viably assimilated segments ( [foI k{mp] ) over unchanged
segments. Thus, inappropriate application of assimilation rules signif icantly slowed
processing while lawful assimilation failed to facilitate it.
A similar result obtains for Dutch. Dutch allows optional voicing assimilation across
obstruent sequences. Thus in Dutch the word kaas `cheese' before boer `monger' may be
realized with a voiced fricative as [kaz.bu:r] instead of [kas.bu:r] . In a phoneme- monitoring
task it was shown that voice assimilation did not facilitate recognition of the subsequent
consonant /b/ (Kuijpers & Van Donselaar, in preparation). Dutch listeners detected the
target segment equally fast in Dutch words whether the preceding segment was lawfully
assimilated or unassimilated in an optional assimilation case. On the other hand, when the
target is preceded by misapplication of assimilation, detection was significantly slowed.
Dutch listeners found it harder to detect the target /p/ in kaasplank `cheese board' if the
fricative was voiced *[kaz.plAIk] , than /p/ in [kas.plAIk] with an unvoiced fricative. The
first form is not an assimilation environment, so that voicing in that position is inappropriate and consequently interfered with processing.
In Japanese, assimilation of place for a nasal and a following stop consonant is
obligatory. The nasal must be homorganic with the following consonant in words like tombo
`dragonfly' where the moraic nasal is realized as bilabial [m] before the bilabial stop /b/
and in kondo `this time' where the moraic nasal is alveolar before the stop consonant /d/ .
In the study of Otake et al. (1996) Japanese listeners responded equally rapidly and
accurately to moraic nasals irrespective of their place of articulation. When asked to respond
to the following stop, however, the same listeners were sensitive to the violation of the
obligatory place assimilation. Their reaction times (RTs) in a phoneme monitoring task
using real Japanese words were significantly slower in rule-violating items (heterorganic
nasal and following stop consonant) than in lawfully assimilated items (homorganic nasal
and following stop consonant).

Processing violation of assimilation

Phonological adjustment processes, however, differ between languages. Listeners may
use the phonological knowledge of their native language when listening to a non-native
language. For instance the place assimilation rule for nasals tested by Otake et al. (1996)
in Japanese is optional in certain environments in Dutch. In order to find out how the
knowledge of one's native language affects the perception of spoken non-native languages,
Otake et al. presented Dutch listeners with the same Japanese materials (which, for the
Dutch listeners, were nonwords). These listeners, for whom assimilation of nasal-stop
sequences is optional, showed no difference in their detection times for stop consonant
targets preceded by nasals matched versus unmatched in place of articulation. For Dutch
listeners no violation of their native phonology was involved.
Processing of a non-native language might, however, be influenced by violations of
native language phonotactic constraints (even though the sequences are permissible in the
language in which they were produced). Obligatory phonological rules of the native
language of a listener may be violated when listening to a non- native language because
these phonological rules do not apply in the non- native language. Although it can be argued
that violation of assimilation rules is not usually encountered in native spoken language,
it can occur in a non- native language. This situation is encountered by people learning a
foreign language, or hearing someone speak their own language with a foreign accent.
Listening to a non-native language which incorporates rules not valid for the native language
appears to be no problem (see Otake et al., 1996), but what if the non- native language
violates rules which do hold in the native language? Experiment 1 of the present study
sought to examine whether phoneme detection during processing of a non-native language
is sensitive to the violation of a native assimilation rule.
At the same time two other factors were changed relative to previous studies. The
previous studies tested assimilation at least across a syllable boundary (see Otake et
al., 1996), some even across a word boundary (see Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1996;
Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1998; Koster, 1987; Kuijpers & Van Donselaar, in preparation).
The reason for this may be that most studies have tested optional assimilation processes,
and optional assimilation does not occur (in the languages tested) within a syllable. However,
recent research in speech perception suggests that sublexical units such as the syllable can
be crucial in speech segmentation and recognition (see Cutler, 1995 for a review). Therefore
syllable structure may have had a crucial influence on previous findings. Thus far, how
assimilation violation is processed in monosyllables has not been tested. Experiment 1
therefore uses monosyllables. A direct comparison between the processing of assimilation
violation in monosyllables and bisyllables follows in Experiment 3.
Another constant factor thus far was the direction in which the assimilation rule
operates. Previous experiments have only tested regressive assimilation. In regressive assimilation, a segment has an effect on the preceding segment, whereas in progressive assimilation
a segment has an effect on the following segment. Both regressive and progressive assimilations form phonotactically legal segment strings, and violations of both types of assimilation
result in phonotactically illegal sequences. But regressive and progressive assimilation
contexts differ in the kind of expectations that they can induce in listeners.
In any phonological sequence, the set of possible later segments is always restricted, to
greater or lesser extent, by the sequential phonotactics of the language. For any two-segment
string, for example, listeners can therefore develop expectations about what the second

segment will be on the basis of the information they hear in the first segment. A regressive
assimilation rule imposes strong constraints on these expectations, by limiting the set of
possible continuations in a specific way. Under Japanese regressive place assimilation, for
example, if the segment following a bilabial nasal consonant is a stop, it must also be bilabial.
A violation of regressive assimilation thus results in a violation of these expectations; a
segment that was not a member of the small set of expected continuations is heard. Progressive
assimilation, on the other hand, does not act to impose particular limits on the set of possible
continuations; instead, it acts to specifically exclude certain continuations. Under German
progressive fricative assimilation, for example, the velar fricative is explicitly ruled out after
front vowels (see below). Violation of progressive assimilation therefore results in a different
kind of violation of the expectations set up by the first sound in a two-segment sequence; a
segment that is a member of a small set of impossible continuations is heard.
As already noted, inhibition effects have been shown in previous experiments when
listeners' expectations about an upcoming segment were defeated in regressive-assimilation violations. Given that progressive assimilation constrains the set of possible
continuations in a different way to regressive assimilation, one can ask whether the defeat
of the expectations caused by progressive assimilation will also result in an inhibition effect.
The present experiments addressed this issue. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 tested a progressive
assimilation rule. Experiment 4 tested a regressive assimilation rule.
In the first experiment of the present study, listeners were presented with non- native
language input, in which a progressive native assimilation rule was violated within syllables.
Two closely related languages were used: Dutch and German. The distribution of the palatal
fricative [C] and the velar fricative [x] in standard German provided the phonological
background. Many phonologists, including Trubetzkoy (1939) and Wurzel (1980) have
discussed these two allophonic variants, the distribution of which is predictable. The two
fricatives stand in complementary distribution in German: the velar fricative [x] occurs
after back vowels, the palatal fricative [C] after front vowels, glides, sonorant consonants,
word -initially and in the diminutive suffix -chen (see Hall, 1989, among many others).
Thus the place of articulation of a vowel specifies the place of articulation for the following
fricative (progressive assimilation). 2 Whereas German lacht `laughs' is realized as [laxt]
with a velar fricative due to the preceding back vowel, German Licht `light' is realized as
[lICt] with a palatal fricative due to the preceding front vowel. It would violate German
fricative assimilation to realize the German word Licht as *[lIxt] with a velar fricative and
would result in the illegal sequence *[Ix] .
This distribution does not apply for standard Dutch, since the Dutch phoneme
repertoire contains only the velar form of the fricative (Booij, 1995).3 Dutch lacht `laughs'
2

The suffix -chen is an exception, as preceding vowel quality does not affect the fricative in this
case, but the fricative is conditioned by a morpheme boundary. This leads to a few apparent minimal
pairs, such as [ ku:x@n] (Kuchen `cake') and [ku:C@n] (Kuhchen `small cow').

Gussenhoven (1992) has pointed out that in some varieties of Dutch a postvelar or uvular fricative
[X] rather than the velar form occurs. For German, Kohler(1990) found variation between [x]
and [X] after some back vowels. However, the velar fricative [x] is possible in both standard German
and Dutch.

Processing violation of assimilation

and Dutch licht `light' are both realized with a velar fricative in postvocalic word position
as [lAxt] and [lIxt], regardless of the place of articulation of the preceding vowel. These
different distributions make it possible to use German and Dutch to ask whether the native
phonological structure influences processing of a non-native language. When German
listeners attend to Dutch, they hear repeated violations of German fricative assimilation.
Do German listeners show an inhibition effect (as observed in the other assimilation studies)
when they are listening to Dutch items which violate obligatory German progressive fricative
assimilation within syllables?
The generalized phoneme monitoring procedure (Segui & Frauenfelder, 1986), in
which a predetermined target segment can occur anywhere in the stimulus, was chosen as
the experimental task. Phoneme monitoring involves two tasks for the subjects, listening
to speech and detecting a predetermined target segment (for an overview see Connine &
Titone, 1997). The measured response times are assumed to reflect variations in speech
processing, where longer RTs are associated with greater processing load.
Two types of phonotactically legal Dutch monosyllables were examined. All were
nonwords both in German and in Dutch to avoid any potential lexical effects from cognates
across the closely related languages. One type of monosyllable contained a front vowel
followed by the velar fricative [x] in penultimate position (e.g., [bExt] ). The other type
contained a back vowel followed by the velar fricative [x] in penultimate position (e.g.,
[bAxt] ). The nonwords with back vowels were possible sequences in both standard Dutch
and German. The nonwords with front vowels violated a German phonotactic constraint,
but were legal in Dutch. In the first experiment German listeners were presented with the
Dutch speech stimuli. Their task was to detect the target fricative [x] in the Dutch nonwords.
An inhibition effect for violation of the German phonotactic constraint would show that
listeners make use of their native phonological structure for phoneme recognition while
listening to a non-native language.
EXPERIMENT 1

Method
Subjects

Twenty- four students of the University of Regensburg in Germany were paid to take part
in the experiment. They were all native speakers of German and had no knowledge of Dutch.
Materials

A list of 28 monosyllabic items, nonwords in Dutch and German, was selected with the
help of the CELEX database (Baayen, Piepenbrock, & Van Rijn, 1993). All items ended with
the velar fricative [x] followed by the stop /t/ , having the syllable structure CVxt or CCVxt
(such as [hOxt] and [frIxt]). This syllable structure is common in both Dutch and German.
No phonotactic constraints of either language, except the fricative assimilation in question,
were violated in these nonwords. Only phonemes which occur in both languages were used,
with one exception: the Dutch nonword `wocht' [VOxt] is realized with a labiodental
approximant, while in German it would be realized with a labiodental fricative (Booij, 1995;
Wiese, 1996). The labiodental approximant does not occur in German. This small difference

was reckoned unlikely to have significant influence on processing. Fourteen of the chosen
nonwords contained the front vowels /E/ or /I/ , while 14 other nonwords contained the
back vowels /a/ or /O/ . Only short vowels were used because short vowels predominate in
closed syllables in German. Since all items had to be nonwords in both languages which
violated no phonotactic constraints other than fricative assimilation, it was not possible to
find 14 matched pairs of nonwords that differed only in the vowel. This was taken into account
in the statistical analyses. The nonwords are listed in Appendix 1.
In addition, 308 mono - and bi -syllabic filler nonwords, also legal nonwords in both
Dutch and German, were selected. Eighty-four of the fillers contained the fricative [x] in
a variety of positions in the nonwords. All fillers contained one of the four vowels /E/ , /I/ ,
/a/ or /O/ . From the complete set of 336 items, four different pseudorandom orders were
constructed, with the restriction that for at least two items before a target item, only fillers
without the target fricative [x] were used. Fourteen similar practice items were created and
presented at the beginning of the experiment. Three pauses were put in the experiment,
one after the practice list and two more in the experiment itself, after every 112 items.
Procedure

All materials were recorded onto a DAT tape in a sound -proof booth by a female native
speaker of Dutch, who also speaks German. The experimental stimulus nonwords were
recorded two or three times and the best pronunciation was selected for use in the
experiment. Although only phonemes that occur in both languages were used, there are of
course phonetic differences especially in vowel quality between the two languages. Two
native Dutch speakers listened to the materials and confirmed that they sounded Dutch.
Speech stimuli were down-sampled during transfer to a computer to 16 kHz.
Each item was labeled using the Xwaves speech editor. Additionally, point labels were
put in the experimental items at the beginning of the fricative [x] . Each nonword was then
transferred as an individual speech file to the hard -disc of a personal computer. Stimulus
presentation, timing, and data collection were performed using NESU experiment control
software.
German subjects were tested one at a time in a sound- proof booth. They were told
that they were to listen for the target fricative [x] in a series of Dutch nonwords, and they
were instructed to press the button in front of them with their preferred hand as fast as
possible if they detected [x] in any of the nonwords. Written instructions were given, telling
the subjects to respond to the sound represented in orthography as ch as in the word Nacht
`night'. In German orthography both the velar and the palatal fricative are realized as ch.
To make the task clear, additional oral instructions were given using German example words
with the velar fricative only. Response times were measured from the onset of each target
nonword. Each subject heard the practice list first, followed, after a short pause, by all
experimental stimuli in one of the four pseudorandomized orders. The experiment lasted
approximately 18 minutes.
Results and Discussion

Prior to statistical analysis, RTs, which were originally measured from the onset of the
items, were adjusted so as to measure from the onset of the target fricative [x] . Missed

responses were treated as errors. All RTs lay within the range of 100 to 1500ms. Mean
RTs and mean error rates are given in Table 1.
Instead of responding more slowly, German subjects detected the fricative [x] 28 ms
more quickly when the progressive German fricative assimilation rule was violated than
when no violation occurred. Computed RTs were submitted to Analyses of Variance
(ANOVAs), with both subjects (F1 ) and items (F2 ) as the repeated measure. The pattern in
the RTs was significant by subjects, F1 (1, 23)= 4.82, p < .04. By items, however, the effect
did not reach significance, F2 (1, 26)= 3.01, p > .09.
The reason why the items analysis failed to be significant was found in one of the
illegal items. RTs to this particular item were on average 93 ms slower than RTs to the
other 13 items in that context. Also this particular item showed the highest standard
deviation. There was however a particularly slow item like this in the legal context as well.
RTs to this item were on average 145 ms slower than RTs to the other 13 items in that context.
Again, this particular item showed the highest standard deviation for its context. When both
items were excluded, the mean RTs were 463 ms to illegal items and 488 ms to legal items.
An analysis resulted in a significant effect of context for subjects and items, F1 (1, 23) =
6.69, p < .02; F2 (1, 24)= 5.74, p < .03. The low percentage of errors indicates that subjects
had no problems detecting the target in the two types of nonwords. An error analysis revealed
no significant main effect.
Whereas in all earlier studies violation of assimilation resulted in slower RTs (Gaskell
& Marslen-Wilson, 1996; Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1998; Koster, 1987; Kuijpers & Van
Donselaar, in preparation; Otake et al., 1996), RTs in Experiment 1 were faster to items
containing such violations.
Why did this facilitation effect occur? The first and most obvious explanation was
that some acoustic factors caused facilitation of processing rather than inhibition. Therefore
an analysis of the duration of the target sound was performed. It is possible that RTs might
be influenced by differences in the length of the presented target fricative, as length provides
a simple measure of acoustic difference between targets across contexts. For the remaining
26 items (after excluding the two items with particularly slow RTs) the fricative [x] was
on average 14 ms shorter after front vowels, with an average length of 177 ms, than after
back vowels, with the average length of 191 ms, t (12)= 1.86, p > .07. A correlation analysis
with the RT data showed that there was no tendency for length to be correlated with RTs
after both back and front vowels (after back vowels: r(13)= .30, p > .3; after front vowels:
r (13) = .23, p > .4).
Since in Dutch the fricative does not assimilate to the preceding vowel, the vowel

might assimilate to the fricative instead. The velar fricative could have caused the preceding
front vowel to have been produced lower and/or further back than elsewhere. This would
be apparent in the first and the second formant of the front vowel. A comparison of F1 and
F2 in target items such as [pIxt] and [pExt] and fillers with the same vowels but no velar
fricative such as [bIft] and [blEmp] showed no difference between the vowels before [x]
and elsewhere. The formants were measured in the last third of the vowel and an inspection
of the means of F1 and F2 for both front vowels in target items and fillers suggested that
there was no lowering or backing in the target items compared to the fillers. Thus vowel
quality could not have been a cue for the upcoming fricative.
Another way to test whether the results of Experiment 1 were due to acoustic
confounds is to present the materials to subjects for whom they violate no rules: Dutch
listeners. If the results of Experiment 1 are due to violation of phonological constraints,
they should not replicate for subjects who lack the constraint. If, however, Dutch listeners
showed a difference in their RTs, there might be unintended acoustic differences between
the two sets of nonwords. Items had been chosen for Experiment 1 which were nonwords
in both languages, German and Dutch. Once again the use of nonwords excluded lexical
effects for both Dutch and for German listeners.
EXPERIMENT 2

Method
Subjects

Twenty- four native speakers of Dutch, students at the University of Nijmegen in the
Netherlands, took part in the experiment. They were paid for their participation.
Materials

The same Dutch materials and the same lists as described in Experiment 1 were used.
Procedure

The same procedure as in Experiment 1 was used. The only difference was that for the
Dutch subjects all the materials were legal Dutch nonwords that contained no phonological violation. The subjects were tested one, two, or three at a time in separate
sound- proof booths. They were told that they would listen to Dutch nonwords. Instructions
were given again in writing and orally using Dutch example words such as nacht `night'
and geld `money' (the velar fricative can be realized in Dutch orthography both as ch and
as g).
Results and Discussion

Mean RTs (from onset of the target fricative) and mean error rates are given in Table 2.
Missed responses and one RT being slower than 1500 ms were treated as errors.
For the Dutch subjects, listening to their native language, no phonological violation
occurred in the materials. Accordingly, they showed no difference in their RTs between

Since the RTs of German listeners in Experiment 1 were faster than those of Dutch
listeners in Experiment 2, a post hoc analysis was performed to check for the presence of
interaction effects of language and context. A two factor mixed ANOVA was used, with
language of the listener as the between subjects factor and context, with the two levels
front and back vowel, as the repeated measures factor. Neither the main effect of language
nor that of context reached significance by both subjects and items. The interaction of
language and context did not quite reach significance either by subjects, F1 (1, 46)= 3.71,
p = .06, or by items, F2 (1, 26)= 3.30, p = .08. A t-test showed that German listeners' reactions
to the velar fricative [x] after a front vowel were significantly faster than Dutch listeners'
reactions, t1(46) = 2.29, p < .03; t2 (13) = 5.82, p < .001. After a back vowel no significant
difference was found between the subject groups, t1 (46)= 0.87, p > .3; t2 (13) = 2.11, p > .05.
For all 28 items the fricative [x] was on average 15 ms shorter after front vowels,
with an average length of 178 ms, than after back vowels with an average length of 193 ms,
t (13)= 2.14, p < .05. For Dutch subjects there was a significant correlation between duration
of the target fricative and RT after front vowels, r (14) = .7, p < .01; but none after back
vowels, r(14)= .34, p > .1. An ANCOVA on the item RTs using target duration as a covariate,
however, still found no effect of context, F2 (1, 26) = 2.27, p >.1.
The results of Experiment 2 indicate that there were no anomalies in the materials.
RTs of Dutch subjects did not differ in responses to nonwords containing a front or a back
vowel. It therefore remains to be explained why detection of a target segment which violated
a German phonotactic constraint was facilitated for German listeners in Experiment 1 rather
than inhibited as it was in previous studies (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1996; Gaskell &
Marslen-Wilson, 1998; Koster, 1987; Kuijpers & Van Donselaar, in preparation; Otake et
al., 1996). Three possibilities suggested themselves as sources for the facilitation effect.
One was that the listeners were attending to non- native stimuli. The second possibility
was the monosyllabic structure of the items. The third possibility was direction in which
the tested rule operated. Experiments 3 and 4 examined these possibilities.
Although other studies have addressed how knowledge of the phonological structure

of one's native language affects the perception of spoken non- native languages (see e.g.,
Cutler, Mehler, Norris, & Segui, 1986; Otake et al., 1996), they have not looked at the
effects of native assimilation rules on foreign language processing. In Otake et al. (1996),
for example, Dutch listeners were presented with Japanese materials with place assimilation violations. Although the items violated obligatory Japanese place assimilation for
nasals, they did not violate Dutch place assimilation rules (since the rule in Dutch is
optional). Experiment 1 is therefore the first experiment in which a native assimilation
rule was violated in non- native language materials. So it remains possible that the facilitation observed in Experiment 1 is due specifically to processes which operate when listeners
are presented with non- native language. Violation of a native assimilation rule may cause
facilitation when listening to a non-native language (as in Experiment 1), but not when
listening to one's native language.
Experiment 3 therefore investigated the same German fricative assimilation in a
phoneme- detection task with native speech stimuli. The German fricative assimilation rule
was violated in similar nonwords, this time pronounced in German by a native speaker of
German. Only German subjects were tested. The question was whether the facilitation effect
found in non-native listening for violation of the German fricative assimilation would still
be found when subjects were listening to their native language. Nonwords were used again
for compatibility with Experiments 1 and 2.
Experiments 1 and 2 are the first to test violation of assimilation in monosyllables.
To assess whether the findings of Experiment 1 might have been due to the monosyllabic
structure of the experimental items, fricative assimilation was tested in both monosyllabic
and bisyllabic items in Experiment 3. The monosyllabic items had the same structure as
the nonwords used in Experiments 1 and 2. In the bisyllabic items the target fricative [x]
occurred at the onset of the second syllable. So both the number of syllables and the position
of the target sound within a syllable changed.
The German fricative assimilation rule applies across a syllable boundary if the first
syllable ends in a vowel (i.e., if it is an open syllable). Whereas German rauchen `smoke'
is realized with a velar fricative as [rau.x@n] due to the preceding back vowel, German
kriechen `crawl' is realized with a palatal fricative as [kri:.C@n] due to the preceding front
vowel. The only exception to this rule is the diminutive suffix -chen, which is always realized
with the palatal fricative [C] . The diminutive form of Frau `woman' is therefore realized
with a palatal fricative as [frau.C@n] even though the first syllable is open and ends with a
back vowel. However, if the first syllable ends in a consonant (closed syllable), the second
syllable must begin with the palatal fricative [C] regardless of whether the vowel of the
first syllable is back or front. German horchen `hear' as well as Munchen `Munich' are
realized with the palatal fricative as [hOr.C@n] and [mYn.C@n] .
To sum up, Experiment 3 was designed in part to investigate whether processing
differences in non- native and native listening caused the facilitation effect for assimilation violation found in Experiment 1. The experiment also addressed whether syllable
membership and preceding context influence this processing.

Processing violation of assimilation

EXPERIMENT 3

Method
Subjects

Twenty- four students of the University of Regensburg took part in the experiment for a
small payment. They were all native speakers of German. None of them had participated
in Experiment 1.
Materials

The experiment was based very closely on Experiments 1 and 2. Again, a list of 28 monosyllabic items was selected with the help of the CELEX database. The same syllable
structure and the same vowels as in Experiment 1 and 2 were used. This time the items (as
German nonwords) only had to fulfill German constraints on word construction. As before,
14 of the nonwords with violation of assimilation contained the front vowels /E/ or /I/ .
Fourteen more nonwords with no violation contained the back vowels /a/ , /O/ , or /U/ .
In addition to the 28 monosyllabic items, 28 bisyllabic items were selected. The
bisyllabic items were also nonwords of German and also matched German constraints on
word construction. The first syllable of half of the items had the closed syllable structure
CVC or CCVC, where the vowel was either /E/ or /I/ and the syllable coda either of the
sonorant consonants /n/ or /l/ (such as *[plEnx@n] or *[ SpIlx@n] ). The other half of the
bisyllabic items had the open syllable structure CV or CCV in the first syllable with /u:/ ,
/o:/ , /a:/ or /au/ as its nucleus (such as [blu:x@n] ). The second syllable of all 28 bisyllabic
items was either [x@n] or [x@r] . Items with a closed first syllable violated a German
phonotactic constraint because the velar fricative [x] appeared as a syllable onset following
a closed syllable. Items with open first syllables contained no phonological violation. The
items, forming 14 matched pairs each for mono - and bi -syllabic nonwords, are listed in
Appendix 2.
A total of 254 filler nonwords were added to the materials. The filler material included both mono - and bi -syllabic nonwords. In 28 fillers the target fricative [x] occurred
at different positions across the nonwords. The palatal fricative [C] never occurred. Fillers
contained different German vowels, including all vowels used in the target items.
Four different pseudorandomized orders were constructed from the total set of 310
items. The items were constructed in such a way that each experimental item was preceded
by at least one non target- bearing filler. Fourteen representative practice items were
additionally created and were presented at the beginning of the experiment. There was a
pause between the practice list and the experimental items.
Procedure

All materials were read by a female native speaker of German in a sound- proof booth and
recorded on DAT tape. The speaker was also fluent in Dutch, which helped her to produce
the velar [x] after front vowels naturally.
All other details were as in Experiment 1 with one exception: digitized and labeled
stimuli were transferred as individual speech files to four pseudorandomized lists and rerecorded on DAT for presentation.

Subjects were tested one at a time in a sound- proof room. Instructions were given in
the same manner as in Experiment 1, except that the subjects were told that they would
hear German stimuli. Response times were measured from the onset of each target nonword.
Each subject heard the practice list first, followed, after a short pause, by one of the four
experimental lists. The experiment lasted about 16 minutes.
Results and Discussion

Prior to statistical analysis, RTs, which were originally measured from the onset of the
items, were adjusted so as to measure from the onset of the target fricative [x] . Missed
responses and one response to a monosyllabic item, which was slower than 1500 ms, were
treated as errors. Mean RTs and mean error rates for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic
nonwords are given in Table 3.
As in Experiment 1, German listeners detected [x] more quickly when a phonotactic
constraint was violated than when no violation occurred. RTs of monosyllabic and bisyllabic
items taken together were 524 ms in the legal context and 492 ms in the illegal context. A
combined analysis with both monosyllabic and bisyllabic items showed that the difference
in RTs was significant by subjects and by items, F1 (1, 23) = 18.44, p < .001; F2 (1, 13) =
9.69, p = .004. There was no interaction between number of syllables and context, F1, F2 < 1.
When evaluated separately, the difference in RTs for monosyllabic items was 25ms.
ANOVAs showed that this effect was significant by subjects, F1 (1, 23)= 9.60, p = .005, but
not by items, F2 (1, 13)= 2.91, p = .1. For two of the 14 monosyllabic pairs of items, average
RTs were considerably slower to the illegal item (by 50 ms in one case and 38 ms in the
other), contrasting with the overall pattern. When both pairs of items were excluded from
the ANOVA, there was a main effect of context for subjects and items, F1 (1, 23)= 16.10,
p = .001; F2 (1, 11) = 6.58, p < .03. The mean RTs after exclusion of these items were 481 ms
for illegal items and 519 ms for legal items.
For the remaining 12 monosyllabic pairs of items the duration of the target fricative
was measured and was on average 14 ms shorter after front vowels, with an average length
of 164 ms, than after back vowels, with an average length of 178 ms, t (11) = 2.71, p < .02.
There was no significant correlation between duration of the fricative and RTs after either
back vowels, r(12)= .24, p > .5, or front vowels, r (12)= .48, p = .1. An error analysis revealed
no significant main effect.
Inspection of the means of the first and the second formant in target items with front

108

Processing violation of assimilation

vowels and fillers with the same vowels but no velar fricative showed that there was no
lowering or backing of the vowels before the velar fricative which could have functioned
as a cue for the upcoming target fricative.
In bisyllabic nonwords listeners detected the target fricative [x] on average 38 ms
faster when a phonotactic constraint was violated than when no such violation occurred.
The difference was significant both by subjects and by items, F1 (1, 23)= 11.43, p = .003;
F2 (1, 13)= 7.03, p = .02. An error analysis revealed no significant main effect.
Duration of the target fricative in the 14 bisyllabic pairs of items did not contribute
to the effect. Average lengths of the target fricative after front and after back vowels were
both 131 ms.
Since there were intervening consonants between the front vowels and the velar
fricatives in the bisyllabic targets (/n/ or /l/ ), no lowering or backing of the front vowels
was expected and therefore no comparison between first and second formant was done.4
Thus, if violation of assimilation occurred, a facilitation effect appeared in native
and non-native listening, in mono - and bi -syllabic items, for target sounds in initial and
penultimate position, and for target sounds preceded by either a vowel or a consonant. But
so far facilitation for assimilation violation has been found only for German listeners,
whereas inhibition was found for Japanese, Dutch, and English listeners. Another difference
between the assimilation tested here and those in the previous literature lies in the direction
in which the assimilation rule operates. German fricative assimilation operates progressively, whereas earlier experiments tested assimilation rules that operate regressively.
Regressive assimilation narrows the number of legal second segments to a small set (few
legal continuations), while progressive assimilation does not (many legal continuations)
but rather explicitly excludes one certain continuation. Accordingly, listeners can have
different kinds of expectations about the upcoming segment. The defeat of the expectations
might be processed differently as a result. Is the facilitation effect for violation of assimilation due to the German fricative assimilation being progressive instead of regressive, or
is it because the listeners are German? In Experiment 4, a German regressive assimilation
rule was tested to investigate this question.
Place assimilation for nasals was chosen as the German regressive assimilation rule.
This rule has been tested before for Japanese by Otake et al. (1996). Regressive place assimilation for nasals is seen as the spreading of the place feature of a stop to the preceding
nasal (see Wiese, 1996), so that the nasal becomes homorganic with the following stop.
Regressive place assimilation for nasals is obligatory within German syllables only for the
velar stop /k/ and for the bilabial stop /p/ : thus German Bank `bank' must be realized as
[baIk] but not as *[bank] or *[bamk] . German Lump `rogue' must be realized as [lUmp]
but not as *[lUIp] or *[lUnp].
4

Another possibility was that subjects learned to detect the anomalous sequence in the course of
the experiment. For Experiments 1, 2, and 3 the RTs were split up into four groups depending on
the position of the corresponding item in the experiment. No significant interaction was found
between position of the corresponding item in the experiment and context, with one exception:
in the bisyllabic items in Experiment 3 an interaction suggested that listeners were learning to
detect the fricative in the legal context, but not in the illegal context.

In Experiment 4, German subjects had to detect either the target phoneme /k/ or the
target phoneme /p/ in three different types of monosyllabic German nonwords. The experimental items were nonwords again, for comparison with Experiments 1, 2, and 3. They
were monosyllabic because place assimilation for nasals in German is only obligatory within
syllables. In one type of nonword, the stop was preceded by the correctly assimilated
nasal, while in the two other types, the stops were preceded by two different unassimilated
nasals. The German phoneme repertoire contains three nasals /n/ , /I/ and /m/ (which are
distinctive in syllable final position).
EXPERIMENT 4

Method
Subjects

Forty- eight students from the University of Regensburg, all native speakers of German,
were tested. They were paid for their participation. Twenty- four of the subjects had the
target phoneme /k/ ; the other 24 had the target phoneme /p/ .
Materials

A list of 84 monosyllabic items was selected with the help of the CELEX database (Baayen
et al., 1993). All items were German nonwords, which were constructed of legal onset
consonants and clusters, had a CVCC or CCVCC structure and contained short vowels only.
Forty-two of the items ended in the velar stop /k/ . In 14 of those the stop was preceded by
the assimilated velar nasal /I/ (such as in [fEIk] ). Fourteen items violated the nasal place
assimilation, in that /k/ was preceded by the alveolar nasal /n/ (such as in *[fEnk] ). Fourteen
more contained violations in that /k/ was preceded by the bilabial nasal /m/ (such as in
*[fEmk] ). The other half of the 84 items ended in the bilabial stop /p/ . In 14 of those
nonwords the stop was preceded by the assimilated bilabial nasal /m/ (such as in [flOmp] ).
Fourteen nonwords with the velar nasal /I/ showed violation of assimilation (such as
*[flOIp] ). In the last 14 nonwords, also containing violation, the alveolar nasal /n/ occurred
in penultimate position (such as in *[flOnp] ). Both for the nonwords ending in /k/ and for
the nonwords ending in /p/ it was possible to find 14 matched triplets (see Appendix 3).
In addition 226 fillers were added to the materials, consisting of both mono -and bi syllabic legal nonwords. In more than 200 items the target phonemes /k/ and /p/ did not
occur. In the rest of the fillers the target phonemes occurred in a variety of positions in the
nonwords. The three nasals /n/ , /m/ and /I/ occurred altogether 150 times in the fillers. The
experimental items and the fillers were then used to construct four lists. Each list contained
all 310 items in a different pseudorandom order, such that there was always at least one non
target - bearing filler before an experimental item. A list of 14 practice items was also
constructed with similar materials, which was presented at the beginning of the experiment.
As before, there was a pause between the practice list and the experimental list.

Processing violation of assimilation

Procedure

All nonwords were recorded by the same female native speaker of German as in
Experiment 3. The speaker was trained beforehand to produce the illegal sequences */nk/,
*/mk/, */np/ and */Ip/ correctly in monosyllabic nonwords. Although experimental items
were read two or three times and the best recording was chosen, in some items a short
click sound was audible between the nasal and the stop. Epenthetic stops can appear in these
environments because of mistiming of articulators (Ohala, 1995). This happened in four
items containing the sequence */nk/, in four more items containing the sequence */mk/
and in five items containing the sequence */Ip/. In order to avoid the possibility of subjects
responding to these instead of the actual target stops, these clicks were removed by cutting
them out of the nonwords. The spliced utterances were played to two native listeners of
German who reported that they sounded as natural to them as unspliced utterances.
After digitizing the speech materials using Xwaves, the nonword boundaries and the
release of the stops in the experimental items were labeled. As in Experiment 3, a portable
computer with NESU experiment control software was used for the timing and data
collection and stimuli were played from a DAT recorder over headphones.
Subjects were tested singly in a sound -proof room. The subjects with /k/ as target
were asked to press the button in front of them with their preferred hand as fast as possible
if they detected the target stop /k/ , the other subjects were instructed to react to the target
stop /p/ . Response times were measured from the onset of each target nonword. Subjects
heard the practice list first, followed after a short pause by one of the four experimental
list. The whole experiment lasted about 16 minutes.
Results and Discussion

As in Experiments 1, 2, and 3, RTs were adjusted so as to measure in Experiment 4 from
the burst of the target phoneme. Missed responses and RTs outside the range of 100
to 1500 ms were again treated as errors. Altogether 13 responses were treated as errors
because they lay outside the evaluated range of RTs. One subject who monitored for /p/
missed 67 of all stops. Since missed responses spread over all three types of nonwords, it
was decided to exclude his RTs from the analysis. The results for phoneme detection of
the velar stop /k/ and the bilabial stop /p/ are shown in Table 4.
Listeners detected the target stops more slowly when they were preceded by nonhomorganic nasals than when no violation occurred. A two factor mixed ANOVA was used,
with the target stop as the between subjects factor and the nasal as the repeated measures
factor. There was a highly significant main effect of nasal, F1 (2, 90) = 17.68, p < .001;
F2 (2, 52)= 10.46, p < .001, but no main effect of stop was found.
Since both the bilabial and the velar nasal differ with respect to legality depending
on the following stop (whereas the alveolar nasal does not), the factors nasal and target were
expected to interact and indeed a highly significant interaction of nasal and target was found
in the two factor mixed ANOVA, F1 (2, 90)= 84.12, p < .001; F2 (2, 52)= 44.71, p < .001.
For both target stops strong inhibition effects for violation of assimilation were
observed when analyzed separately. With the repeated measures factor nasal as the only
factor, RTs to both /k/ and /p/ still showed a highly significant main effect of preceding

F1 (2, 44) = 75.44, p < .001; F2 (2, 26) = 33.66, p < .001).
An overall analysis of errors revealed a significant main effect of nasal by subjects
but not by items, F1 (2, 90)= 4.25, p < .02; F2 (2, 52) = 1.88, p >.1 . However, it also yielded
a significant effect of stop, F1 (1, 45) = 7.53, p = .009; F2 (1, 26) = 14, p = .001. Separate
analyses showed a significant effect of nasal by subjects for /p/, F1 (2, 44)= 5.79, p = .006;
F2 (2, 26) = 1.81, p >.1, but not for /k/, F1 (2, 46) = 1.31, p >.2; F2 (2, 26) = 1.77, p >.1 .
Obviously subjects had some difficulty detecting the target stop /p/ . This difficulty might
partly be due to the fact that in German monosyllabic words ending with p- final clusters
are much less frequent than monosyllabic words ending with k-final clusters. In addition,
of the various stops /p/ is most likely to be confused with other nonstops because of weaker
perceptual cues (Ohala, 1996).
Planned comparisons for the reaction time data and the error rates revealed the same
effects as those found in the preceding analyses.
Overall neither the length of the target stop /k/ nor of the target stop /p/ were found
to have contributed to the effects discovered. Although /k/ was longer after /m/ (131 ms)
than after /I/ (102 ms), t (13)= 2.91, p < .02, or /n/ (107 ms), t (13)= 2.23, p < .05, none of
the contexts yielded a significant correlation of stop length with detection time. Similarly,
although /p/ was longer after /I/ (99 ms) than after /m/ (81 ms), t (13)= 2.80, p < .02, with
an intermediate length after /n/ (91 ms), target length did not correlate with detection time.
To sum up, Experiment 4 replicated the inhibiting effect of regressive assimilation
violation found in earlier studies. German subjects detected the target stop /k/ or /p/
more slowly if the preceding nasal was not homorganic.
GENERAL DISCUSSION

The aim of the present study was to investigate how violation of different obligatory assimilation rules affects spoken-language processing. Previous research had consistently found
an inhibition effect for processing violation of obligatory assimilation. But some aspects
of assimilation were not examined in those studies. First, the effects of violating native
assimilation rules in a non- native language were unknown. Second, assimilation had
never been tested within syllables. Third, violations of progressive rather than regressive
assimilation rules had never been tested. The present study therefore investigated the role
of these factors in the processing of assimilation violations.

Processing violation of assimilation

In Experiment 1, German listeners detected a target fricative in monosyllabic Dutch
nonwords. When nonwords violated the obligatory German progressive fricative assimilation rule, a facilitation effect was found rather than an inhibition effect. For Dutch listeners,
no native phonological violations were included in the target contexts, and accordingly in
Experiment 2 they showed no effect of context in their reactions to the target fricative. The
results of Experiments 1 and 2 are a confirmation of previous findings in the sense that the
process of listening is language -specific. Earlier studies have already reported evidence
that the process of listening in a non-native language is influenced by the native language
of the listener (see e.g., Cutler et al., 1986; Otake et al., 1996).
Experiment 3 investigated whether the observed facilitation effect in Experiment 1
was due to the non-native listening task or to the monosyllabic structure of the tested items.
The same German fricative assimilation rule was tested. German subjects again detected
a target fricative in illegal German sequences more quickly, in both monosyllabic and
bisyllabic items.
Experiment 4 showed that the necessary condition for facilitation in processing assimilation violations was the nature of the assimilation rule. Violations of regressive place
assimilation for German nasals showed slower not faster RTs to stops in illegal segment
strings. This matches the effect found in the previous literature for other languages (Gaskell
& Marslen-Wilson, 1996; Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1998; Koster, 1987; Kuijpers & Van
Donselaar, in preparation; Otake et al., 1996).
Both regressive and progressive assimilation form phonotactically legal segment
strings and violation of obligatory assimilation always results in phonotactically illegal
segment strings. It is in both cases at the second involved segment that the sequence becomes
illegal. So why does the violation make it easier in one case and harder in the other to
recognize the second segment? Part of the answer to this question can be found in the
different predictions which progressive and regressive assimilation make for the upcoming
second segment, the monitoring target.
The phonotactics of German do not allow German listeners hearing the front vowels
in Experiments 1 and 3 to have strong expectations for the next segment. For example /E/
in /kE-/ could have been followed by /f/, /k/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /I/, /p/, /r/, /s/, /S/, /t/, or [C].
Hearing /E-/, however, excluded [x] as the following segment. Similarly, hearing /n/ or /l/
in syllable final position in the first syllable of bisyllabic items in Experiment 3 did not
provoke strong expectations about the following syllable initial segment, but excluded [x] .
The forward operating assimilatory effect weakly restricted what the following segment
would be, while strongly excluding one certain segment.
In Experiment 4, on the other hand, German listeners hearing the velar nasal /I/ could
have strong expectations for the next segment. German phonology allows only a very
restricted set of segments to follow the velar nasal in coda position. In /fEI-/, for instance,
/I/ could have been followed by only three consonants, /k/ , /s/, and /t/ . Thus, the regressive
assimilatory effect strongly restricted what the following segment might be. This difference
in set restriction effects is true for all segment strings that result from obligatory assimilation, at least in the tested languages.
Thus although both kinds of assimilation violations form phonotactically illegal
sequences, progressive and regressive assimilation impose different kinds of constraints on

the second segment for the listener. Regressive assimilation results are the easier to explain.
Here the listener has strong expectations as soon as the first segment is identif ied. Two
tendencies could then be responsible for the present results. If the following legal segment
can be predicted before it actually occurs, detection of the correct segment may be facilitated
compared to the incorrect. Alternatively, when strong expectations are defeated by an illegal
segment, inhibition of the unexpected item may result, as it does in visual attention
experiments (Posner, Nissen, & Ogden, 1978).
For progressive assimilations, which defeat expectations, this explanation does not
apply. Instead, the explanation seems to lie in another difference between the illegal
sequences used here. Although both the illegal fricative and the illegal stop sequences
have zero transitional probabilities within words, the latter type do occur across word
boundaries (e.g., dem Kamm `the comb'). The former do not: no German word begins
with [x] . The fact that German listeners had never heard the sequence *[Ix] before in their
native language made this sequence a truly novel one for them. The difference between
entirely novel sequences which never occur in any environment in the language and
sequences which can occur in some environments in the language may be crucial.
Facilitation of processing for novel items is also reported in recent research on
spontaneous visual attention; specifically, novel items are reported to cause rapid orientation
(see also Christie & Klein, 1996). Johnston and colleagues have published several recent
articles (Johnston & Schwarting, 1996; Johnston & Schwarting, 1997) on this phenomenon,
which they have called "novel popout." They found that novel items were more accurately
localizable than familiar items when observers had a glimpse of a scene but were not looking
for anything in particular. Familiar items were visually- presented words that occurred
frequently and thus were expected to occur in the experiment, whereas novel items were
presented once and thus were not expected to occur in the experiment (novel items were
therefore not novel in an absolute sense since they were existing words in the subjects'
native language). According to Johnston, novel popout reflects the fact that novel items
receive some sort of processing priority and that this is an important adaptive process that
has evolved in early phylogenetic history (Johnston & Schwarting, 1997).
This adaptive process might explain why listeners in the present study were faster in
their detection of the target fricative (not absolutely novel by itself) if it occurred in a
sequence which was truly novel for the listeners. Listeners could not have had strong expectations about which segment would follow the front vowel /I/ in Experiments 1 and 3, but
since the following segment [x] was completely new for them in that context it stood out.
A number of subjects even reported after the experiment that the target fricative sometimes
"popped out." It appears to be the combination of weak expectations and the novel popout
effect that facilitated processing in Experiments 1 and 3. When a particular second segment
is strongly expected, novelty alone does yield facilitation, as the Japanese experiments on
violation of assimilation showed (Otake et al., 1996). In Japanese, nasals never mismatch
in place of articulation with a following stop, not even across word boundaries (Vance,
1987). Therefore Japanese listeners have, for example, never heard the sequence */mk/ in
their native language. After hearing /m/ they very strongly expected a labial to follow and
this expectation might have outweighed any novelty effects.
To sum up, facilitation for detection of a segment in a phonotactically illegal sequence
---------------------------------------------------------------- Language and Speech

114

Processing violation of assimilation

has been shown when listeners' weak expectations about an upcoming segment are defeated
and the sequence itself is absolutely novel for the listeners (Experiments 1, 2, and 3 of the
present study). Inhibition has been shown when listeners have strong expectations about
an upcoming segment which are defeated, but when the sequence itself is not absolutely
novel for the listeners (Experiment 4 of the present study and Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson,
1996; Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1998; Kuijpers & Van Donselaar, in preparation; Otake
et al., 1996). Otake et al., (1996) have also shown that detection of a segment that violates
phonotactic constraints is inhibited when listeners have strong expectations about an
upcoming segment and the sequence itself is a novel one for the listeners. How listeners
process a segment that runs counter to weak expectations in a sequence that is not novel
for the listeners has not been yet investigated. Following the explanation for the novel
popout, inhibition would be expected, since popout requires a truly novel sequence for the
listener. It is predicted that of all possible combinations of strong and weak expectations
with sequences which never occur in the language (absolutely novel) and sequences which
occur in other environments (not absolutely novel), only the combination of weak expectations together with a novel sequence causes facilitation in processing phonotactically
illegal sequences.
The facilitation effect for violation of progressive assimilation has been observed so
far only in a phoneme monitoring task. Listeners are specifically asked to focus their
attention on the recognition of a single sound. During the processing of spontaneous speech
in normal conversation, single sounds are usually not the focus of attention. Admittedly the
link between phoneme monitoring and real language processing is only an indirect one,
but in both cases listeners are presented with speech input which they have to process. There
is, at least, evidence for the inhibitory effect of assimilation violation from other tasks.
Koster(1987) and Gaskell and Marslen-Wilson (1996) observed inhibition for violation
of assimilation in word recognition tasks. The inhibition effect is therefore not specific to
phoneme monitoring, but whether the same is true for the facilitation effect is still a matter
for further investigation.
So far the facilitation effect has been shown for violation of progressive assimilation.
But interpretation of the effect depends on an assessment of its generality. If facilitation for
phoneme recognition is due to a weak set restriction effect in combination with novel popout,
then it might not be confined to assimilation violation. In fact, any other phonological
restriction causing weak set restrictions and novel popout for the following segment might
replicate the facilitation effect for violation of that restriction. In the same way, the inhibition
effect has been observed for processes other than violation of assimilation. If anticipatory
coarticulatory information fails to match the actual consonant which follows, processing has
been shown to be adversely affected (Marslen-Wilson & Warren, 1994; Martin & Bunnell,
1981; McQueen, Norris, & Cutler, 1999; Whalen, 1984; Whalen, 1991). In these studies,
performance on cross- spliced items that contain acoustic -phonetic mismatches was worse
than on matching items. In McQueen et al. (1999) for instance, items like sloop `pillowcase'
were made by splicing sloo from sloot `ditch' and adding the /p/ burst from sloop. Although
formant transitions in the vowel signaled an upcoming /t/ , the following segment was /p/ .
In other words, when hearing the vowel, the set of possible segments to follow was reduced
to /t/ , but /p/ occurred instead. Phonetic decision to the final stop was harder in items with
mismatching information than in items without mismatching information. Further investiLanguage and Speech ----------------------------------------------------------------

gations testing other phonological violations may show whether the facilitation effect can
be replicated in the same way for other phonological restrictions. This would suggest that
neither facilitation nor inhibition effects are assimilation -specific, but are rather general
phoneme sequence effects. Further investigation is also necessary to determine the exact
border between weak and strong set restriction effects.
The current study has shown evidence that the novel popout effect is operative not
only in visual perception but also in speech perception. In most current models of speech
perception, all sequences with zero transitional probability are treated equally, whether they
are impossible in all environments or only in the one in question. The results reported here
suggest that not all such sequences are processed in the same way. The finding of a novel
popout effect for speech perception adds to our knowledge of mechanisms listeners use. It
is hoped that future research will clarify the role of this effect.
