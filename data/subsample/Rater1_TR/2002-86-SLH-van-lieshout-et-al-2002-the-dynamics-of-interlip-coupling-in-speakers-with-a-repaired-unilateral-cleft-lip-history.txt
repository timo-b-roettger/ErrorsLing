In this paper, data are presented on individual movement characteristics of the
upper and lower lip and on interlip coordination in speakers with a repaired
unilateral cleft upper lip history and age-matched control participants. The data
were acquired using the AG100 EMMA system while the participants produced a
selection of nonspeech and speech tasks. The participants with a repaired
unilateral cleft upper lip history showed reduced upper-lip movement ranges and
peak velocities and a more variable spatiotemporal pattern for individual upperlip movement cycles, in addition to a more variable interlip coupling. The latter
difference also proved to be more pronounced for the younger speakers with a
repaired cleft upper lip. Overall, for both groups, the linguistically more complex
task showed more variability in the individual upper- and lower-lip movement
cycles and their coupling. In the discussion, we address the potential relationships
between the kinematic data for upper lip in the repaired-cleft-lip speakers and the
findings on movement and coordination stability as they might fit within current
notions of coordination dynamics theory.

he mechanisms underlying movement control have been the subject of many studies. In general, dating back to early work by Keele
(1982) and Schmidt (1975), movements are assumed to be under
direct control of a generalized motor plan, or GMP. This is an abstract
memory representation containing specific instructions to the brain regarding movement targets and temporal structure of the intended actions (Schmidt, Heuer, Ghodsian, & Young, 1998). In the past 15 years,
the concept of motor plans has been challenged by researchers who have
adopted a synergistic or coordination dynamics approach (Kelso, 1998;
Turvey, 1990). As the name indicates, this approach focuses on movement coordination, which is seen as an "a posteriori consequence of evolving processes of self-organization or pattern formation" (p. 302, Kelso,
1994). In the first section of this introduction, we will describe this approach and some of its most relevant claims before addressing our motivation to use this approach in the present study.

Coordination Dynamics: A Synopsis
Coordination can be defined at many levels, and it can vary from
simple to highly complex patterns of interaction (Turvey, 1990). In all

these cases, the combined degrees of freedom are functionally constrained to act as a single unit. For speech
production, Browman and Goldstein (1992) proposed
that such units exist in the form of gestures. Gestures
relate abstract specifications of vocal tract constriction
location and constriction degree to combined actions of
specific articulators, such as the lips and jaw for bilabial closure (Saltzman & Kelso, 1987). According to the
coordination dynamics theory (Kelso, 1995, 1998), coordination patterns are governed by lawful mechanisms
of the coupling itself. These mechanisms can be modeled in a "phase space" that describes all the possible
states of a dynamic system and how they evolve in time.
A given system will have preferred settings in this phase
space, which are referred to as attractor states. In general, depending on the task requirements and task conditions (e.g., rate of movements) as well as the specifics
of the coupling itself, the coupled system, regardless of
the initial conditions from which it originated, will after some initial settling converge to or remain close to
one of the attractor states (Kelso, 1995).
These inherently stable solutions are also assumed
to underlie the capability of a coupled system to compensate for dynamic or static perturbations as they are
introduced to the motor and/or sensory systems either
experimentally or by natural occurring events. In
speech, studies have shown that if the lower lip or jaw
is artificially perturbed during an ongoing bilabial closing movement, the compensation is immediate and task
specific (Abbs, Folkins, & Sivarajan, 1976; Abbs &
Gracco, 1983; Folkins & Zimmermann, 1982; Kelso,
Tuller, Vatikiotis-Bateson, & Fowler, 1984), even under conditions of reduced proprioceptive, tactile, and
acoustic feedback (Kelso & Tuller, 1983). The nature
and extent of compensation may differ as a function of
sound class and type of perturbation (e.g., Baum &
McFarland, 1997; Geumann, Kroos, & Tillmann, 1999).
However, there is ample evidence that for a particular
task, such as lip closing in bilabial gestures, individual
articulators follow task-specific lawful dynamic constraints that will pull them toward a specific coordination pattern (Kelso et al., 1984; Kelso & Tuller, 1984;
Nittrouer, Munhall, Kelso, Tuller, & Harris, 1988; van
Lieshout, Hijl, & Hulstijn, 1999; van Lieshout, Hulstijn,
Alfonso, & Peters, 1997).
However, unlike machines, which are required to
perform a certain task in the same way and with (preferably) zero tolerance, biological systems require a certain amount of flexibility to adapt to changes in the environment and/or functional requirements. The coupling
between individual structures provides the system with
a task-specific optimization of information and energy
flow within the boundaries of the existing conditions.
Thus, it not only captures biomechanical or energetic

6

properties of the involved system, but also the intent of
the action itself (Kelso, 1995, 1997). Changing conditions, task requirements, or intention will potentially
force a system to probe other solutions. For example, in
changing the rate of movements, the system at some
point will show a destabilization of the existing state
and often soon thereafter will spontaneously switch to
another state, as demonstrated in limb control (Haken,
Kelso, & Bunz, 1985), as well as for certain speech tasks
(Tuller & Kelso, 1990). In fact, it is the focus on temporal stability and how it changes under the influence of
specific coupling parameters that differentiates coordination dynamics from GMP approaches (Kelso, 1997).
Whereas fluctuations in coordination patterns are
treated as the result of mostly unwanted neuromotor
noise in GMP approaches (see, for example, Van Galen
& van Huygevoort, 2000), coordination dynamics embodies fluctuations as a natural mechanism that helps
a system to probe new solutions in accordance to task,
system, and environmental requirements (Kelso, 1997;
Mpitsos, 2000; Mpitsos, Creech, Cohan, & Mendelson,
1988). Different coordination patterns, fluctuations,
abrupt or continuous changes from one pattern to another, recruitment of redundant degrees of freedom, all
these phenomena can be modeled and predicted within
the scope of coordination dynamics (Fink, Kelso, Jirsa,
& de Guzman, 2000; Kelso, 1997). That is, coordination
dynamics not only offers new ways to investigate how a
system behaves but also examines why it may change its
behavior. We think that this view of coordination is very
suitable to describe and explain the characteristics of
movement control in normal speakers and in speakers
with communication disorders (van Lieshout et al., 1997).
In the remainder of this introduction, we will address
how coordinative dynamics theory can guide the search
for mechanisms in speech production that potentially
relate to functional limitations in orofacial structures.

Coordination Dynamics: In Search of
(De)stabilizing Mechanisms
In limb control studies, it has been found that differences between limbs in terms of their biomechanical
characteristics influenced the stability of the limb coupling (Jeka & Kelso, 1995; Serrien & Swinnen, 1998).
Coupling stability has also been found to relate to movement amplitude. Small amplitudes (in the primary motion direction) may destabilize an existing coupling and
induce transitions to different coordination patterns (de
Guzman, Kelso, & Buchanan, 1997; Fink et al., 2000;
Peper & Beek, 1998a, 1998b). From these findings in
limb control, is seems reasonable to extrapolate the
same mechanisms to speech, namely that differences
in intrinsic properties of the individual articulators in

speech will bear upon the nature and stability of their
coupling.
In the current study, we wanted to investigate the
functional aspects of potential structural limitations in
a specific articulator, the upper lip, on movement control and coupling dynamics in speech production. For
that purpose, we selected a group of people who have a
history of a unilateral cleft upper lip. The cleft was repaired at a very early age, that is, before the first year
after birth. The repaired upper lip differs from a "normal" upper lip in its reduced elasticity and height, which
according to some authors may lead to increased lip pressure on the maxilla, thus potentially impeding its normal development (Bardach, 1990; Bardach, Klausner,
& Eisbach, 1979; Goz, Joos, & Schilli, 1987; Ravera et
al., 2000; Susami, Kamiyama, Uji, Motohashi, & Kuroda,
1993). A reported retruded position of the pre-maxilla
seems to confirm this claim (Hermann, Jensen, Dahl,
Bolund, & Kreiborg, 2000; Zuniga et al., 2000). Additional evidence comes from surface EMG studies that
showed elevated muscle activity in the repaired upper
lip (Genaro, Trindade, & Trindade, 1994; Ravera et al.,
2000). By extension, there is a larger difference in intrinsic properties between the upper and lower lip for
these participants compared to speakers with no cleftlip history. In particular, movement amplitudes of their
upper lip may be significantly reduced for lip-closing
tasks, introducing a potentially destabilizing influence
on lip coupling, as suggested by findings in limb control
(Fink et al., 2000; Peper & Beek, 1998a, 1998b).
It is important to note here that in this study we
are not concerned with the biomechanical properties of
the upper lip of our participants as such. Our focus will
be on the functional aspects of the surgical intervention
that took place at an early stage of development in our
participants. There are no published data, to our knowledge, that show if and how this affects the kinematics of
the upper lip in meaningful (lip closing) tasks. In an
EMG study by Ravera et al. (2000), the repaired-cleftlip participants showed differences in EMG signal output for resting positions and saliva swallowing, but not
for bilabial closing gestures in simple speech tasks. This
fits the claim that participants with repaired unilateral
cleft lip in general show no perceptual impairment for
bilabial sounds (Kuehn & Moller, 2000). It may also reflect lower-lip superiority in terms of fine force control,
strength, and precision of movement (Barlow & Netsell,
1986). These authors claim that if the upper lip is compromised, the "lower lip is particularly well suited for
assuming a greater proportion of the kinematic demands
involved in achieving lip closure" (p. 167). However,
subperceptual differences may still exist (cf. Kent, 1996)
in the way upper-lip limitations challenge the speech
motor system in performing a given task.

Purpose of This Study
This study aimed for an objective functional assessment of potential differences in upper- and lower-lip kinematics and lip coupling in people with a repaired cleft
upper lip and control speakers. Apart from traditional
kinematic measures (amplitude, peak velocity, duration),
we included measures of movement cycle stability (cyclic
Spatio-Temporal Index or cSTI, see Smith & Goffman,
1998; van Lieshout & Moussa, 2000) and interlip coordination (relative phase). The latter measure was chosen
because it reflects underlying (relatively) stable states
as well as qualitative changes in states without being
influenced by ongoing transient changes in surface characteristics of the coupled structures, like variations in
movement durations (Kelso, Saltzman, & Tuller, 1986;
Saltzman, Lofqvist, Kay, Kinsella-Shaw, & Rubin, 1998;
van Lieshout et al., 1997). Based on the literature on
the effects of upper-lip surgical repair, we hypothesized
that people with a repaired unilateral cleft lip history,
when compared to matched control speakers, would show
1.

smaller upper-lip (UL) movement amplitudes and
peak velocities;

2.

larger lower-lip (LL) movements and higher peak
velocities (compensation for 1);

3.

more variable movements patterns for UL, but not
for LL, as assessed by the cSTI; and

4.

more variable lip coupling, as indicated by greater
variability in relative phase.

To vary the demands on the speech motor system,
we used a nonverbal lip-closing task and verbal stimuli,
which differ in linguistic complexity (disyllabic nonwords
and short sentences).

Method
Participants
Nine experimental participants (RCL) were selected
from a population of patients with repaired unilateral
cleft upper lip, known to the Department of Plastic Surgery at the University Hospital of Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Their cleft lip was repaired within the first year
of life1 (see Schendel, 2000, for an overview of surgical
techniques used in cleft-lip repair). The RCL group consisted of 6 female and 3 male participants, whereas the
control group (CON) consisted of 2 male and 2 female
participants. All participants spoke Dutch as their first

Three of the participants with repaired cleft upper lip underwent a
secondary upper-lip surgery at the time of this study (Millard technique) to
improve the results of the early first repair regarding lip length and muscle
continuity (Rutjens, Spauwen, & van Lieshout, 2001). The data used in this
study are taken before their secondary surgery to make sure that for all
participants the effects that are found are related to the first repair.

language. All participants and their parents reported
normal hearing, language, and cognitive functions. At
the time this study was performed, none of the participants had received any speech treatment; they produced
normal intelligible speech, with a slight nasal quality
for some of the participants, which is in line with reports in the literature (Kuehn & Moller, 2000). The average age for our RCL participants was 15.8 years (SD
= 3.3; range = 11-21 years) and for our CON participants 17.8 years (SD = 3.9; range = 14-23 years). Participants were similar with respect to educational level.
People with a repaired cleft upper lip often show a
retracted maxilla position (Hermann et al., 2000; Zuniga
et al., 2000). We could not measure this directly, but
the difference in horizontal resting position between
upper and lower lip (slightly touching each other) gives
a rough estimate. These values are based on rotated
EMMA coil positions measured at the midline of both
lips (see Procedures and Analysis below). As expected,
all RCL speakers had positive values (mean = 4.96 mm,
SD = 2.82 mm, range = 0.4 to 9.6 mm), indicating a receded upper-lip position; all control speakers showed
negative values (mean = -1.33 mm, SD = 0.97 mm, range
= -0.6 to -2.7 mm), indicating an advanced upper-lip
position.

Tasks
All participants performed seven different tasks.
These included a nonspeech task in which participants
had to open and close their lips with front teeth clenched
in order to immobilize the lower jaw ("lips" task). In addition, we used two different disyllabic nonword speech
tasks ([api] and [ipa]) and four different short sentence
tasks, matched for number of words and syllables:
1.

[bObi b"Nt bananEn b"i pa] "Bobby brings bananas to
dad."

2.

[bl"idE bebis bAbElEn b"st] "Happy babies babble
best."

3.

[bOlE pit br"it bOntE p"tEn] "Bulky Pete knits colorful
caps."

4.

[papi blast bAlOnEn m"t pYf] "Daddy blows balloons
with (a) puff."

The nonspeech and two-syllable tasks used a reiterative task paradigm in which participants had to repeat a task for a total of 12 seconds while starting at a
rate slightly slower than their normal preferred rate and
going faster in a self-selected continuous fashion (van
Lieshout et al., 1997). There were four trials for each of
these tasks. The sentences were produced four times in
a row in a single trial at a normal rate and loudness
level. There were two trials for each sentence. The order of tasks was as follows: lips - [api] - [ipa] - [api] -
8

[ipa] - lips - sentence 1 - sentence 2 - sentence 3 -
sentence 4. This block of trials was repeated a second
time.
Real speech obviously does not involve simple repetitions of a single task, but speech production does show
rhythmic behavior at almost all levels (Buder, 1996).
We adhere to the view that speech movements can be
described and quantified as dynamic oscillators coupled
in a nonlinear way to produce simple or highly complex
patterns (Kelso, 1995; van Lieshout & Moussa, 2000).
The existence of such dynamic neural oscillators has
been suggested for other types of motor control (Fuchs,
Jirsa, Haken, & Kelso, 1996).

Procedures
Before starting the experimental tasks, we collected
data on the occlusal bite plane, using a plastic device (bite
plate) to which two coils were attached in the midline at
a fixed distance of 3 cm. Participants simply held the
device in their mouth using their teeth. The upper and
lower incisors touched the device just behind the posterior coil (cf. van Lieshout & Moussa, 2000). Once the
person was seated and informed about the procedures,
the sensors were attached to the anatomical locations
described below. Subsequently, a specially designed inner helmet was positioned on the participant's head. This
inner helmet is tightly connected to the participant's
head and to the outer helmet so that possible head movements are closely followed by the entire structure. This
way, the need for reference coils on upper jaw and nose
is less stringent,2 allowing all five sensor coils to be used
for monitoring speech-related movements (Alfonso,
Neely, van Lieshout, Hulstijn, & Peters, 1993).
In the present study, coils were attached to the midline of the vermilion border of upper and lower lip, the
mandible,3 the tongue blade (1 cm behind the tongue
tip), and finally, the tongue body (3 cm behind the tongueblade coil). All five coils were attached with CyanoVeneer, a cyano-acrylate-based skin glue. Lower-lip signals were corrected for jaw movements using an estimate of jaw rotation based on the principal component
of the mandible sensor coil trajectory for each trial.
Compared to a simple subtraction method, which ignores jaw rotation, this method reduces positional and
speed errors by roughly 65-70% (Westbury, McClean, &
Lindstrom, 2000). In this paper, we will only focus on
lower-lip movements that are corrected for jaw influences using the method described above.
2

In addition, all our measures described in this study are based on
relative positions, which are neutral with respect to head movements.

The coil to measure mandible movements was attached to a thin plastic
(Vinyl Polysiloxan Putty, 3M Express STD) mold, custom made to fit
snugly and firmly to the lower incisors of a participant.

Instrumentation

Analysis

Time-aligned audio and Electromagnetic Midsagittal Articulography (EMMA) signals were acquired using the Nijmegen version of the Carstens AG100 system (Alfonso et al., 1993). In EMMA, three transmitters
create an alternating magnetic field. When a sensor coil
is placed in this field, an alternating voltage is induced
in the sensor. The distance between the transmitter and
the sensor is directly related to the amplitude of the signal induced in this sensor (Hasegawa-Johnson, 1998;
Schonle et al., 1987). The AG100 system has a high temporal and spatial (<0.35 mm) resolution. Small deviations or rotations from the midline position can be corrected based on the signal of the third transmitter. All
movement data were sampled at 400 Hz, whereas acoustic speech data were acquired simultaneously through
the EMMA system at 16 kHz.

Movement data were smoothed with an 11-point
triangular filter (effective low-pass frequency 27.5 Hz)
before data processing. Using the information on the
participant's occlusal plane, data were rotated to align
them with the EMMA measuring field horizontal axis.
This way, a uniform coordinate reference frame was established for all participants (cf. Westbury, 1994). All
movement signals were bandpass filtered between
0.1 Hz (removing slow varying drifts) and 6 Hz (all relevant frequencies were found below this cut-off point)
using a 7th-order Hamming window Butterworth filter. For the relative phase analysis (Figure 1), positive
position and velocity signals of the upper lip and lower
lip were amplitude normalized between 0 and 1; negative values were normalized between 0 and -1. From

Figure 1. Relative phase signal for a repeated sequence of [api]. The graph shows (from top to bottom):
normalized upper-lip (UL) and lower-lip (LL) amplitude, normalized upper-lip and lower-lip velocity, upperlip and lower-lip phase across time, and relative phase.

the normalized position and velocity functions, we calculated phase-time functions. Finally, relative phase
values were derived by subtracting individual phasetime functions of upper and lower lip (Kelso et al., 1986;
Meulenbroek, Thomassen, van Lieshout, & Swinnen,
1998; van Lieshout & Moussa, 2000).
As shown in Figure 1, for this participant the initial part of the trial shows more variable relative phase
patterns compared to the middle and end part of the
trial. Since this participant (as per instruction) was
speaking faster while completing the trial (notice a reduction in cycle durations in upper- and lower-lip position signals), it is possible that the slower rates induced
a somewhat more variable pattern (cf. van Lieshout &
Moussa, 2000).
For our analysis, we selected the best trial for a given
task based on absence of errors in performance and/or
disfluencies and the lowest overall circular standard
deviation in relative phase. Furthermore, from the four

sentence tasks, we only used the "bobby" task for further analysis, because it showed the most stable performance for all our participants. The selected trial for a
given task was divided in 1-second consecutive intervals (400 samples each), for each one of which we calculated an average phase angle and its standard deviation using circular statistics (Batschelet, 1981). For the
four tasks used in this study, the average numbers of
intervals (the standard deviation is in parentheses)
across all participants were "lips," 9.0 (0.67); [api], 9.0
(0.94); [ipa], 8.8 (0.42); and "bobby," 6.1 (1.6). From these
calculated intervals, we took the median value for both
the average relative phase and the standard deviation
of relative phase to avoid a bias by outliers, which for
example could be induced by slow rates or initial trial
conditions (see above).
Using upper- and lower-lip position and velocity signals, we also calculated the following kinematic measures (see Figure 2 for details):

Figure 2. Graph showing upper-lip position, upper-lip velocity, lower-lip position, and lower-lip velocity for
the same utterance as displayed in Figure 1 ([api]). The marked positions indicate the values used for
calculating upper-lip amplitude (average of amplitude difference between marker positions 1-2 and 2-3),
upper-lip peak velocity (average of peak-velocity values at A and B), and upper-lip cycle duration (interval
between 1 and 3), as well as lower-lip amplitude (average of amplitude difference between marker
positions 4-5 and 5-6), lower-lip peak velocity (average of peak-velocity values at C and D), and lower-lip
cycle duration (interval between 4 and 6).

These measures are commonly used in speech motor research (e.g., see Munhall, Ostry, & Parush, 1985).
For practical reasons, we did not make a further distinction between opening and closing movement durations, amplitudes, and peak velocities, since in this type
of reiterative task the differences are small and for the
purpose of our study not relevant.
The markers that are displayed in Figure 2 are
derived from automated peak-picking algorithms that

detect peaks and valleys in the position and velocity signals using relative amplitude (proportion of maximum
amplitude) and time (minimum interval between successive events) criteria. The parameters for the criteria
were determined by calculating a cyclic spatiotemporal
index or cSTI (cf. Smith, Goffman, Zelaznik, Ying, &
McGillem, 1995) with different parameter combinations.
For each parameter combination, individual cycles as
defined by the peaks and valleys in the signal were
amplitude and time normalized and aligned with each
other (Figure 3). Separate standard deviations for the
overlapping segments are then computed at 2% intervals in relative time, the sum of which defines cSTI. This
index provides a measure for the uniformity of a cyclic
movement pattern. The computer selected the amplitude and time parameter combination that generated
the lowest cSTI. This procedure provides an objective
method for separating individual cycles in speech movement data (van Lieshout & Moussa, 2000).
Using a method similar to the relative phase measure method, we took median values from the kinematic
measures as they were calculated per movement cycle
for the selected trials, as described above. We also used

Figure 3. Example of cyclic spatiotemporal index (cSTI) for the same utterance as displayed in Figure 1
([api]). The graph shows (from top to bottom): lower-lip (LL) position across time, segmented individual
cycles overlaid across time, the same segments amplitude normalized, and finally, the amplitudenormalized segments across a time-normalized x axis with the derived cSTI value.

the lowest cSTI values to evaluate the stability of individual upper- and lower-lip movements in our experimental and control group, separately for each task. Finally, we calculated a measure that we think reflects
the amount of symmetry between upper lip and lower
lip in terms of movement characteristics. Ideally, one
would like to access asymmetries as they relate to differences in the (natural) frequencies of the coupled elements in a synergy (cf. Jeka & Kelso, 1995; Kelso & Jeka,
1992; Treffner & Turvey, 1996). Unfortunately, given the
age of our participants, the types of tasks, and the type
of instrumentation used, we could not employ a similar
setup in this study. To approach the issue of symmetry
from another angle, we use the ratio between upper-lip
and lower-lip cSTI, assuming that differences in cSTI
between both lips reflect asymmetry at the level of spatiotemporal control between these coupled structures.
Obviously, when the two lips are similar in their cyclic
pattern stability, the ratio should approach 1. When the

upper lip is more variable than the lower lip, values
should be higher than 1, and lower than 1 when the
reverse situation is true.
Repeated measures ANOVA (using NCSS 2000;
Hintze, 1998) was used to test for Group (RCL and CON
participants) and within-subject Task ("lips," [api], [ipa],
"bobby") effects, separately for upper-lip and lower-lip
measures at an  level of .05. For significant Task effects, we applied Tukey's post hoc tests.

Kinematic Measures
For the amplitude of the upper lip (UL), we found a
trend for smaller amplitudes in our speakers with a cleft
upper lip history [F(1, 11) = 3.49, p = .089]. As shown in
Figure 4A for the individual data, 2 RCL speakers
showed larger upper-lip amplitudes than any of the
other participants, with the exception of the oldest control participant (#13). However, all other RCL speakers showed smaller amplitudes than did the control
speakers, although some of the differences were small
(compare Participants #9 and #10). Although on average the lower-lip amplitudes were larger for the RCL
speakers (Table 1), the Group effect was not significant
[F(1, 11) = 3.04, p = n.s.]. We did find a significant Task
effect [F(3, 32) = 3.14, p < .039]. Post hoc testing revealed
a significant difference between the [api] and "bobby"
tasks (p < .05), with the latter showing smaller lowerlip amplitudes.

within-trial standard deviations of relative phase (C) for individual
participants with a repaired cleft upper lip (1) and control participants (0). Participants are arranged according to age from left to
right, with age at time of experiment indicated above the x axis.
Error bars indicate standard deviation across the four tasks.

Parallel to the Group trend for upper-lip amplitude,
we found a significant Group effect for upper-lip peak
velocity [F(1, 11) = 4.66, p = .05], with smaller peak velocities for the RCL speakers (Table 1). For the lower
lip, no Group effect was found. Cycle durations showed
no effects for either upper lip or lower lip (F < 1), indicating that participants from both groups had comparable movement rates for the different tasks in the midrange of their task performances (remember, the values
are based on medians).
For cyclic pattern variability (cSTI), we found a significant Group effect for upper lip [F(1, 11) = 5.56, p <
.05], but not for lower lip [F(1, 11) = 0.62, p = n.s.]. The
upper-lip cSTI values for the individual RCL speakers
were consistently higher, except when compared to control speaker #10, as shown in Figure 4B. Task effects
were found for upper lip [F(3, 32) = 15.78, p < .001] and
lower lip [F(3, 32) = 26.40, p < .001] (Table 1). Post hoc
tests revealed that for the upper-lip, cSTI values were
significantly higher (p < .05) for the "bobby" task compared to the other three tasks and for the "lips" task
compared to the [api] task. For the lower lip, only the
"bobby" task showed higher cSTI values compared to
the other three tasks. In comparing the arcsine-transformed ratios of upper-lip and lower-lip cSTI values (our
measure of lip asymmetry), we found a significant Group
effect [F(1, 11) = 12.52, p < .01]. All RCL participants
showed values above 1 (indicating greater variability in
upper-lip movement cycles) compared to the control participants (including #10), who were either on target (ratio = 1) or slightly below. This measure also revealed a
significant Task effect [F(1, 11) = 3.70, p < .05]. Post hoc
tests showed a significant difference between the [api]
and "lips" task, where the latter on average showed less
symmetrical patterns than the former (Table 1). None
of the other comparisons were found to be significant.

Interlip Coupling
Mean relative phase values did not differ between
the two groups [F(1, 11) = 0.00, p = n.s.]. Both groups
showed on average relative phase values close to 180
(control participants' mean = 175.12, SD = 5.55; RCL
participants' mean = 175.21, SD = 13.93), indicating a
near-symmetrical pattern of lip closure with upper and
lower lip moving in opposite directions. For the (withintrial) standard deviation of relative phase, we found a
significant Group effect [F(1, 11) = 10.27, p < .01]. As
shown in Figure 4C, all RCL speakers (with the exception of #7) showed higher standard deviations in relative phase than did the control speakers. The graph suggests that the values for the younger RCL participants
(15 years) seem higher compared to the values for the
older RCL speakers (16 years). This was confirmed in
a one-tailed t test [t(7) = 2.38, p < .05; RCL  15, mean =
31.08, SD = 5.48; RCL  16, mean = 23.49, SD = 3.58].
There was also a significant Task effect [F(3, 32) = 7.54,
p < .001]. Post hoc tests showed a significant difference
(p < .05) between the "bobby" task and the other tasks,
with the former showing higher values (Table 1). None
of the other comparisons were found to be significant.

Discussion
With respect to our four hypotheses, we can summarize our data as follows:
1.

People with a repaired cleft lip history will show
smaller upper-lip movement amplitudes and peak
velocities in comparison to age-matched control
speakers.

In general, this was confirmed in showing a trend
for smaller upper-lip amplitudes and a significant Group
effect for peak velocities. In fact, these two measures
are highly correlated across speakers of both groups
(Pearson's r = .97, df = 13, p < .001), which is in agreement with other studies (e.g., Munhall et al., 1985).
2.

People with a repaired cleft lip history will show
larger lower-lip movements and higher peak velocities in comparison to age-matched control speakers
to compensate for the restricted movement range of
their upper lip

This hypothesis was not confirmed in our data.
Group effects for both measures were not significant. If
there were a compensation effect, one would expect a
strong negative correlation between upper-lip and lowerlip amplitudes for the RCL group, which was not the
case (Pearson's r = -.015, df = 9, p < n.s.).
3.

14

People with a repaired cleft lip history will show
more variable upper-lip movement patterns in
comparison to control speakers as assessed by the

cSTI. Such a group difference will not exist for the
lower lip.
This hypothesis was confirmed in both aspects. We
found a significant Group effect for the upper-lip cSTI
values, but not for the lower-lip values. As shown in the
ratio between upper- and lower-lip cSTI values, all members of the RCL group showed more variable upper-lip
cyclic patterns in comparison to the lower-lip patterns,
unlike the control speakers.
4.

People with a repaired cleft lip history will show
more variable lip-coupling patterns as expressed in
the standard deviation of continuous estimates of
relative phase in comparison to control speakers.

This hypothesis was confirmed in showing a clear
and (with one exception) consistent difference in relative phase variability between control speakers and
speakers with a repaired cleft upper lip (Figure 4C).
Their overall lip coupling was very similar in terms of
the preferred attractor state. However, for that given
solution, the RCL speakers showed a more variable type
of coupling.
In the remainder of this discussion, we will highlight our most important findings and provide some tentative explanations of the way they might fit a coordination dynamics point of view. We recognize that our
findings may be somewhat biased by the fact that our
two groups were not fully matched in terms of number
of participants and gender. Due to practical circumstances, this was unavoidable at the time, but we acknowledge the limitations this puts on the interpretability of our findings.
The findings of this study support earlier claims that
speakers with a repaired unilateral cleft upper lip may
have limitations in upper-lip mobility (Bardach, 1990;
Susami et al., 1993). Our speakers with a repaired cleft
lip showed, on average, smaller amplitudes and especially lower peak velocities in upper-lip movements.
However, the expected compensation in lower-lip movements was not confirmed, suggesting that the upper-lip
limitation may not necessarily require a larger lowerlip response for these participants (cf. Barlow & Netsell,
1986). In addition, the RCL speakers showed significantly larger spatiotemporal variability in upper-lip
movement cycles. Obviously, the question that comes to
mind is whether the reduced upper-lip motions and the
higher cSTI values are somehow related. That is, do participants who show smaller upper-lip amplitudes also
show higher cSTI values for the upper lip? A proper test
of this type of relationship would entail a within-subject comparison using a systematic variation in movement amplitude across variations in rate (cf. Peper &
Beek, 1998b). For practical reasons, this was not possible
in our study, but we can approach it in a more indirect
way. To this end, we rank ordered all our participants

separately for upper-lip amplitude and cSTI values and
plotted each participant's data in a two-coordinate
space using their ranking scores for upper-lip amplitude and upper-lip cSTI (Figure 5). Two participants
were clear exceptions (#2 and #12), but the ranking
scores for the other participants showed a strong positive linear regression (R2 = .64, Pearson's r = .80), indicating that a participant with a smaller ranking score
on upper-lip amplitude showed a higher-ranking score
on upper-lip cSTI.
How then can smaller amplitudes affect movement
control? To provide a tentative answer to this question,
we turn to a paper by Peper and Beek (1998b). Based on
the Haken-Peper-Beek-Daffertshofer (HPBD) model for
frequency-induced transitions in multifrequency coordination (Haken, Peper, Beek, & Daffertshofer, 1996),
one of the claims they made is that "the specific coupling coefficients are differentially related to the amplitudes of the movements. This amplitude dependence of
the stability of specific coordination patterns may reflect the strength of entraining influences of kinesthetic

afferences" (p. 88). The feasibility of such a claim was
also demonstrated in a robot arm model based on coupled
oscillators (Williamson, 1998), where entrainment of
feedback from movements generated by an oscillator
system enables a stable performance. This feedback is
not about error correction, but it provides a physiological mechanism to couple the dynamics of an effector
with the intrinsic properties of an oscillator system. The
robot model (Williamson, 1998) also showed that the
coupling between two structures (in their case, two robot arms), each connected to an independent joint oscillator system, is critically dependent on the stability
of each of these systems. That is, if one of the coupled
structures is unstable, the overall coupling between two
structures is affected, too. This seems in agreement with
our finding of significantly higher variability in relative phase for our repaired unilateral cleft upper lip
participants. The correlation between both variables
(cSTI upper lip and standard deviation relative phase)
is significant (Pearson's r = .76, df = 9, p < .05). Perhaps this suggests that RCL speakers are limited in

Figure 5. Individual participants plotted in a two-coordinate space using their ranking scores for upper-lip amplitude and upper-lip cSTI.
Linear regression line and corresponding values (equation, R2) are shown as well (see text for more details).

their capacity to entrain movement feedback. In this
light, it is important to note that in a review of unilateral cleft lip repair techniques and effects, Schendel
(2000) pointed out that "following primary lip surgery
increased scar has been found in the lip, but, more importantly, a pattern of denervation/reinervation of the
muscles is seen" (p. 337). He also mentioned possible
changes in muscle diameter and muscle fiber type. The
earlier reported findings of differences in muscle upper-lip activity as found for repaired cleft upper lip participants (Genaro et al., 1994; Ravera et al., 2000) would
tie in with this assumption. It seems, although speculative, a reasonable assumption that such changes (to
some extent) may have occurred in our RCL participants and that this may bear upon our findings of reduced upper-lip movement amplitudes/peak velocities
and co-occurring increases in the variability of upperlip cyclic patterns and interlip coupling. Obviously, we
need more data gathered from studies using a more refined experimental paradigm than we were able to
present here, given our participant population and recording techniques, to substantiate these claims. In the
final part of this discussion, we will briefly address our
two minor findings as they relate to the age and linguistic effects in interlip-coupling stability.
Our younger repaired cleft upper lip participants
demonstrate a greater variability in interlip coupling
than do their older counterparts. The reason for this
effect is unclear, but we think it might relate to changes
in craniofacial structures as part of their pubertal growth
spurt (Drahoradova, Mullerova, & Smahel, 1997; Mitani,
1977; Smahel & Mullerova, 1995). There is, for example,
some indication that speech performance in general
could be slightly worse at the onset of puberty for certain individuals with a cleft palate history (Karnell &
Van Demark, 1986). How this might happen is unknown,
but it seems likely that changes in the morphology of
facial bony structures and muscles during puberty might
destabilize existing solutions in interlip coupling as established before puberty. Once these changes have stabilized, lip coupling might become less variable, as suggested by the data from the older RCL participants.
Obviously, without data on children with a repaired cleft
upper lip before the age of 11, this remains highly speculative and in need of further study, preferably with a
longitudinal perspective.
A final issue arising from our data concerns the significantly higher variability in upper- and lower-lip
movement cycles and interlip coupling for the sentence
task, in comparison to the other tasks, found for both
groups. Other studies have shown that the linguistic
complexity of an utterance may have an effect on motor
task execution (Kleinow & Smith, 2000; van Lieshout
et al., 1999; van Lieshout, Starkweather, Hulstijn, &

16

Peters, 1995). The reason for this is unknown. It is interesting, however, that for the lower-lip amplitudes we
found a significant Task effect, with smaller values for
the sentence task compared to the [api] task. In line
with our previous statements, it might suggest that one
potential reason for seeing more variability for this type
of task is a reduction in movement amplitude, in particular for the lower lip, which is considered more crucial than the upper lip for the control of lip closure
(Barlow & Netsell, 1986). In contrast to relatively simple
tasks, like repeating [api] or [ipa], word-initial lip-closing gestures, as in our "bobby" sentence, require more
flexibility to adapt to variations in phonetic context. In
making smaller lower-lip movements, participants tap
into a potential mechanism to increase variability in lip
coupling and thus allow for more flexibility in movement
control. This is what Kelso and colleagues, based on
earlier work by the German physiologist von Holst, have
dubbed the principle of "relative coordination" (Fuchs
et al., 1996; Kelso, 1995)--relative coordination meaning that although components that are coupled are attracted to each other, they also compete in terms of individual characteristics. Therefore, the coordination
patterns between these components do not show a rigid
entrainment, but rather a flexible solution (Kelso, 1995).
Only if differences or demands become rather extreme
can we assume that even attraction may no longer be
sufficient to maintain the same type of coupling.

Conclusions
The present study is a first attempt to address potential influences on the stability of speech movement
control and coordination in speakers with a repaired cleft
upper lip from a coordination dynamics point of view
(Kelso, 1995). The data from the present study show that
early surgical treatment of a unilateral cleft upper lip
can have significant long-lasting (subclinical) effects on
upper-lip kinematics and interlip coupling. Speakers
with a repaired cleft upper lip may face challenges in
their ability to generate relatively stable movement patterns, which we suggest is related to a reduced movement range/speed for the upper lip. The fact that bilabials are not affected in a perceptually salient way suggests
that the speech production system has a relatively high
tolerance for dealing with movement variability, at least
for this type of sound production. In complex tasks, variability may even become a potential mechanism to allow for a more flexible type of motor control. Even though
the upper lip seem to contribute less to lip closure in
our RCL speakers in comparison to the control participants, we did not find clear evidence for lower-lip compensation strategies as suggested by others (Barlow &
Netsell, 1986). Perhaps the effects need to be stronger

in order to find such adaptations. Finally, we think that
the coordinative dynamics approach holds great promise
as a framework to study (de)stabilizing influences in normal and disordered speech production (Kelso et al., 1986;
Porter & Hogue, 1998; van Lieshout & Moussa, 2000).
