Abstract Two indices of bilingualism, crossover memories and codeswitching (CS), were
explored in five groups of immigrant (English-Hebrew, Georgian-Hebrew Russian-Hebrew)
and indigenous bilinguals (Arabic-Hebrew, Hebrew-English). Participants recalled memories in response to cue words and then were asked to report the language of retrieval and provide a more elaborate narrative. More memories were `same language' memories, recalled in
the language of the experimental session/cue word, but as many as 48 % of the memories were
crossovers, i.e. memories reported in a language other than the language of the session/cue
word. In an effort to examine the ecological validity of the self-reported language of the
memories, the frequency of CS in the elaborated narratives was investigated. For the entire
sample, more CS was found for self-reported crossover memories in L2 sessions. In a further analysis of CS in crossover memories, collapsed across L1 and L2 sessions, significant
differences emerged between immigrants and indigenous bilinguals. Differences between
immigrant and non-immigrant bilinguals are discussed in terms of the role of activation in
crossover memories.

From the former tradition, the focus is on crossover memories, those self-reported memories retrieved in a language other than the language of the experimental session or cue word
(Schrauf and Rubin 1998, 2000; Altman et al. 2012). From psycholinguistics, codeswitching
(CS) is defined here as language behavior where a speaker uses two languages in a single
utterance for a variety of purposes, including fluency, emphasis, focus, contrast (e.g. Clyne
2003; Myers-Scotton 2005; Walters 2005; Zentella 1997). More specifically, we examine the
frequency of CS in narratives as entry point to bilingual autobiographical memory, typically
investigated by self-reported data.
The paper is motivated by three questions: (1) To what extent do bilinguals report more
memories in the same language as cue words (same language memories) and to what extent
do they `cross over' and report memories in their other language (crossover memories)? (2)
Do crossover memories lead to more instances of CS than same language memories when
asked to produce elaborated narratives? (3) To what extent do different immigrant groups
and indigenous minorities differ in reporting crossover memories and use of CS?
Crossover Memories
The most widely used methodology to investigate long term, episodic memory in bilinguals
is a cue word technique based on Galton's (1879) self study procedure for eliciting autobiographical memories (Altman et al. 2012; Bugelski 1977; Marian and Neisser 2000; Schrauf
and Rubin 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004). Bugelski (1977), for example, asked 22 Spanish-English
bilingual adults (mean age 55) to report their first thoughts in response to 20 cue words. The
procedure was initially conducted in L1 (Spanish) and a month later in L2 (English). Results
showed that memories recalled in response to English cue words were associated with later
time periods than memories recalled in Spanish.
In another study examining this issue, Otoya (1987) studied 40 Spanish-English bilingual
students (ages 18-26), half of whom were born in the US or immigrated before the age
of seven and half of the participants were bicultural (immigrated between the ages of 7-
18). Participants were asked to recall three memories up to the age of eight and another
two memories from the age of 14. Following recall of the five memories, they were asked to
retrieve memories for 10 cue words in L1 and in L2 (six of which were translation equivalents).
Results demonstrated that bicultural participants recalled later memories than the others
and Otoya (1987) concluded that cognitive consequences of immigration may explain the
differences.
Using a similar methodology, Marian and Neisser (1997) presented 16 Russian-English
translation equivalents of cue words to 20 Russian-English bilinguals (mean age 21.8). Participants were asked to recall memories related to the cue words and provide the date of the
memories. Findings showed that memories cued in Russian were dated earlier than memories cued in English. This study also demonstrated that the language at the time of an event
matched the language of retrieval. In a further study, Marian and Neisser (2000) presented
24 Russian-English students (mean age 20.2) with 16 cue words, half in Russian and half in
English, which were translation equivalents. Participants were asked to recall autobiographical memories for the cues and then asked to provide the date of the memories. Participants
were asked not to codeswitch and to reply only in the language suitable for that part of the
experiment, since the goal was to arrive at language specific recall. Results showed that the
cues in a given language tended to trigger the recall of events that had taken place in that
language. It was reported that in both experiments there were crossover memories, in the
first experiment 36 % in L1 (Russian) sessions and 16 % in L2 (English) sessions Likewise,
Matsumoto and Stanny (2006) found that Japanese-English bilinguals found more same-

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2015) 44:187-200

189

language memories, recalling more L1 (Japanese) memories when presented an L1 cue and
more L2 (English) encoded memories when triggered with an L2 cue. Percent of crossover
memories--over 35 % for both English and Japanese cues--was estimated from the overall
means reported in the study.
Schrauf and Rubin (1998) investigated autobiographical memories of Spanish-English
adult bilinguals (ages 61-69) who immigrated to the US at (ages 20-35). The authors'
main goal was to examine the influence of a major cultural and linguistic transition, such
as immigration, on the retrieval of memory. Using the cueing procedure, they predicted that
the recall of memories would be affected by the language of the cue word, as in Marian
and Neisser (1997). In other words, cue words in the mother tongue would trigger earlier
memories, and cue words in the second language would be associated with memories from
the period after immigration. Schrauf and Rubin (1998) results did not show cue word effects
with mature adults, in contrast to Marian and Neisser (2000) findings with university students.
Furthermore, Schrauf and Rubin (1998, 2000, 2004) were interested in memories which were
cued in one language but recalled in the other language the bilingual uses, i.e. what are termed
crossover memories. Their results (20% crossovers in their 1998 study and 25% in their 2000
study) showed that more Spanish crossover memories were dated prior to immigration, and
more English crossover memories were recalled after immigration. Schrauf and Rubin (2004)
also showed that that the majority of L1 (Spanish) memories were related to events before
immigration where only Spanish was spoken, while L2 (English) memories were associated
with events after immigration.
Larsen et al. (2002) also used the cueing methodology when examining bilingual memory
among Polish immigrants in Denmark. Their study recruited two groups of bilingual adults
(over the age of 50) who were either 24 or 34 years of age at the time of immigration. The
two age groups recalled more personal memories in L1 (Polish) prior to their immigration
period and more memories in L2 (Danish) following their immigration period.
The meaningful number of crossover memories found in the literature (25 % in Schrauf
and Rubin (1998); 16-67 % in Marian and Neisser 2000; 40 % in Altman et al. (2012))
is claimed to be the entry point most indicative that memory is language-dependent. In an
effort to provide behavioral support for reported recall in autobiographical narrative memory,
bilingual CS is introduced here as a measure of the relationship between bilingualism and
memory.
Codeswitching
Codeswitching (CS) research has followed several relatively independent tracks. Poplack's
(1980) bound and equivalence morpheme constraints, mathematical models of bilingual
discourse (Sankoff 2002), and generative approaches to CS (e.g. MacSwan 1999, 2005;
Myers-Scotton 2005) all emphasize possible representations of syntactic constituents related
to the two grammars. Psycholinguistic research has looked at the temporal `cost' of CS
(Kroll and Groot 1997; Studnitz and Green 2002), language selection and cross-language
activation (Colome 2001; Schwartz and Kroll 2006; Kroll et al. 2008), primarily for lexical
processing. Sentence level research has been more limited (e.g. Heredia and Altarriba 2002).
Discourse approaches have addressed structural as well as processing issues (Auer 1998;
Matras 2000). Functional approaches to CS have focused on social motivations which underlie
the phenomenon. Among the most noticeable functions are switching to indicate shifts in
topic, setting and listener (e.g. Zentella 1997; Gardner-Chloros et al. 2000).
In a model informed by the literature cited here and by a wider interest in motivations
for code mixing (Heredia and Altarriba 2001), Walters (2005) proposed a bilingual process-

123

190

J Psycholinguist Res (2015) 44:187-200

ing model of sociopragmatic and psycholinguistic information, attempting to merge structural and functional approaches to CS. The model distinguishes between sociopragmatic and
structural psycholinguistic CS and assumes that sociopragmatic CS addresses how bilinguals
interact with the real world while psycholinguistic CS deals with individual motivations for
switching from one language to another.
In a few of the studies of autobiographical recall which also reported data on CS, Marian and Kaushanskaya (2004) asked Russian-English bilingual college students to describe
personal events. They found main effects for the language of retrieval and the language of
encoding (`ambience language') and an interaction between retrieval language and ambience
language, i.e. when the ambience language did not match the retrieval language, with more
CS to English when retrieving in Russian than when retrieving in English. Moreover, the
authors did not find a relationship between frequency of CS and language proficiency. In
a later study, Marian and Kaushanskaya (2007) asked Russian-English bilinguals to generate 16 memories as described above. They found that when speaking L1, there were more
borrowings from L2 than in the opposite direction. In addition, they found more transfers
(interference) when speaking L2 than when speaking in L1.
Studies involving conversational speech data show that CS frequency ranges from 5-25 %
and involves mainly nouns and noun phrases (Iluz-Cohen and Walters 2012; Paradis and
Nicoladis 2007; Stephens 1986; Zentella 1997).
In summary, crossover memories, those memories reported to be retrieved in a language
different from the experimental session/cue word are unique to bilinguals; they represent the
individual's reported language use or metalinguistic judgment. CS, also unique to bilinguals
is language behavior which via elaborated narratives may shed further light on bilingual
processes of autobiographical narrative memory.
Predictions
In accordance with previous research on crossover memories (Schrauf and Rubin 1998,
2000), it is predicted that overall there will be more same language memories than crossover
memories in L1. It is also hypothesized that there will be more crossover memories for
L2 sessions than for L1 sessions. The assumption underlying this prediction is related to
language activation and memory retrieval. In L1 sessions, a bilingual speaker's first language
is activated by the instructions, by the interaction with the experimenter and by the cue words,
limiting access to L2. In addition, language dominance/proficiency, age, and relative use of
the two languages may also influence the language of retrieval (Heredia and Brown 2006).
Conversely, L2 sessions involve increased activation in comparison to L1 sessions, and are
thus predicted to generate more crossover memories.
In terms of CS, two hypotheses are proposed: (a) more CS for L2 than L1 sessions and (b)
more CS for crossover memories (those reported to be in a language other than the language
of the session) than for same language memories. In L2 sessions, processing is expected to
be more effortful and lead to more CS in order to maintain fluency and/or compensate for
difficulties in lexical access. In contrast, higher proficiency and stronger preference for L1
will contribute to greater recall in the native language. Less CS is predicted in L1 sessions,
where the lexicon is more accessible. With regard to CS and crossover memories, it is assumed
that crossover memories involve greater activation of both languages and will thus lead to
higher levels of CS, especially in L2 sessions. Frequency of CS is predicted to be higher
for crossover memories. This prediction is based on the assumption that crossover memories
involve a linguistic transition between the language of the event (session/cue word) and the
self-reported language of recall. This mental transition is expected to be paralleled by a

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2015) 44:187-200

191

behavioral switch expressed as CS in the narratives describing the event. In other words, a
behavioral switch in the form of CS is expected to accompany a switch reported as a crossover
memory.

Methods
The hypotheses outlined above require combining two methods: the memory cueing paradigm from the psychology of autobiographical narrative memory and analysis of CS from
the sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics of bilingualism. Memory cueing was employed to
investigate self-reported language-of-retrieval to get at crossover and same language memories, and narratives were elicited to examine the frequency of CS in L1 and L2 and for
crossover versus same language memories.
Participants
Fifty-five mature bilingual adults (ages 54-85) took part in the study, divided into immigrant
and non-immigrant groups and then sub-divided into five language groups as seen in Table
1. All immigrant participants (N = 33) arrived in Israel from the US or UK, the former
Soviet Union or Soviet Georgia and immigrated during adulthood (after age 21). The nonimmigrant group (N = 22) included two sub-groups who were born in Israel and lived there
most of their lives. There were seven Hebrew-English speakers who had exposure to English
(L2) from short visits or sabbatical stays in the US or UK, and 15 Arabic-Hebrew speakers
who grew up in Arabic speaking towns and villages in Israel. All participants agreed to
participate voluntarily and provided written informed consent. Participants were all exposed
exclusively or predominately to their respective L1 from infancy through early adulthood.
Hebrew was a second language learned after childhood for all participants except native
Hebrew speakers. The criterion for participation was ability to sustain a conversation in each
one of the languages for at least an hour. Four potential participants who did not meet this
criterion were excluded. As a further measure of bilingualism, the audio transcripts in the
second language were rated by two Hebrew native speakers and all participants were rated
seven on a 10-point rating scale for vocabulary and fluency as seen in Table 1.

Procedure and Materials
Two sessions were conducted, one in each language. Stimulus words came from Rubin
(1980) and the cue word technique from Schrauf and Rubin (1998). The first session was
conducted in L2 and the second session was conducted in L1. Different cues were used
for each session. The same bilingual experimenter conducted each session with 1-2 weeks
intervening. The participants were made aware that the interviewer was bilingual prior to data
collection. Following the second session, each participant completed a language background
questionnaire. Sessions lasted on average 90 min. They were recorded on a Sony ICD-SX25
V-O-R and transferred electronically for transcription.
The first session involved looking successively at each of 16 cue words and briefly reporting
a concrete and specific memory for each word (Schrauf and Rubin 1998, 2000). To make sure
instructions were understood, each participant was given an example of a concrete memory.
After the participant's response, s/he was asked to indicate the language of the memory.
When an English-Hebrew participant took part in the study, for example, s/he was asked:
"This memory came to me in:"
No language English Hebrew Both Languages
This metalinguistic judgment enabled classification of memories as same language or
crossovers depending on whether the language of the experimental session/cue word was
the same or different from the reported language. All memories reported as `English' were
considered `same language memories,' and all memories recalled in `Hebrew' or `Both
languages' were considered crossover memories. The participant reported the language of
recall following retrieval of the memory, sequentially for each of the 16 stimulus cues.
There was a total of 1,499 specific, concrete memories, 768 in L1 sessions and 731 in L2
sessions.
After the cue word procedure, the interviewer chose one memory from each of the participant's decades across the lifespan and asked the participant to provide a longer narrative involving more details about the event. A similar number of crossover and same language memories were elicited from the participant when possible. Participants were asked
to describe "anything else remembered about the specific memory".
Data Analyses
The following comparisons were examined:
(1) Frequency of `same language' and `crossover' memories in L1 and L2 sessions. The language in which the memory was recalled was coded as either `same language' (retrieved
in the same language as the cue/session) or `crossover' (retrieved in the other language
or in both languages).
(2) Codeswitches were counted as a percent of total words uttered in that language following Iluz-Cohen and Walters (2012) and Paradis and Nicoladis (2007). Instances of CS
were counted when a participant switched from the language of the session to the other
language. CS instances were then divided by the total number of words the participant
produced in describing his/her memories. For example, in the sentence `I went to the
makolet [grocery store] yesterday, there is 16.66 % CS (one codeswitched instance out
of six words). Frequencies of CS for same language and crossover memories in L1 and
L2 sessions were calculated.

Results
The findings are reported as follows: First, frequencies of memory recall are presented,
comparing crossover and same language memories in L1 and L2 sessions. Then, the frequency
of CS is reported for the two categories of memories in L1 and L2 sessions and in crossover
and same language memories. The results are reported for (a) the overall sample (N = 55)
(b) immigrants (N = 33) versus indigenous bilinguals (N = 22) and (c) for each of the
five language groups: English-Hebrew (N = 12), Georgian-Hebrew (N = 8), Russian-
Hebrew (N = 13), Hebrew-English (N = 7) and Arabic-Hebrew (N = 15). Data from the
crossovers of the seven Hebrew-English participants were reported briefly in Altman et al.
(2012) and data for the English-Hebrew bilinguals were reported in Altman et al. (2012).
Crossover Memories Versus Same Language Memories in L1 and L2
For the entire sample of bilinguals, 52 % of the memories were reported to be recalled in the
same language as the session/cue word and 48 % were reported to be crossovers memories,
i.e. in a language other than the language of the session. A non-parametric Friedman ANOVA
conducted on the frequency of (1) same language memories in L1 sessions, (2) same language
memories in L2 sessions, (3) crossover memories in L1 sessions, and (4) crossovers in L2
sessions yielded significant differences between conditions ( 2 = 75.9, p < .001). Mean
frequencies and standard deviations of memories are presented in Table 2.
The data show that there were almost three times as many same language memories in L1
sessions as there were in L2 sessions and almost three times as many crossover memories in
L2 sessions as there were in L1 sessions. A Wilcoxon Matched Pairs tests confirmed both the
hypothesis that there would be more same language memories (M = 10.56) than crossover
memories (M = 3.40) in L1 sessions, Z = -4.35 ( p < .001) and the hypothesis that there
would be more crossover memories (M = 9.56) than same language memories (M = 3.73)
in L2, Z = -4.29 ( p < .001).
Immigration Effects

both groups, viz. more same language memories in L1 sessions and more crossover memories
in L2 sessions.
A non-parametric Friedman ANOVA conducted on the frequency of (1) same language
memories in L1 sessions, (2) same language memories in L2 sessions, (3) crossover memories in L1 sessions, and (4) crossovers in L2 yielded significant differences between
the four conditions for immigrants ( 2 = 34.65, p < .001) and indigenous bilinguals
( 2 = 51.25, p < .001). Wilcoxon Matched Pairs were conducted for each of the four conditions. These tests showed significant differences between immigrant and non-immigrant
bilinguals for both same language memories in L1 (Z = -3.08, p < .01) and crossovers in
L1 (Z = -2.45, p < .05). When comparing immigrants and indigenous bilinguals in L2,
the results were not significant for either same language memories (Z = -1.72, p > .05)
or crossovers (Z = -1.74, p > .05).
The findings indicate that immigration makes a difference in bilinguals' retrieval of same
language and crossover memories in L1 but not in L2. Immigrants reported more memories
in L2 and fewer memories in L1. In L2 sessions, however, when instructions and cues are
presented in L2, both immigrants and indigenous bilinguals recall most of their memories in
L1.

Differences for Language Groups
Somewhat different patterns emerged following a breakdown of the experimental conditions
by native language. Four of the five language groups showed the same pattern: i.e. more
same language memories in L1 sessions and more crossover memories in L2 sessions. On the
other hand, Georgian-Hebrew bilinguals reported more crossover memories in both L1 and
L2 sessions. Statistical analyses were not appropriate due to the small number of participants
in each group.
Of greatest interest for the study of bilingual memory are the frequencies of crossover
memories in the L2 conditions, taken here as an indicator of how language and memory are
interrelated (e.g. Schrauf and Rubin 1998, 2000). Two issues are germane to this finding, one
related to proficiency and bilingual experience and the other to the nature of bilingualism.
Following Heredia and Brown (2006), higher proficiency in L1 than L2 was predicted to yield
more same language memories overall and more crossover memories in L2 sessions. These
predictions were obtained here for four out of the five immigrant groups. But, mere frequency
of memories, even when compared across the four conditions in this study, is only an indirect
way to get at the nature of bilingualism. In the following section, a more behavioral measure
of bilingualism, i.e. CS, is used to gain insight into bilingual memory.
Codeswitching for Crossover and Same Language Memories in L1 and L2 sessions
A total of 920 narratives were elicited and transcribed, 478 in L1 and 442 in L2. There were
2,895 instances of CS produced by the 55 bilingual participants. CS across individuals ranged
from 0-24 instances per memory. The frequencies of CS are summarized in Table 4.
A univariate analysis of variance conducted for all 55 participants yielded significant
differences among the four CS conditions: same language memories in L1, same language
memories in L2, crossover memories in L1, crossover memories in L2,.F(3, 52) = 3.34, p <
.05. A posthoc Bonferroni revealed that the significant differences stemmed from the higher
frequency of CS in crossover memories in L2 (13 per 1,000 words) in comparison to the
frequency in same language memories in L2 (7 per 1,000 words).

Immigration Effects
In comparing CS frequency for immigrant versus non-immigrant groups in the crossover
versus same language memory conditions and the L1 versus the L2 conditions, an ANOVA
showed significant differences once more among the four conditions F (3, 51) = 2.86, p <
.05. A posthoc Bonferroni revealed a trend toward significance in the immigrants' data
( p = 0.079) in crossover versus same language memories in L2 (14 vs. 7 switches per
1,000 words, respectively). No significant main effects or interactions were found for the
non-immigrant group.
Differences for Language Groups
In order to clarify the role of each language group, a oneway ANOVA was conducted for
the four CS conditions--same language memories in L1, same language memories in L2,
crossover memories in L1, crossover memories in L2--for each group. The Georgian-Hebrew
participants' results were found to be significantly different from three out of the four language groups (Russian-Hebrew, Hebrew-English and Arabic-Hebrew) for the four conditions, F (3, 48) = 2.06, p < .05. A posthoc Bonferroni test showed a significantly higher
frequency of CS in crossover memories than same language memories in L2 (18 vs. 11
codeswitches per thousand words, respectively) for the Georgian-Hebrew participants.
Finally, it was hypothesized that there would be more CS in crossover memories than in
same language memories and more CS instances in L2 than in L1 sessions. A t test conducted
on the entire sample confirmed that CS instances were more numerous in crossover memories
than in same language memories t (54) = 2.67, p < .05 as seen in Table 5. No significant
results were found relating to the difference in CS in L1 and L2.
When comparing immigrants and indigenous bilinguals in terms of frequency of CS in
crossover and same language memories, significant differences were found for the immigrant
group t (31) = 3.27, p < .01 but not for the non-immigrant group alone ( p > .05). No
significant results were found relating to the difference in CS in L1 and in L2 in either the
immigrant or non-immigrant groups.

Discussion
The present study examined bilingualism and autobiographical narrative by means of selfreported crossover memories and bilingual CS behavior. Crossover memories were found to
be more frequent in L2 sessions, and same language memories were more frequent in L1
sessions, as predicted. These results were found for immigrant and indigenous bilinguals
alike. In a more detailed examination of the different language groups in the study, four out
of the five groups followed this same pattern. This finding replicates much of the work on
bilingual autobiographical memory showing a high rate of crossover memories in bilinguals'
narrative recall (e.g., Schrauf and Rubin 1998). As a further entry point into the bilingualism
of immigrants and indigenous minorities, the frequency of CS was examined for same language and crossover memories in L1 and L2 sessions. Results showed more CS in crossover
memories in L2 than in any other condition. Finally, it was also found that in general there
was more CS in crossover memories than in same language memories. This finding was
was most salient for the immigrant group. No significant results were found relating to the
difference in CS in L1 and in L2 sessions. This indicates that immigration makes a difference
in bilinguals' frequency of CS in crossover versus same language memories, but does not
make a difference when comparing the frequency of CS in L1 and L2.
Crossover Memories as Insight to Bilingual Memory
The initial question corroborated a well-established finding that autobiographical memory is
encoded for language (Francis 1999 i.e. `language dependent' memory (Marian and Neisser
2000; Schrauf and Durazo-Arvizu 2006) This finding becomes clearer in light of the fact that
memory for recall of the language of a conversation which took place only minutes before
pales in comparison to memory for content (Berkowits 1984; Horiba 1996).
One possible resolution of this apparent contradiction is that the studies cited here focus on
short term, working memory, and studies of autobiographical narratives deal with long term,
episodic memory. But this distinction cannot account for how a bilingual fails to recall accu-

rately the language of a prior conversation immediately after it occurs, but up to 50 years later
can and does distinguish between same language and crossover memories. The meaningful
number of crossovers (25 % in Schrauf and Rubin 1998; 16-67 % in Marian and Neisser
(2000); and 48 % in the present study) seems to indicate that some aspects of language may
be recoverable from an original event, or at least from the reconstructed portions of that event.
As discussed in Altman et al. (2012), when asked to retrieve the language of the memory,
there is an attempt to detect the language of the experience. The language of experience may
be accessed via sociolinguistic information about the setting, topic and people involved in the
memory. In this way, self-reported recall of the language of a memory may involve a complex
integral of information. It is also a unitary, `reproductive' measure. It is the combination of
complex, integrated judgments and reconstructed aspects of memory which may account for
the crossover memories documented here, especially in the L2 sessions.
From a more bilingual perspective, the crossovers in this study are evidence for activation
of both languages. Despite the fact that the participant is instructed and cued in one language,
s/he reports memories from the other language, evidence that traces of language cues remain
in long term memory. In a study of lexical activation to examine "whether the presence of sentence context would modulate cross-language, non-selective activation," Schwartz and Kroll
(2006) concluded that "cross-language alternatives" are active at all stages of processing. In
making this argument elsewhere, Kroll et al. (2008) distinguish L1 from L2 processing. L1
is claimed to be more proficient and `faster' and thus less susceptible to L2 influence than
the influence of L1 on L2. L2 is argued to involve more cross-language interaction, the state
which leads to crossover memories in the present study. The data here suggest that in both
L1 and L2 there is activation of the other language, as demonstrated by the prevalence of
CS in all language groups even though the participants were not expected or encouraged to
codeswitch. Nevertheless, the low frequencies of CS may also point to the possibility that
the participants, like most bilinguals, are operating in `bilingual mode' (Grosjean 2001).
Codeswitching
The higher frequency of CS found in crossover memories in this study lends support to
the hypothesis that these two different measures of bilingualism are related. CS is a behavioral measure, which validates participants' self-reported recall. Beyond this methodological
point, the interest here is in why these two measures are related and more specifically, why
crossover memories generate more CS. I propose that at the moment a participant retrieves
a memory and reports it as a crossover, the `other' language is activated along with the
language of the session/cue word. When s/he is later asked to elaborate on this memory in
an extended narrative, the `other' language facilitates, perhaps even triggers, CS into the
activated language. This interpretation conforms to a wide range of findings at the lexical
level of processing, where both languages have been found to be activated (e.g. Francis 1999;
Schwartz and Kroll 2006).
While CS and crossovers are seen as related in terms of activation, they are nevertheless
not totally identical in terms of processing. Crossover memories are conscious, metalinguistic recall judgments, providing insight into retrieval processes of personal events. These
judgments, following Small and Nusbaum (2004), involve a more diffuse set of processes
than CS, which is natural language use in context. CS draws on phonological, grammatical
and pragmatic language processes which are more automatic. Despite this difference, both
crossover memories and CS are nurtured by the fact that both languages are activated. This
activation has cognitive effects on how people talk about their memories. That is, at the

123

198

J Psycholinguist Res (2015) 44:187-200

level of mental representation in memory, a crossover retains language-specific (L1 plus L2)
information that "forces itself" into the narrative reporting of those memories.
Immigrants Versus Indigenous Bilinguals
Immigration was found to make a difference in the recall of same language and crossover
memories in L1 but not in L2. Immigrants reported more memories in L2 and fewer memories
in L1 than indigenous bilinguals when instructed and shown cue words in L1. In L2 sessions,
however, when cues were shown in L2, for both immigrants and indigenous bilinguals, most
memories were reported in L1. The difference between immigrants and indigenous bilinguals
in the L1 sessions may be due to the immigrants' motivation to acculturate, thus making them
more likely to recall memories in L2, the language of their new environment.
In terms of CS, immigrants produced more CS in crossover memories than in same language memories, while indigenous bilinguals used similar amounts of CS in crossovers and
same language memories. For both immigrants and indigenous bilinguals, the difference in
CS in L1 and L2 was not significant. This shows that the crossover-same language distinction
is more sensitive than the L1-L2 distinction to differences between immigrants and indigenous bilinguals. There were no significant differences in the frequency of CS in L1 and L2
for both groups. F.
Language Groups
One issue pertinent to the discussion of bilingual autobiographical memory is cultural/linguistic background (Schrauf and Rubin 1998). Some of the subtle differences in
the results would not have arisen if the analysis would have stopped with overall data or at
the immigrant versus indigenous bilingual level. The importance of relating to the different
language groups' diversity is especially apparent when the data for the Georgian-Hebrew
immigrants are considered. This group reported more crossover memories overall in both
sessions and showed the largest amount of CS. This may be due to the fact that they know
Georgian well, since they immigrated along with their communities from abroad and settled
in closely-knit as well. Their sense of Georgian heritage thus remains both in their memory
retrieval and in their language maintenance to a greater extent than other immigrants in this
study. On the other hand, Hebrew symbolizes the language of the Bible and the state of Israel,
the place to which they immigrated, some after years of longing. These bonds to their native
language and to the language of the new country are sources of a merged identity, which
finds expression in both crossover memories and CS.
In sum, this investigation showed that memory is language-dependent and that bilingualism finds expression in large numbers of crossover memories. CS complements the findings
for crossover memories, with the greatest amount of CS showing up for these particularly
bilingual (crossover) memories. The CS measure was also found to be more sensitive to the
crossover-same language comparison than to the differences in performance in L1 and L2,
especially for immigrant bilinguals. Finally, the Georgian Israelis cultural-linguistic background stood out as distinct among all immigrant and indigenous bilinguals.
