Gay Versus Fag

This research investigates whether derogatory group labels (fag, fairy) elicit different
automatic reactions than do category labels (gay, homosexual). In a study (N = 55),
involving both heterosexual and homosexual participants, the authors investigated the
effects of subliminally represented derogatory versus category labels on the recognition
of positive and negative traits that were stereotypical, counterstereotypical, or irrelevant
to the category gay, is reported. In line with hypotheses, both derogatory and category
labels activated the stereotype. Yet, in heterosexual participants, derogatory labels activated associations that were much less favorable than those activated by category labels.
In contrast, homosexual participants reacted in much the same way to category and
derogatory labels. The results suggest that heterosexuals are particularly likely to be negatively affected by derogatory group labels. The importance of these findings for the
enforcement of political correctness norms is discussed.

erogatory group labels, such as fag, nigger, and kike, are often used to unequivocally portray groups in a disparaging manner. The mere overhearing of these
labels is likely to allow social perceivers to identify the users' (prejudiced) representations of these target groups. Although it is not difficult to infer the attitude that
people hold about a certain group when they address them in a derogatory fashion
or to foresee how others may react toward those who use such social slurs (Castelli,
Arcuri, & Zogmaister, 2003; Simon & Greenberg, 1996), it is still not easy to give
an appropriate picture of people's spontaneous cognitive and affective reactions
when they come across these derogatory group terms (Carnaghi & Maass, in press).
As a matter of fact, social psychologists have consistently addressed how people
who were not the target of such derogatory labels react to derogatory labels referred

to an out-group, whereas little is known about the reaction of those who are the targets of the insult. To date, several studies have investigated how European American
participants reacted, in terms of stereotype application, when confronted with the
derogatory label nigger (Greenberg & Pyszczynsky, 1985; Kirkland, Greenberg, &
Pyszczynsky, 1987; Simon & Greenberg, 1996). Also, few studies have investigated
how heterosexual participants responded, in terms of automatic evaluation or stereotype activation, to the supraliminal or subliminal exposure to derogatory labels concerning homosexuals, such as fag and fairy (Carnaghi & Maass, 2005, in press;
Carnaghi, Maass, Bianchi, Castelli, & Brentel, 2005). However, as of now, no study
has directly compared how people react to derogatory labels when such labels are or
are not referred to their own group. In other words, do people react differently to
derogatory group labels when directed at their own group rather than an out-group?
For instance, do heterosexuals and homosexuals equally react to the label fag, or will
reactions differ according to the perceivers' sexual orientation?
The present study intends to address this neglected issue. Specifically, we test
whether the terms gay and fag may elicit similar or dissimilar automatic stereotyping and/or prejudice responses from heterosexual and homosexual participants. We
will first review the existing literature concerning the effects that derogatory labels
have on people's controlled and automatic processes when they are not personally
part of the target group. We will then outline the aims of our research, focussing on
people who belong (or do not belong) to the disparaged group.

The Effects of Derogatory Labels on Explicit Attitudes
In social psychology, the effects of perceivers' exposure to derogatory group
labels have been studied from different vantage points. Although an impressive
number of studies have tackled the relation between derogatory group labels and the
relative size and status of minority groups (Mullen & Johnson, 1993, 1995; Mullen,
Rozell, & Johnson, 2000, 2001; Palmore, 1962), only few studies have investigated
the way people react to such derogatory labels when used in interpersonal discourse
(Greenberg & Pyszczynsky, 1985; Kirkland et al., 1987; Simon & Greenberg, 1996).
Specifically, these studies have addressed the evaluative consequences of the overhearing of social slurs on perceivers' impression formation or perceivers' stereotype
application (Greenberg & Pyszczynsky, 1985; Kirkland et al., 1987; Simon &
Greenberg, 1996). For instance, Greenberg and Pyszczynsky (1985) conducted a
study in which White American participants observed a debate between a White and
a Black person who either won or lost the debate. Subsequently, participants overheard a comment from a confederate who was allegedly one of the evaluators. The
confederate criticized the Black person either in an ethnically derogatory (i.e.,
"There's no way that nigger won the debate") or in an ethnically neutral manner (i.e.,
"There's no way that pro-debator won the debate"). As predicted, the Black debater
was considered as less skilled when participants overheard the ethnic slur, but only

144

Journal of Language and Social Psychology

when the target person had lost the debate. In contrast, the nonethnic criticism did
not affect the evaluation of the target (for similar results, see Kirkland et al., 1987).
It is worth noticing that, in the just-mentioned study, participants were exposed
either to a derogatory ethnic label (nigger) or to a label that made no reference to
ethnicity (pro-debator). In other words, the derogatory ethnic label was not compared to a neutral, nonderogatory, ethnic label referring to the same category (e.g.,
Black). Therefore, it remains unclear whether the derogatory ethnic label (nigger)
led to negative target evaluations because of its derogatory nature or because of its
reference to a specific ethnic minority group (Blacks).
To disentangle the effects of derogatory racial slurs from those of simple category
activation, Simon and Greenberg (1996) conducted a study in which participants
were exposed to either a derogatory ethnic label (nigger) or to a neutral ethnic label
(Black) or, as a control condition, to no critical remark. Furthermore, participants
were classified with respect to their level of prejudice toward African Americans into
three distinct groups, namely pro-Black, anti-Black, and ambivalent, and they were
asked to evaluate the target of the critical remark on several positive and negative
items. Results showed that participants with pro-Black and those with anti-Black
attitudes evaluated the target no differently in the derogatory than in the neutral ethnic label condition. Apparently, derogative versus neutral language forms had
absolutely no impact on their reactions toward the target person. In contrast, ambivalent participants were affected by language form but in the direction opposite to what
one may expect. These participants evaluated the target in a more flattering way in
the derogatory ethnic label condition than in the remaining conditions (neutral language and control). Thus, regardless of the participant's own attitude toward African
Americans, there was absolutely no evidence that the derogatory ethnic label (nigger) would trigger a less positive evaluation than the nonderogatory ethnic label
(Black). If anything, there was a tendency to evaluate the target of the derogatory
ethnic label more positively, at least for participants with ambivalent attitudes.
Although a quick glance at the just-mentioned experiments allows us to conclude
that derogatory terms and category labels are practically synonymous, a more accurate analysis suggests that this conclusion may be premature considering a number
of methodological limits. The first limit of the above studies is that they have investigated the reactions to derogatory group labels in a public context in which such discriminative speech may have been clearly considered counternormative. It therefore
appears likely that the students participating in these experiments may have distanced themselves from the agent of discrimination and purposefully displayed egalitarian attitudes toward the discriminated target group (Castelli et al., 2003).
Closely related is the second limit, namely, the use of explicit measures that
required participants to report their impression of the target on a number of dimensions. These measures are likely to tap the participants' reasoned responses rather
than their spontaneous (and presumably negative) reactions to derogatory labels.
Measures such as these are known to be sensitive to contextual factors (i.e., norm of

Carnaghi, Maass / Derogatory Group Labels

145

no discrimination) and to allow participants to exert a high degree of intentional control over their responses. Therefore, even if derogatory labels may have initially
elicited a negative representation of the minority group in the participants' minds,
they may have found it relatively easy to compensate or suppress such thoughts
(Simon & Greenberg, 1996).
Third, in the previous studies, the cognitive and evaluative aspects of stereotypes
are not clearly separated. Conceptualizing stereotyping and prejudice as two distinct,
albeit related, components of perceivers' intergroup attitudes (Wittenbrink, Judd, &
Park, 1997, 2001), previous studies on ethnophaulisms did not clearly identify which
component is mainly affected by derogatory labels. As a case in point, participants
in Greenberg and Pyszczynsky's (1985) study and in Kirkland et al.'s (1987) study
were asked to rate the target's argumentative competency in a debate. Because limited verbal skills are not only an undesirable characteristic but also a central part of
the Black stereotype in the United States, it remains unclear whether the dependent
variable mainly concerned the negative affect or the stereotypic representation
elicited by the derogatory term. In a similar vein, participants in the Simon and
Greenberg (1996) study were required to react to derogatory labels on affective (i.e.,
positive and negative traits) but not on cognitive (stereotypicality) measures, leaving
unresolved whether derogatory labels mainly differed from category labels in terms
of prejudice or in terms of stereotyping.

The Effects of Derogatory Labels on Implicit Attitudes
With these limits in mind, Carnaghi and Maass (2005, in press; Carnaghi et al.,
2005) developed a research program aimed to test perceivers' automatic reactions
toward derogatory group labels, employing a wide range of implicit measures.
In a relevant study, Carnaghi and Maass (2005) used an implicit approach-
avoidance task (IAAT; Castelli, Zogmaister, Smith, & Arcuri, 2004; Chen & Bargh,
1999; Duckworth, Bargh, Garcia, & Chaiken, 2002; Vaes, Paladino, Castelli, &
Leyens, 2003; Wentura, Rothermund, & Bak, 2000) to test whether derogatory
group labels versus category labels would elicit different automatic evaluative
responses. Specifically, Carnaghi and Maass (2005) asked participants to judge a
small sample of items as referring to social (e.g., Africans) or nonsocial categories
(e.g., bottles) by pressing an approach key, which was placed closer to the to be classified items, or an avoidance key, which was distant from the to be classified items
(for a similar procedure, see Castelli et al., 2004). Importantly, among the labels
referring to social groups were two category group labels, namely, gay and Southerner,
and two corresponding derogatory group labels, namely, fag and terrone.1 Results
showed that participants, all of whom were heterosexual and came form northern
Italy, were much faster at approaching category group labels than derogatory group
labels, whereas no difference emerged between category and derogatory group labels
in the avoidance movement.

A subsequent experiment attempted to more clearly distinguish the cognitive and
evaluative components of stereotypes (Carnaghi et al., 2005; see also Carnaghi &
Maass, in press). Following the procedure outlined by Wittenbrink and colleagues
(1997, 2001), a semantic priming paradigm was used in which a prime was subliminally presented, followed by a target stimulus requiring a word or nonword decision. Primes comprised two category labels (i.e., gay, homosexual), two derogatory
labels (i.e., fag, fairy), and two nonsense labels (i.e., secadftg, gruiteo). The target
words were orthogonally organized with respect to their relevance to the category in
question (i.e., stereotypical, counterstereotypical, and irrelevant traits) and to their
valence (i.e., positive and negative traits).
Results showed that both category and derogatory labels equally activated those
semantic concepts that are stereotypically associated with gays. That is, regardless
of type of prime (category or derogatory), participants reacted faster to categoryrelated than to category-unrelated target words. Moreover, compared to category
labels, derogatory labels elicited less flattering representations of the target group.
Thus, participants reacted more slowly to positive targets when primed by derogatory labels (e.g., fag) than when primed by category labels (e.g., gay). Together,
these results suggest that derogatory group labels differ from category group labels
mainly with respect to the valence of the associations they elicit. Thus, it is not so
much the ability to activate stereotypical content than the tendency to activate less
flattering associations that distinguishes derogatory from category group labels.
An important limit of both lines of research reported above is that the authors
have only addressed participants' reactions toward derogatory labels when these
labels refer to an out-group of which they are not personally a part. Previous studies
have failed to analyze participants' reactions toward derogatory labels directed at
their own in-group. It therefore remains unclear whether social observers equally
react to derogatory terms regardless of whether their own group or an out-group is
the target of such derogatory labels. To provide first evidence on this question, we
conducted a study in which we compared the reaction of heterosexuals and homosexuals toward category and derogatory labels concerning gays as a group.

Overview of the Study and Hypotheses
Following the procedure outlined by Wittenbrink et al. (1997, 2001), we used a
semantic priming paradigm in which the prime was presented subliminally and followed by a target stimulus requiring a word or nonword decision. Adopting the
material used in the study by Carnaghi et al. (2005), primes comprised two category
labels (i.e., gay, homosexual) and two derogatory labels (i.e., fag, fairy). The target
words included stereotypical traits of gays, counterstereotypical traits, and traits that
are irrelevant to the group in question. Furthermore, half of the target words were
positive, half negative.
As far as the heterosexual participants were concerned, we expected to replicate
previous findings (Carnaghi et al., 2005; Carnaghi & Maass, 2005, in press) indicating

Carnaghi, Maass / Derogatory Group Labels

147

that reactions to category versus derogatory labels mainly differ with respect to
valence. More properly, we expected participants to react faster to positive targets
when primed by category than by derogatory labels and, as a tendency, to respond
slower to negative targets when primed by category rather than by derogatory labels.
Although both results, namely, inhibition on positive and facilitation on negative targets, are theoretically plausible, only the former has been empirically confirmed. As
a matter of fact, Carnaghi and Maass (2005), using an IAAT, found that participants
were faster to approach category labels than derogatory labels, whereas the opposite
pattern for avoidance failed to reach conventional levels of significance. The same
asymmetry was found in studies in which participants reacted to positive and negative targets after having been subliminally primed with category and derogatory
labels (Carnaghi et al., 2005; Carnaghi & Maass, in press). These studies found that
derogatory labels, compared to category labels, prevented the activation of positively
valenced targets but failed to reliably affect participants' reactions to negative targets. Although the reasons for this asymmetric result pattern remain unclear, the
above studies have consistently shown that derogatory, compared to category, labels
tend to inhibit access to positively valenced information rather than to facilitate
access to negative information. On the basis of these findings, we expected participants to react slower on positive targets when preceded by derogatory rather than category primes, without necessarily reacting faster to negative targets (Hypothesis 1).
As for the comparison between homosexual and heterosexual participants' reactions toward these types of labels, three distinct hypotheses were advanced. First,
because the stereotypes held by the majority group toward a stigmatized minority are
widely presented in the mass media (Wilson & Gutierrez, 1985) and are transmitted
and corroborated throughout interpersonal communication (Giles, 1977; Kashima,
2000; van Dijk, 1987), people normally acquire a rich repertoire of disparaging
terms regardless of whether they are (or are not) personally members of the group
that is the target of such slurs. Also, during their childhood and throughout their subsequent socialization, most gays likely are exposed to the same homophobic ideas as
heterosexuals. In a sense, homosexuals are socialized to become heterosexuals. As a
consequence, the cultural stereotype of gays and the derogatory labels associated
with that group may be just as accessible to homosexuals as they are to heterosexuals (Devine, 1989; Devine & Baker, 1991). Therefore, one would expect participants,
regardless of their sexual orientation, to respond less quickly to positive targets when
primed by derogatory rather than by category labels (Hypothesis 2a).
Alternatively, one may argue that because emotional reactions are more likely to
emerge when perceivers see the target of an offensive act as part of their own group
(Dumont, Yzerbyt, Wigboldus, & Gordijn, 2003; Smith, 1999; Yzerbyt, Dumont,
Wigboldus, & Gordijn, 2003), homosexuals may respond more strongly than heterosexuals to derogatory group labels such as fag. In other words, because they are
likely to feel personally insulted by such language, homosexuals may react even
more negatively to derogatory terms. One may therefore predict that, compared to

148

Journal of Language and Social Psychology

heterosexuals, homosexual participants will react even slower to positive targets and
faster to negative traits when primed by derogatory rather than by category labels
(Hypothesis 2b).
A third, somewhat counterintuitive, possibility is that homosexuals (different from
heterosexuals) react to derogatory labels much the same way as they react to category
labels. There are two interrelated reasons why one may advance this hypothesis. On
one hand, because, from the perspective of a homosexual, both category and derogatory labels refer to the in-group and because the in-group is generally positively evaluated, any reference to that group, even when framed in disparaging terms, may elicit
positive feelings. On the other hand, it is possible that what is conceived as derogatory
in majority speech may have acquired a positive connotation in minority speech. It is
well known that many minority groups import derogatory language, originally created
by hostile majority groups, into minority speech, thereby changing the implicit valence
of such terms. For example, the term nigger frequently appears in Black speech as a
way of referring, in an ironic or even affectionate way, to the in-group (Kennedy,
2002). Along the same line, it has been documented that homosexuals sometimes use
terms such as fairy, fag, queen, and faggot when talking about members of their own
group, particularly when talking among themselves rather than with majority members
(Chauncey, 1994). In other words, minority members often reframe such labels in a
positive manner, reclaiming them as terms of pride. We are not arguing that homosexuals are unable to recognize the disparaging meaning of these labels when used by the
majority, but rather we suggest that, because of the use of such terms in in-group
speech, such disparaging labels may have lost some of their negative connotation.
Consequently, homosexual participants may react faster to positive than to negative
targets regardless of type of prime (Hypothesis 2c).

Method
Participants
A total of 29 heterosexual males and 26 homosexual males volunteered in the present experiment. Their ages ranged from 20 to 33 years.

Procedure
On their arrival at the laboratory, participants were told that they would be participating in a lexical decision task. Specifically, participants were seated in front of a
computer monitor and informed that they had to judge a large number of letter
sequences that appeared on the screen. They were told that they would first see a +
sign at the center of the screen, followed by a letter sequence, and that they would
need to judge whether the sequence constituted a word or not, making their judgment

Carnaghi, Maass / Derogatory Group Labels

149

as quickly and accurately as possible. As will be described below, participants were
then shown 96 lexical decision trials.
After these trials, participants were asked to indicate whether they had seen something on the computer screen that had appeared before the targets and provide their
answer by means of a yes or no choice format. Regardless of whether they had seen
anything, participants were informed that some words were indeed subliminally presented, and they were asked to guess them. None of the participants were able to identify or to correctly guess the prime. Finally, participants were asked to report their
gender, age, and sexual orientation. They were then fully debriefed and dismissed.

LDT Stimuli
During the experimental task, participants were seated at an approximate distance of
50 cm from the computer screen. Participants were asked to focus on the fixation point
(+) at each trial. The fixation point appeared at the center of the screen for 1000 ms and
was instantly followed by the prime. After 15 ms, the prime was replaced by a masking
stimulus XXXXXXXX, which remained on for 250 ms. Then, the target sequence of letters appeared for 250 ms. Participants' two index fingers had previously been positioned
on the two response keys (i.e., letters s and l on an Italian keyboard). Once participants
had responded by pressing one of the two keys, corresponding to word versus no word,
the fixation point reappeared on the screen.
The experiment included four different sorts of subliminal prime words, each presented at one fourth of the trials, namely, homosexual (in Italian, omosessuale), gay (the
same in Italian), fag (in Italian, frocio), and fairy (in Italian, culattone).2 Therefore, on
half of the trials, a category label was used as prime, and on the other half, a derogatory
label was used.3 Each prime occurred on 24 different trials that were all composed in
two blocks. On half of the trials, the prime was followed by a word, on half by a no
word, with no-word and word sequences being paired for length.
The target words were selected on the basis of previous research involving both
homosexual and heterosexual participants (Bianchi, 2002; Carnaghi & Maass, in
press) so that eight of the words were traits stereotypical of gays but counterstereotypical of heterosexuals, eight were counterstereotypical of gays and stereotypical of
heterosexuals, and eight were irrelevant to both gays and heterosexuals. Importantly,
only those adjectives for which there was consensus in the perception of stereotypicality between homosexual and heterosexual respondents were selected for the present study. Moreover, in line with previous research (Wittenbrink et al., 1997), half
of the traits in each category were positive, half negative (see Table 1).

Results
Response latencies faster than 150 ms and slower than 2 standard deviations above
the individual's mean reaction times were deleted. This resulted in an exclusion of 8%

of participants' responses. Participants' reaction times were analyzed by means of a 2
(prime: category vs. derogatory label) x 3 (relevance: stereotypical vs. counterstereotypical vs. irrelevant) x 2 (valence: positive vs. negative) x 2 (sexual orientation: heterosexual vs. homosexual) mixed-model ANOVA with repeated measures on the first
three variables. Although the main effect of sexual orientation was only marginally significant, F(1, 53) = 2.35, p < .13, an inspection of participants' reaction times indicated
that homosexual participants (M = 327.8 ms, SE = 19.95) tended to be faster than heterosexual participants (M = 361.49 ms, SE = 15.1) at reacting to the target words.
Because the experimental material specifically addressed the representation of gays as
a group, it is not surprising that, compared to heterosexual participants, homosexuals
were faster at recognizing self-relevant information. A significant main effect of relevance was also found, F(2, 53) = 6.81, p < .002. Pairwise comparisons revealed that
participants were faster at reacting to stereotypical (M = 334.81 ms, SE = 10.11)
than to irrelevant targets (M = 349. 97 ms, SE = 11.53, p < .002). They were also faster
at responding to stereotypical than counterstereotypical targets (M = 350.07 ms, SE =
12.12, p < .004). However, there was no difference between irrelevant and counterstereotypical targets (p = .88). Importantly, and in line with our predictions, this main
effect was not modified by a higher order interaction with prime, F(2, 53) = 0.65, p >
.43. Also, a main effect of valence emerged, F(1, 53) = 36.74, p < .001. Participants'
reaction times were faster for positive (M = 332.23 ms, SE = 9.76) than for negative
targets (M = 357.06 ms, SE = 12.48).
Of greater theoretical interest is the Prime x Valence x Sexual Orientation interaction, F(1, 53) = 4.07, p < .05 (see Figure 1). Consistent with Hypothesis 1, heterosexual participants were slower to react to positive targets when primed by
derogatory labels than by category labels t(28) = 2.01, p < .05. No difference was
found between derogatory and category primes on negative targets t(28) = .08, ns.
Turning to homosexual participants, in line with Hypothesis 2c but contrary to
Hypothesis 2b, type of prime (derogatory vs. category label) did not affect participants'

Discussion
The present study was set up to attend to two specific goals. First, using a semantic
priming paradigm, we intended to replicate, at least for heterosexual participants,
Carnaghi et al.'s (2005; Carnaghi & Maass, in press) findings showing that derogatory
terms activate less flattering associations than do category labels. Second, we investigated whether derogatory group labels affect minority members, belonging to the group
that is the target of such labels, in the same way as they affect majority members. In
other words, we compared the automatic reactions of heterosexuals and homosexuals
when confronted with category versus derogatory labels concerning gays.
In line with previous findings (Carnaghi et al., 2005; Carnaghi & Maass, in
press), participants were faster at reacting to stereotypical targets than to counterstereotypical and irrelevant targets. However, because the targets were not equated
in length and in frequency, the above results could also be explained in terms of target differences on other properties than their relevance for the category. This claim

152

Journal of Language and Social Psychology

aside, the most important result is the fact that type of prime failed to modify the
above main effect (Carnaghi et al., 2005). Because both types of labels refer to the
same social category, both are equally likely to activate the semantic concepts that
are relevant to homosexuals as a group. Therefore, regardless of language, the category-relevant traits became equally activated in the minds of heterosexual and homosexual participants.
Moreover, as far as heterosexuals were concerned, category and derogatory primes
differed with respect to the valence of the associations they activated. In line with
Hypothesis 1 and with previous results, derogatory, compared to category, labels triggered less positively valenced associations, whereas no difference emerged for negative targets. Again, these results suggest that derogatory group labels mainly differ
from category group labels with respect to the valence of the associations they are
able to elicit. Thus, these results mirrored previous findings (Carnaghi et al., 2005;
Carnaghi & Maass, 2005, in press) demonstrating that what distinguishes derogatory
from category group labels is not so much the ability to activate stereotypical, beliefbased content but the tendency to prevent flattering associations. However, this pattern of results could be also interpreted as a function of a mere evaluative priming
effect. To rule out this interpretation of the effect in question, Carnaghi et al. (2005)
have recently compared the consequences of overhearing derogatory group labels
(i.e., fag) versus derogatory nonsocial labels (i.e., asshole). The authors found that
although those two types of labels did not differ in terms of the evaluative associations they elicited, derogatory group labels, but not derogatory nonsocial labels,
affected participants' explicit attitudes toward homosexuals. As a matter of fact, participants' attitudes toward gays were less positive after the exposure to derogatory
group than derogatory nonsocial labels. Thus, although at the surface both types of
labels look very similar with respect to their evaluative tone, only derogatory group
labels lead to specific group-based reactions.
Furthermore, in line with Hypothesis 2c, participants' sexual orientation seemed
to moderate the impact of type of prime on participants' reactions toward positive
and negative targets. Indeed, although derogatory labels elicited less positive feelings from heterosexual participants than did category labels, homosexual participants were not affected by the type of prime (category vs. derogatory). Rather, these
participants showed a positive reaction to any reference to the in-group, regardless
of whether this was expressed in category or derogatory language.
We believe that there are at least three ways to explain this finding. A first explanation of these results could be offered if one assumes that homosexuals and heterosexuals are differentially exposed to derogatory labels. Because derogatory group
labels are mainly used within the majority group but less frequently when talking to
minority members (Graumann, 1995), one may conclude that homosexuals are less
aware of such labels and of their derogatory connotation simply because they are
rarely exposed to derogatory talk. A recent study by Carnaghi and Maass (in press)
suggests that this is not the case. In this study, both heterosexual and homosexual

participants were asked to judge the offensiveness of several words. Specifically, the
list of the words to be judged also comprised the derogatory labels and the category
labels that we used in the current research. Results showed that heterosexuals and
homosexuals were equally aware of the harmful and offensive meaning associated
with the derogatory group labels in question. In other words, the majority group and
those who are potentially the target of such slurs are equally familiar with such terms
and hold equally accurate perceptions of the sense of offense that these labels are
able to elicit. Thus, differential awareness because of different exposure to derogatory labels does not seem to offer a convincing explanation of our findings.
A second explanation may be offered on the basis that all four terms (gay, homosexual, fag, fairy) define the in-group. Because decades of social identity research
have shown that people generally feel positive about their in-group, it may simply
be irrelevant what kind of cue is used to evoke the in-group. If in-group favoritism
is such a powerful and pervasive phenomenon, homosexual participants may favorably react to any reference to their own group, even when stated in derogatory terms.
Third, one may offer a language-based account assuming that gays use derogatory labels in an affectionate or ironic way in in-group discourse involving two or
more homosexual interlocutors. If epithets are used by the minority with a clearly
friendly intent, then these terms may eventually gain a positive implicit connotation
that is entirely different from the offensive meaning originally intended by the
majority. Assuming that derogatory terms have taken on a different (positive) meaning as a function of repeated use in minority speech, this may explain why these
labels still exert their derogatory function in the majority group but are no longer
conceived as derogatory by the minority group, at least in terms of automatic
responses. The difference between this explanation and the previous one lies in the
fact that, according to the language-based explanation, only those minority groups
that have adopted derogatory terms into their in-group speech should be immune to
the automatic effects of such slurs. For example, Blacks and gays are known to have
imported derogatory terms into their own language (Chauncey, 1994; Kennedy,
2002), whereas we are not aware of any research suggesting that Jews have done
likewise. If epithets change because of a reevaluation in minority talk, then only
minority groups that habitually use them as terms of endearment (e.g., Blacks and
gays) should be immune to the negative effects of such terms. In contrast, our second explanation, based on a generalized in-group favoritism, predicts that any
minority group (including, for example, Jews) should equally react to category and
derogatory labels, simply because both refer to the in-group.
Although the identification of the exact processes is beyond the scope of this article, our study quite clearly demonstrates that majority and minority members have
distinct automatic reactions to derogatory versus category group labels. In heterosexuals, derogatory terms activate much less positive content than do category labels,
whereas homosexuals react in much the same way to derogatory labels as they react
to "politically correct" labels. Although counterintuitive, our results suggest that the

use of derogatory terms referring to homosexuals has more severe automatic consequences for members of the dominant (heterosexual) group than for those who are the
target of such slurs. However, because our findings came from a subliminal priming
paradigm, which differs from everyday situations, great caution should be taken in
generalizing our findings to contexts in which people overtly listen to derogatory
terms or are addressed in a derogatory manner. As a matter of fact, the present study
only addressed the differential accessibility of the prejudicial constructs that followed
the exposure to category or derogatory terms in a sample of homosexuals and heterosexuals. Future work along the lines followed in the present study should help us
to delineate how homosexuals and heterosexuals may differently react when overtly
exposed to derogatory group labels.
From a practical point of view, this suggests that it may indeed be relevant to bolster political correctness norms that steer social speech acts, at least in the presence
of dominant group members, regardless of whether the minority takes the role of the
interlocutor or is simply the topic of the conversation.

Notes
1. Terrone is a widely known derogatory term referring to southern Italians.
2. To secure us the derogatory tone of both derogatory primes, a pilot study was conducted on heterosexual and homosexual participants. Participants were presented with two derogatory group labels
concerning homosexuals (i.e., fag and fairy), two category labels regarding the same group (i.e., gay and
homosexual), two highly offensive ("hard") slurs unrelated to homosexuality (i.e., asshole and bastard),
and two soft slurs unrelated to homosexuality (i.e., silly and stupid). Participants were told to indicate the
extent to which they perceived each of the listed items as offensive. Results clearly indicated that heterosexuals and homosexuals equally considered the derogatory group label the most harmful (M = 5.23, SD =
1.72), followed by the hard slur (M = 4.73, SD = 1.67), the light slur (M = 3.23, SD = 1.29), and, least
offensive, the category label (M = 2.04, SD = 1.73).
3. It is important to notice that the primes were, on the average, very similar in length (M = 7 letters
for the category primes and M = 7.5 for the derogatory primes).
