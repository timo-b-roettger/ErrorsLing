The Effect of Classroom
Emotions, Attitudes Toward
English, and Teacher
Behavior on Willingness to
Communicate Among English
Foreign Language Learners
Jean-Marc Dewaele1

Abstract
Willingness to communicate (WTC) in a foreign language is linked to a range of
interacting learner-internal and learner-external variables. The present study
identified the predictors of WTC of 210 foreign language learners of English from
Spain. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the strongest (negative) predictor of
WTC was foreign language classroom anxiety, while foreign language enjoyment and
frequency of foreign language use by the teacher were positive predictors.

anxiety, attitudes toward teacher, attitudes toward foreign language

As a young lecturer of French as a foreign language (FL) in a higher education institute in Flanders in the early 1990s, I was asked to teach French conversation classes to
future translators and interpreters. My highbrow conversation topics met a wall of
silence, and my questions elicited one-word replies. As a sense of despair grabbed me,
I realized that my task was to have my students practice their French and that the conversation topic was of little importance. I realized that their daily life experiences
might generate more interest than the issue of acid rain or the fall of the Berlin wall.

From that point on, conversations (in French) flowed seamlessly, about who had been
drunk at the last school party, who had vomited in the gutter, who had flirted with
whom. I had managed to raise students' engagement and, as a good actor, I had succeeded in making them believe that I was interested in what they had to say, which was
exhausting in itself. Later, I discovered that the problem of overcoming students' (initial) unwillingness to communicate was not new nor unique. Students' silence reflects
low willingness to communicate (WTC) in the FL, which has been defined as "a readiness to enter into discourse at a particular time with a specific person or persons"
(MacIntyre, Clement, Dornyei, & Noels, 1998, p. 547).
The concept of WTC emerged in the first language communication literature
(McCroskey & Richmond, 1991), where it was considered to be a stable personality
trait. Specialists in FL learning and teaching saw the potential pedagogical benefits of
research on WTC and reframed it adopting a more dynamic perspective (MacIntyre
et al., 1998). MacIntyre (2007) conceptualized WTC as a "volitional (freely chosen)
process . . . with the potential to rise and fall rapidly as the situation changes" (p. 564).
Further research considered WTC's more enduring learner-internal characteristics
(i.e., personality traits) and more transient learner-external characteristics (i.e., social
environment, peers).
Gaining a better understanding of WTC is important because of the pedagogical
implications, as teachers may realize that some learners may be less talkative than
others because of their personality profile, but that by creating the optimal social
and emotional context, the WTC of all learners can be raised (Dewaele & Dewaele,
2018; Joe, Hiver, & Al-Hoorie, 2017; Khajavy, MacIntyre, & Barabadi, 2018). The
main purpose of the current study is thus to identify the independent variables
linked to WTC that can help teachers create the optimal environment to harness
learners' emotions, boosting their WTC and, by extension, their progress in the FL
(Dewaele, 2015).

Literature Review
The theoretical basis of recent work on WTC is MacIntyre et al.'s (1998) multilayered
pyramid model of WTC (see Figure 1). The bottom layer (Layer VI) consists of the
most stable macrosocial variables and psychological variables, the layers above reflect
variables that are more changeable and context dependent, with WTC as Layer II, just
below the top layer, which represents actual second language use.
One recent avenue of investigation has been into the psychological and socioemotional sources of variation in WTC, spread over Layers VI, V, IV, and III.
MacIntyre and Doucette (2010) investigated WTC inside and outside of the FL
class of 238 Anglo-Canadian high school learners of French. WTC inside class was
negatively predicted by language anxiety and volatility, characterized as a tendency
to abandon tasks and remain silent. Perceived competence was a positive predictor
of WTC.
The direct and indirect effects of classroom context and emotion were also at the
heart of Joe et al.'s (2017) study on WTC on 381 Korean EFL learners. They found

Dewaele

Figure 1. Pyramid model of willingness to communicate (MacIntyre et al., 1998).

that WTC was predicted directly and indirectly by satisfaction of learners' basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), followed by classroom
climate (teacher academic support, teacher emotional support, and classroom mutual
respect), and to a lesser degree by prior achievement and identified regulation. The
authors concluded that WTC is determined by a combination of individual and contextual variables.
A similar interest in the dynamics of WTC led Khajavy et al. (2018) to conduct a
multilevel investigation into the role of learners' emotions (enjoyment and anxiety)
and classroom environment on WTC of 1,528 secondary school learners of English in
Iran. The authors found that higher WTC was linked to a positive classroom environment. Moreover, higher foreign language enjoyment (FLE) and lower anxiety were
linked to higher WTC.
Dewaele and Dewaele (2018) observed that a pyramid might not be the best way
to visualize the interaction between (potentially interacting) independent variables
and WTC. They suggested a set of expanding concentric circles moving from
learner-internal variables (learners' sociobiographical and psychological characteristics) at the center and outer circles consisting first of intergroup variables within
the classroom (perception of peers and teachers) and at a macroscale (attitudes
toward the FL outside the classroom, historical and political context, and intergroup
relations) to determine the emotional state of the FL user, which will in turn affect

526

their WTC. Such a conceptualization is particularly useful for researchers who are
interested in the effects of learners' classroom emotions on WTC, both of which are
constantly fluctuating and simultaneously shaped by learner-internal and learnerexternal variables over different time spans. The study focused on the WTC of 189
British secondary school learners who were studying a FL in Greater London, the
United Kingdom. The strongest negative predictor of WTC was foreign language
classroom anxiety (FLCA). Weaker positive predictors included frequent FL use by
the teacher, a positive attitude toward the FL, social FLE, and age. The authors concluded that teachers can boost WTC by creating a positive emotional classroom
environment where FL use dominates and where pupils can overcome their anxiety.
Moreover, by generating a genuine interest in the FL and the culture it represents,
teachers can encourage their pupils to use the FL.
The final study to be included in this very brief literature review does not deal with
WTC but with the effect that teachers' characteristics have on FLE and FLCA of the
same 210 participants on which the present study is based. Dewaele, Franco Magdalena,
and Saito (2019) found that teacher characteristics predicted close to 20% of variance
in FLE but only 8% of variance in FLCA. Teacher's friendliness strongly predicted
FLE, while a teacher's strong foreign accent in English was linked to lower FLE.
Participants reported less FLCA with older teachers, teachers who were not overly
strict, and teachers who used English a lot in class. Because teachers influence not
only their students' emotions but also their WTC (Dewaele & Dewaele, 2018), teacher
characteristics will be included in the present research design. An overview of the
findings on the sources of WTC is presented in Table 1.
One of the striking patterns to emerge from the literature review is that attitudes
toward the FL and culture are rarely included in the search of predictors of WTC.
This is relatively surprising considering that all the studies cited here referred to
MacIntyre et al.'s (1998) pyramid model, where macrosocial variables (e.g., intergroup climate and intergroup attitudes) are at the base of the WTC pyramid. The
only study where attitudes were measured toward FLs that did not include English
(Dewaele & Dewaele, 2018) did show that these attitudes predicted students' WTC.
It remains to be seen whether attitudes toward English as a FL, which because of its
status as a global lingua franca is less linked to any specific population group
(Yashima, Zenuk-Nishide, & Shimizu, 2004), might also predict unique variance in
classroom WTC of Spanish learners of English. The general research question is
thus to find out to what extent learner-internal and learner-external variables predict
Spanish learners' WTC in English.

Method
Participants
A total of 210 participants (151 females, 58 males, 1 preferred not to say) completed
the online questionnaire. Participants' age ranged from 18 to 63 years (M = 25.6 years,
SD = 9.12 years). Participants were Spanish and had Spanish as their first language.

They had recently studied (or were studying) English as a FL at different levels of
education, with 65% at university, 24% at secondary school, and 11% in other institutions. Participants were asked to report the grade they obtained on their last major
English test (M = 76.6%, SD = 17%).

Instrument
After filling out the demographics sections, participants were asked about their attitude toward English as a FL on a 5-point Likert-type scale: Responses ranged from
very unfavorable (1), unfavorable (2), neutral (3), favorable (4), and very favorable
(5). The mean score was 4.5 (SD = 0.8). The same descriptors were used to determine
attitudes toward the FL teacher. The mean score was 3.8 (SD = 1.0).
The next question enquired about their FL teacher's friendliness, with responses
ranging from very unfriendly (1), unfriendly (2), neutral (3), friendly (4), to very
friendly (5). The mean score was 4.0 (SD = 1.0).
Participants were then asked about their FL teacher's strictness, with responses
ranging from not strict at all (1), a little strict (2), rather strict (3), strict (4), to very
strict (5). The mean score was 2.7 (SD = 1.1). The following question focused on the
teacher's frequency of use of the FL in class, with responses ranging from hardly ever
(1), not very often (2), sometimes (3), usually (4), to all the time (5). The mean score
was 4.4 (SD = 0.9).

The final question in this section asked whether the teacher had a foreign accent in
the FL. The responses ranged from not at all (1), a little (2), moderate (3), quite strong
(4), and very strong (5). The mean score was 2.0 (SD = 1.1).
Participants then completed the FLE questionnaire used in Dewaele et al. (2018).
Possible responses to 10 items on aspects of private and social FLE ranged from
strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), undecided (3), agree (4), to strongly agree (5). All
items were positively phrased. A scale analysis revealed high internal consistency
(Cronbach's  = .87). The mean score for FLE was 3.9 (SD = 0.5). Another eight
items were extracted from the Foreign Language Anxiety Scale and reflected physical
symptoms of anxiety, nervousness, and lack of confidence (Horwitz, Horwitz, &
Cope, 1986). They also captured the reliability of the original scale (Dewaele &
MacIntyre, 2014). A scale analysis revealed high internal consistency (Cronbach's 
= .85). The mean score for FLCA was 2.8 (SD = 1.0).

Dependent Variable
A final section contained eight items developed by MacIntyre about the likelihood
to start a conversation in a FL in hypothetical scenarios with known and unknown
interlocutors in a range of different situations (see the appendix). Likert-type scales
had anchors ranging from almost never willing (1), sometimes willing (2), willing
half of the time (3), usually willing (4), to almost always willing (5). Internal reliability was good (Cronbach's  = .80). The mean score for WTC was 3.54 (SD =
0.87). Although a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the distribution was not normal because of a slight skew toward the high end of the scale
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z = .081, p < .002), a Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot)
showed that the WTC scores follow a normal distribution reasonably well except for
the extreme tail (see Figure 2). I thus opted for the more powerful parametric statistics, namely, Pearson correlation analyses and stepwise multiple regression analyses. Green (1991) suggested that the minimum sample size for any regression should
be 50, with an additional eight observations per term. This means that the minimum
sample size for a multiple regression analysis with 10 independent variables is 130,
which is well below our sample size of 210.

Results
Preliminary Pearson correlation analyses with a Bonferroni correction (p < .005)
revealed that 7 out of the 10 independent variables were significantly linked to WTC
(see Table 2). FLCA was the only variable to be significantly negatively correlated
with WTC. Further analysis will permit the calculation of the exact amount of variance
that each independent variable explains in WTC.
An analysis of intercorrelations of the independent variables showed that none
were too highly correlated, which means there is no danger of multicollinearity in the
regression analysis (see Table 3).

Positive predictors of WTC included FLE, explaining an additional 11.6% of variance ( = .32, p < .0001) (see Figure 4), and teacher's frequency of FL use, which
explained a final 2.7% of variance ( = .17, p < .004) (see Figure 5).

Discussion
The findings suggest that attitudes toward the FL explain no unique variance in
classroom WTC of Spanish EFL learners. The significant positive correlation
between attitudes toward the FL and WTC disappeared in the multiple regression
analysis. This is in contrast with the finding in Dewaele and Dewaele (2018), where
attitudes toward French predicted unique variance in WTC. A possible explanation
is that the link between the French language and culture is tighter in the mind of
learners than the link between English language and culture. In other words, English
as FL learners may be less interested in any specific English-speaking culture
(British, North American, or Australian) or country and just want to learn a global
lingua franca (Yashima et al., 2004). British learners of French may be more focused
on France, its language, and its culture.
The strongest negative predictor of WTC was FLCA, explaining 30% of variance, confirming previous research (Dewaele & Dewaele, 2018; Joe et al., 2017;
Khajavy et al., 2018; MacIntyre & Doucette, 2010; Yashima et al., 2018). Learners'
classroom anxiety drains their WTC. However, the results also show that WTC
benefits from increased FLE and frequent FL use by the teacher (explaining an
additional 15% of variance). Interpreting these results requires caution. Dewaele

communicate (WTC).

and MacIntyre (2014) pointed out that FLE and FLCA are two separate but related
dimensions of experience that are not in a strict seesaw relationship. In other words,
strategies to combat FLCA do not automatically boost FLE. Similarly, low FLCA is
no guarantee for an increased WTC, as disengaged students typically lack enjoyment as well as anxiety while highly engaged students can experience high FLCA
and FLE simultaneously (Dewaele & MacIntyre, 2014; Dewaele, Witney, Saito, &
Dewaele, 2018). Moreover, students who score high on Neuroticism are more likely
to suffer from FLCA, over which teachers have relatively little control, but teacher
actions can boost FLE (Dewaele & MacIntyre, 2019). Teachers should therefore
create a positive but sufficiently challenging classroom environment to lower learners' anxiety (Oxford, 2017) while offering them the opportunity to go beyond
superficial pleasure: "If pleasure can occur simply by performing an activity or
completing an action, enjoyment takes on additional dimensions such as an intellectual focus, heightened attention, and optimal challenge" (Boudreau, MacIntyre,
& Dewaele, 2018, p. 153). Classroom activities that involved a certain amount of
learner autonomy were frequently mentioned as highly enjoyable in Dewaele and
MacIntyre (2014).
Finally, what is the role of the variables that turned out not to predict any unique
variance in WTC? Three variables were not significantly correlated with WTC,
namely, participants' age, as well as the teacher's accent and strictness. It means that
even a strict teacher with a strong foreign accent in English is perfectly able to convince adult learners to communicate in English. The four variables that did not explain
unique variance in WTC, namely, attitude toward the teacher, attitude toward English,

Dewaele

533

the teacher's friendliness, and learners' test results may in fact have an indirect effect
on WTC through FLCA and FLE. Indeed, the same participants experienced more
FLE with friendly teachers, who were more likely to use English frequently in class
and not be overly strict. Dewaele and Dewaele (2017) and Dewaele et al. (2018) also
found that attitudes toward the teacher and the FL, as well as the teachers' frequency
of use of the FL and the opportunity to speak frequently in class predicted FLE. On the
other hand, a negative attitude toward the FL was linked with higher levels of FLCA.
What this suggests is that WTC is at the heart of a complex and highly dynamic web
of interacting emotions, which are themselves affected by a range of learner-internal
and learner-external variables. Some of these variables are hard to measure but can
play a vital role in the decision to speak or not (Boudreau et al., 2018).
The pedagogical implication is that for learners to dare to use their FL in the classroom, surrounded by their peers and teacher, it is crucial for them to be in a nonthreatening, positive, emotional climate, where linguistic experimentation is accepted,
where errors do not lead to ridicule, and where WTC is nurtured like any young sapling (Dewaele et al., 2018). Further interdisciplinary research into WTC could delve
further in this tangled web of direct and indirect effects. It would be particularly interesting to see to what extent local intergroup attitudes affect WTC of learners acquiring
two or more FLs simultaneously.

Conclusion
The present study showed that adult Spanish learners' WTC in English was dampened
by anxiety but strengthened by enjoyment and frequency of use of English by the
teacher. My own anecdote about my Flemish students, combined with ample research
findings, suggests that while some variables affecting WTC are beyond the teacher's
control, others can be gently manipulated to boost learners' WTC. It involves creating
a friendly and sufficiently challenging and interesting emotional classroom environment and picking conversation topics that match the students' interests.
