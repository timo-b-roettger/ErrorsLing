A high prevalence of central auditory processing disorders (CAPD) has been
reported in the elderly based on scores for the Synthetic Sentence Identification
Test (SSI). This study examined practice effects and list differences on the Auditec
version of the SSI with an ipsilateral competing message in 30 young and 20
elderly participants. Results for the younger participants suggested that a
minimum of one practice list should be used with the SSI, whereas results for the
elderly participants suggested that a minimum of three practice lists should be
used. The binomial model of A. R. Thornton and M. J. M. Raffin (1978) was
suggested for use in determining the required number of lists needed to obtain
reliable SSI performance. Significant list differences were found with the Auditec
version of the SSI. It was recommended to use only Lists A, C, D, E, G, and I for
consistent results across lists. Practice effects and list differences should be accounted
for when using the SSI for the assessment of CAPD in elderly and young listeners.

he Synthetic Sentence Identification (SSI) test was developed as
an alternative to traditional word-recognition testing. The SSI is a
closed-set test consisting of 10 nonsense sentences constructed to
approximate the syntactic structure of English (Speaks and Jerger, 1965).
Several commercial versions of the SSI combine the sentences with a
competing message of continuous discourse related to the life of Davy
Crockett. The SSI presented with this competing message has been used
extensively as a measure of central auditory processing (Cooper & Gates,
1991; Fire, Lesner, & Newman, 1991; Jerger & Jerger, 1975; Strouse,
Hall, & Burger, 1995).
Based on SSI test results, the elderly have been reported to have a
50% or greater prevalence of central auditory processing disorders
(CAPD; Jerger, Jerger, Oliver, & Pirozzolo, 1989; Jerger, Oliver, &
Pirozzolo, 1990; Rodriguez, DiSarno, & Hardiman, 1990; Stach,
Spretnjak, & Jerger, 1990). These results were challenged by Humes,
Christopherson, and Cokely (1992), who suggested that these remarkably high prevalence data might have been a function of poor SSI test
reliability in the elderly. The studies cited have typically used SSI rollover,
a decrease in the SSI score at high intensities compared to the maximum score, of more than 20% as a positive finding for CAPD. However,
because the SSI test consists of only 10 items, there can be considerable

variability across list presentations for a given individual. Humes, Chrisopherson, and Cokely used the binomial model proposed by Thornton and Raffin (1978)
to show that for a true score of 60% on a 10-item SSI
list, only scores of 0 or 10% could be considered significantly different (p < .05). Therefore, a score of 30%, which
would be considered to be significant rollover from a
maximum score of 60%, would not be statistically different from 60%. Thus, poor SSI test reliability could
lead to misdiagnosis of CAPD.
Humes, Chrisopherson, and Cokely (1992) also
pointed to the evidence of poor reliability of the SSI in
terms of practice effects. The provision of sufficient practice trials prior to final data collection has been reported
to improve the reliability and validity of the SSI (Beattie
& Clark, 1982; Dubno & Dirks, 1983; Jerger, Speaks, &
Trammel, 1968). Based on their clinical experience with
the SSI, Jerger, Speaks, and Trammel (1968) stated that
asymptotic performance on the SSI with the ipsilateral
Davy Crockett competing message was achieved by most
listeners after the presentation of three 10-item SSI lists.
However, they recommended that as many as 10 lists
be used when "a single score must represent a given
condition, as, for example, in the comparison of different hearing aids" (p. 327). Beattie and Clark (1982) presented the SSI sentences with an ipsilateral competing
message (SSI-ICM) of four-talker babble instead of the
Davy Crockett passage to 16 young adults at six message-to-competition ratios (MCRs) from -6 to +4 dB.
They reported a pronounced practice effect with a maximal improvement in average scores of nearly 40 percentage points from the first to the fourth list at an MCR
of +4 dB. Dubno and Dirks (1983) presented the SSIICM to hearing-impaired listeners ranging in age from
15 to 81 years in the presence of cafeteria noise at an
MCR selected such that responses were around 50%
correct. They found significant differences between
scores for the first two trials of a day and Trials 3 and 6.
When only the last four of six trials were included in
the analysis, there were no measurable practice effects.
In contrast to these findings, a recent study by Pugh,
Crandell, and Griffiths (1998) reported no practice effects for young adults on the SSI-ICM using the commercially available compact disk (CD) recording of the SSI
test from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Two
competing signals were used in that study to produce the
ICM condition: multitalker babble and the Davy Crockett
passage recorded on the second channel of the CD recording. Pugh, Crandell, and Griffiths used an adaptive procedure to vary the MCR within each SSI list to achieve
a speech-recognition threshold (SRT) based on a criterion score of 50%. Nine SSI lists were presented in each
noise condition on two days for a total of 18 lists in each
condition. There was no significant difference in the
average SRT across days for either noise condition.

Remarkably, there are no studies in the literature
that have directly examined SSI practice effects in a
group of elderly listeners. Given that Pugh, Crandell,
and Griffiths (1998) found no practice effect on the SSI
with young listeners, it is plausible that a difference
exists between young and elderly listeners in terms of
practice effects on the SSI. One goal of the present study
was to examine SSI practice effects in young and elderly listeners.
SSI test reliability may also be affected by differences among test lists. The SSI test consists of the same
10 sentences in a different order for each list. Martin
and Mussell (1979) suggested that list differences could
stem from differences in the acoustic gaps in the discourse of the Davy Crockett passage across lists. This
was supported by the data of Pugh, Crandell, and
Griffiths (1998) who reported differences among lists for
the VA version of the SSI-ICM for the Davy Crockett
competition, but not for a multitalker babble condition.
When the SSI was recorded for the VA CD, lists were
recorded from a master tape with no attempt to temporally align the SSI lists on one channel of the CD with
the Davy Crockett passage on the second channel to
preserve the original temporal alignment of the SSI
(R. H. Wilson, personal communication, 1998). Thus, SSI
list differences may vary across different commercial
recordings of the SSI. List differences have not been
examined for another commonly used commercial recording of the SSI from Auditec of St. Louis.
Normative data from elderly listeners are needed
on the SSI. Such data have important implications for
both test administration and the interpretation of results in this population. Specifically, low SSI reliability
in terms of practice and list effects may have contributed to the high prevalence of CAPD reported for the
elderly. The goals of the present study were (a) to examine practice effects for the SSI-ICM in young and elderly listeners and (b) to examine list effects for the same
participants on the Auditec version of the SSI test.

Method
Participants
The young group consisted of 30 university students,
26 women and 4 men, aged 18 to 24 years (M = 20.3
years). The inclusion criteria were a negative history of
hearing problems and pure-tone thresholds of 20 dB HL
or better from 250 to 8000 Hz. The group of 20 elderly
participants consisted of 9 women and 11 men, aged 60
to 80 years (M = 71.1 years). They were recruited from
flyers placed across campus and at local retirement centers. Inclusion criteria included (a) an average pure-tone
threshold for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz of 25 dB HL in
the test ear, (b) word recognition in the test ear for a

higher at a level of 50 dB SL, (c) corrected vision adequate to respond correctly to the written command of
the Mini-Mental State Exam (see below), (d) a negative
history of stroke or other neurological disorder, and (e)
a passing score on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE;
Cockrell & Folstein, 1988), an 11-item cognitive screening test. The MMSE contains questions such as "What
is the year?" and "Where are we (country, town, etc.)?" in
addition to asking the participant to do such things as
write a sentence, copy a design, or respond to the written command printed in 12-point font: "CLOSE YOUR
EYES." The mean pure-tone thresholds for this group
at the audiometric frequencies are shown in Table 1.

The verbal response for each item was recorded by the
experimenter who monitored the participant from the
control room.

Procedure

To soften the effect that the large List J difference
might have on practice effects in the smaller group of 20
elderly participants, List J was dropped for that group.
The elderly participants were also provided with a single
SSI list (List A) prior to data collection as a means of familiarizing them with the task. This was done because
an elderly participant in pilot testing did not respond to
some items in the first SSI list due to confusion over the
task. List A was chosen for this application because the
performance on List A in pilot testing was more similar to
the difficulty of the remaining lists than List J, and because it was thought that List A would not be an appropriate list to show practice effects due to its difficulty. The
presentation level of the SSI for this group was 50 dB
SL referenced to the pure-tone average (500, 1000, and
2000 Hz) rounded up to the nearest 5 dB. The MCR was
selected as -10 dB based on pilot testing that revealed
average scores at this MCR of 70%. It was again reasoned that this MCR would avoid ceiling effects. Final
data collection consisted of eight SSI lists, B through I,
presented to each participant in a random order.

The participants were seated in a double-walled
sound booth for all tests involving audiometeric inclusion criteria. Testing was completed with a Madsen,
Model 622, clinical audiometer with ER-3A insert earphones calibrated to ANSI (S3.6-1996) standards. A
taped version of the CID W-22 test was routed to the
audiometer from a Denon, Model DRW-580, cassette tape
deck for word-recognition testing of the elderly participants. The level of the W-22 test was set at 50 dB above
the pure-tone average for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.
The MMSE was administered to each elderly participant in a quiet room following audiometric testing.
All elderly participants passed this cognitive screening
with a score of 30 out of a possible 30 points.
The participants were also seated in the doublewalled sound booth for the administration of the SSI
test. The Denon cassette deck was routed to the Madsen
audiometer for presentation of the SSI test lists. The
Auditec cassette-tape version of SSI with contralateral
competing message was administered to each participant in the ICM mode by routing the Davy Crockett
passage from one channel of the cassette tape to the
same ear as the synthetic sentences from the other channel. The test was administered to the right ear of each
participant using an ER-3A insert phone unless that ear
failed to meet the audiometric criteria in which case the
left ear was tested (n = 2). The participant selected an
SSI sentence by announcing its number from the printed

For the 30 young participants, the presentation level
of SSI sentences was 50 dB HL with a -20 dB MCR.
This MCR was chosen to reduce the likelihood of ceiling
effects based on pilot testing demonstrating scores near
70%. All 10 SSI lists were presented in random order
with no practice. Pilot data had shown a trend toward
much higher scores for SSI List J than the other lists,
and lower-than-average scores for Lists A, B, and F.
Because of these expected list differences, a larger group
of young participants was used than elderly to reduce
the effect of list differences on practice effects.

Results
List Effects
Young Participants
Figure 1 shows the mean percent-correct SSI scores
for the young participants as a function of list. Prior to
data analysis an arcsine transform was applied to the
SSI scores for each participant to stabilize the binomial sampling variability. A further correction in proportion was also used to transform extreme scores (0%
and 100%) (Brownlee, 1965; Dubno & Dirks, 1983). An
ANOVA performed with the within-subjects factor of
list (k = 10) yielded a significant difference across lists
[F(1, 9) = 18.4, p < .001]. A series of post hoc t tests was
used to examine differences between each of the 10 lists,
with a total of 45 comparisons. The Holm's adjustment
for an alpha level of .05 was used to take into account

from the list marked by the solid arrow. In addition to
being significantly different from List J, mean scores
for List F were also significantly different from those
for Lists C, D, and H. Lists A, C, D, E, G, and I were not
significantly different from each other but were different from Lists B, F, H, and J.

Elderly Participants
Mean SSI scores across lists are shown in Figure 2
for the elderly participants. An ANOVA performed with
the within-subjects factor of list (k = 8) yielded a significant difference across lists [F(1, 7) = 7.14, p < .001]. A
series of 28 post hoc t tests was used to examine differences between each of the eight lists presented. Significant contrasts across lists are illustrated with arrows
in Figure 2. There were significant differences between
List F and Lists C, D, H, and I, and between List B and
Lists C and H using the Holm's adjustment for an alpha
level of 0.05.

Practice Effects
Young Participants
Mean results for each trial are shown in Figure 3.
The error bars represent 1 standard deviation of the
mean. Average scores ranged from 38% on Trial 1 to 65.7%
on Trial 10. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was performed on the arcsine-transformed data for the
young participants, with a within-subjects factor of trial
(k = 10). A significant difference in the SSI scores was
found across trials [F(1, 9) = 8.9, p < .001]. A series of
post hoc paired-samples t tests was used to examine differences between each of the 10 trials, with a total of 45
comparisons using the Holm's adjustment for an alpha
level of .05. Significant differences were found between
Trial 1 and all other trials. There was also a significant
difference between Trial 2 and Trial 9. It would appear
from an examination of Figure 3 that Trial 10, with a
slightly higher mean score than Trial 9, should also be
significantly different from Trial 2. However, this was
not so because the paired-samples t test takes into account the correlation between two sets of paired numbers, which was stronger between Trials 2 and 9 than
between Trials 2 and 10, resulting in the lack of significance for the latter.
The data for SSI trials for the young group were
reanalyzed using only the lists found to be equivalent:
A, C, D, E, G, and I. This was done to reduce the effect
that the significant list differences might have on the

between each of the 10 trials with a total of 45 comparisons using the Holm's adjustment for an alpha level of

significant contrasts across trials. Thus, the statistical
analysis using only the retained lists showed a practice
effect only for the first trial for this group.

Elderly Participants
The mean scores for each trial for the elderly participants are shown in Figure 5. The error bars represent 1 standard deviation of the mean. Average scores
ranged from 59.5% on Trial 1 to 78.5% on Trial 8. An

for the elderly participants with a within-subjects factor of trial (k = 8). A significant difference was found
across trials [F(1, 7) = 4.7, p < .001]. Post hoc t tests
were again used to examine differences between each of
the eight trials with a total of 28 comparisons. Significant differences were found between Trials 1 and 6 and
between Trials 1 and 8 using the Holm's adjustment for
an alpha level of .05.

for all lists. The analysis including only data for the retained lists suggests that performance may not stabilize until after two trials. However, because the assumption of compound symmetry is not tenable using only
the analysis of the retained lists, the latter finding should
be interpreted with caution.
The average score for the eight trials for the elderly
participants was plotted against participant age as
shown in Figure 7. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the average transformed scores
and participant age was significant, r = -0.56, p = .011,
suggesting that the average performance decreased with
age. The relationship between average SSI scores and
pure-tone thresholds was also examined for the elderly
participants. The Pearson product-moment correlation
coefficient between the average transformed scores and
the pure-tone average for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz (PTA1)
was not significant (r = -0.36, p = .12). The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the average
transformed scores and the pure-tone average for 1000,
2000, and 4000 Hz (PTA2) was also not significant (r =
-0.18, p = .44).

To examine the role that hearing sensitivity might
have played in the relationship between age and mean
SSI scores, partial correlation coefficients were calculated between the average transformed scores and participant age with the effect of pure-tone average held
constant. There was a moderate negative partial correlation between average transformed scores and participant age with the effect of PTA1 held constant (r = -0.67,
p = .002). There was also a moderate negative correlation between average transformed scores and participant age with the effect of PTA2 held constant (r = -0.62,
p = .005). These results suggest that even with the effect of pure-tone sensitivity held constant, average performance on the SSI decreased with age.

Discussion
List Effects

across trials [F(1, 7) = 3.04, p < .01]. Post hoc t tests
were again used to examine differences between each of
the eight trials with a total of 28 comparisons using the
Holm's adjustment for an alpha level of .05. Significant
differences were found between Trials 1 and 8 and between Trials 2 and 8. There were no other significant contrasts across trials. Therefore, the statistical analysis
using only the retained lists showed a practice effect for
the first two trials for this group.
The mean performance for the elderly participants
stabilized after one trial according to the analysis of data

The data from both the young and elderly groups
demonstrated marked differences among lists of the
Auditec of St. Louis version of the SSI test. As the synthetic sentences themselves are identical across lists,
these differences stem from differences in the continuous discourse (Davy Crockett passage) across lists, as
was suggested by Martin and Mussell (1979). For the
Auditec taped version of the SSI used in this study, List J
resulted in mean scores that were nearly 40 percentage
points higher than the scores for List F, which resulted
in the lowest mean scores. The pattern of list effects
was similar for the young and elderly listeners, although
the elderly listeners were not presented with List J and
received List A only as a practice list prior to the start of

data collection. For the young participants six lists resulted in similar mean scores that were not significantly
different from each other, A, C, D, E, G, and I. Six lists
also met these criteria for the elderly participants, C,
D, E, G, H, and I. Because the results for the young
listeners were based on a larger sample size than for
the elderly listeners, and because they received all 10
lists, it is suggested that Lists A, C, D, E, G, and I be
used from the Auditec SSI-CCM test tape to achieve consistent performance across lists. These six lists should
be used when comparing two or more listening conditions such as performance for the right and left ears. If
more than six lists are required, it is suggested that the
same lists be repeated rather than relying on any of the
other four Auditec SSI lists.

Practice Effects
Significant practice effects were observed for the
SSI-ICM for both the young and elderly groups. Including all the SSI lists for the young participants, the average score for the first trial was significantly different
from all other trials. Trial 2 was also significantly different from Trial 9. When only the equivalent lists were
included in the analysis, the young participants required
one practice trial. These results suggest that to ensure
that group performance has stabilized prior to data collection with young-adult listeners at an MCR of -20 dB,
a single SSI list could be used for practice.

An examination of the relationship between the
percent-correct SSI score and age for the elderly participants revealed a moderate negative correlation (r =
-0.56). This decrease in scores with age was not accounted for by peripheral hearing status, as there were
still moderate negative partial correlations between
mean scores and participant age with the effects of PTA1
and PTA2 held constant. Thus, this could be a reflection of increased CAPD with age. However, other factors may also contribute to this finding, such as a
greater need for practice on the SSI with the elderly as
suggested by the present study. The interpretation of
the available literature is problematic on this issue as
most studies fail to report whether practice on the SSI
was provided prior to data collection and, if so, how
much (Gates et al., 1995, 1996; Jerger, Jerger, Oliver, &
Pirozzolo, 1989; Rodriguez, DiSarno, & Hardiman, 1990;
Stach, Spretnjak, & Jerger, 1990).
The averaged trial data from this study suggest that
a minimum of one practice list with young listeners and
three practice lists with the elderly should be used prior
to clinical data collection with the SSI. Because individual learning curves in both groups were found to be
variable and because score reliability is low with a single
10-item list, it is recommended that, following practice,
several subsequent SSI lists be averaged to arrive at a
final SSI score in a given condition, as suggested by
Jerger, Speaks, and Trammel (1968).

This need for practice is consistent with previous
reports of practice effects with the SSI (Beattie & Clark,
1982; Dubno & Dirks, 1983; Jerger, Speaks, & Trammel, 1968), but typically three or more trials have been
recommended for practice. However, those studies either
included participants over the age of 30 years (Beattie
& Clark, 1982; Dubno & Dirks, 1983), were based on
clinical observation rather than empirical data (Jerger,
Speaks, & Trammel, 1968), or included participants with
hearing impairment (Dubno & Dirks, 1983). Pugh,
Crandell, and Griffiths (1998) found no practice effect
on the SSI with young listeners. However, they suggested
that practice effects in that study may have been obscured by averaging data across unequal SSI lists for
the VA version of the SSI.

The data of Thornton and Raffin (1978) can be referenced when determining the number of lists to average based on the binomial model for the presumed true
score of interest. For example, to return to the case mentioned in the introduction, assume that one is using
rollover of the SSI-ICM performance intensity function
of greater than 20% as an index of CAPD. When using a
10-item list, if the maximum score is 60%, a score must
be 20% or less to be reliably different (p < .05). In this
case, a score of 30% on a 10-item list is not significantly
different from 60% and should not be considered significant rollover. However, if a 50-item list were used, a
score less than 42% would be significantly lower than
60%. Therefore, one would need to use at least five SSI
lists (50 sentences) in this case in order to determine if
the rollover criterion of 20% were reliably met (p < .05).

The average data for the elderly listeners using the
retained lists demonstrated that two trials were necessary to eliminate a practice effect (Figure 6). However,
given that the elderly participants received a familiarization list (SSI List A) prior to starting the main experiment, the results suggest that elderly listeners
should receive at least three practice trials to establish
stable performance. Thus, the averaged data using the
retained lists suggest that elderly listeners require more
practice on the SSI than young listeners.

SSI scores should be interpreted cautiously if list
differences are ignored. For example, if Lists A and B of
the SSI were averaged together for the score for one ear
and Lists C and D were averaged together for the other
ear, we would expect, based on the present data, that a
10% difference between ears could be related simply to
list differences. If these four lists were used in order
without practice, it could be expected, based on the data
of Figure 1, that an additional 10 to 20% difference between ears would result. Thus, a false diagnosis of CAPD

might be made based on the asymmetrical scores for
this test, which would be due solely to practice effects
and list differences.

Conclusions
1.

Significant practice effects exist for the SSI-ICM test
in young and elderly listeners.

2.

A minimum of one SSI-ICM practice list for young
listeners and three practice lists for the elderly
should be used to reduce practice effects.

3.

Previous studies reporting a high prevalence of
CAPD in the elderly may have been biased due to a
disregard for list or practice effects.

4.

Researchers reporting SSI results should document
whether practice was provided prior to data collection, and if so, how much.

5.

6.

Significant list differences exist for the Auditec of
St. Louis version of the SSI based on differences in
the competing discourse across lists.
It is recommended that Lists A, C, D, E, G, and I of
the Auditec of St. Louis version of the SSI be used if
the test is to compare listening conditions, such as
between ears or across amplification conditions.
Several lists should be averaged to achieve a more
stable test score using the data of Thornton and
Raffin (1978) as a guide.
