ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Visual processing of emotional words modulates early event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the
early posterior negativity (EPN). Questions remain as to whether this modulation reflects modalityspecific processing, preferentially elicited by emotional words of the native language (L1). This
study investigates the modulation of early ERPs during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of
adjectives or nouns referring to emotional feeling states, neutral traits, to an overweight or lean
body or to concrete body parts or neutral objects, presented in the L1 and the second
language (L2). Word ratings in the L2 were assessed in a pilot study. The N100 and the EPN
were modulated by the emotional valence of the stimuli irrespective of the word class or the
task (silent reading vs. word counting). The results suggest that early affective appraisal is
obligatory, not restricted to privileged categories of linguistic information (emotions) or solely
found for the embodied language (L1).

Introduction
There is theoretical consensus, that emotions are primarily physical reactions of the organism that reflect the
basic need of every organism for physical protection
and defense of survival, not only in the non-human
species (e.g. Lang, 1994). Compared to emotions,
human language has emerged only recently in the evolutionary history. Among the different language abilities,
reading, i.e. making meaning from written symbols, is
the most recent language ability developed in human
history. Historically, the occurrence of reading in
humans is too recent for the brain to have underwent
genetic selection during evolution. Nevertheless, brain
damage in the literate brain can cause pure or partial
loss of letter- or word-recognition, phonological or
semantic alexia or pure aphasia. Some language skills
such as reading may reorganise brain functions in a
way that specific neurons or neural networks become
especially attuned to the processing of linguistic features and patterns (Rayner & Reichle, 2010). When
exposed to words, the brains of adult literates do show
changes in neural activity in a number of brain regions
(e.g. Dehaene et al., 2010, 2015). Notably, the functional
changes occurring with reading occur in visual brain

regions belonging to the ventral occipito-temporal
pathway for object recognition (Dehaene et al., 2015).
Therefore, it is legitimate to ask, how reading as well
as the neural and mental processes corresponding to it,
including word recognition and semantic processing,
connect with the basic human brain functions of perceiving, acting, sensing, and feeling during reading. Systematic research into emotional word processing on the
one hand, and on the other hand, shifts in theoretical
thinking, the latter supported among others by embodiment theories (for an overview, e.g. Barsalou et al., 2008;
Kiefer & Pulvermuller, 2012; Kousta et al., 2011) have
paved the way for an in depth discussion of this question, for example by investigating when in the processing stream the emotional meaning of a word is
appraised and at which sequential steps of word- and
information processing, emotional processing might
first occur (e.g. for reviews: Citron, 2012; Kissler et al.,
2006; Scott et al., 2009).
Despite its automaticity in fluent readers, reading is
complex. It involves several stages of processing, such
as the perception, identification, and integration of
orthographic, phonological, and semantic features
(Massaro & Cohen, 1994). Consequently, serial word

processing models assume a sequential and bottom-up
driven processing cascade during which word processing progresses from perceptual to higher-order cognitive processes (for an overview Dien, 2009; Grainger &
Holcomb, 2009). Converging with serial models of
word processing are findings showing that orthographic
processing occurs within the first 250 milliseconds (ms)
after word presentation, lexical and semantic access
occurs around 250 ms after word presentation, and subsequent processing of phonological features occurs
around 250-350 ms (Taylor et al., 2013), and temporally
before semantic integration that occurs at around
400 ms after word presentation in the way required by
the context or the task at hand (for an overview Dien,
2009). In contrast to serial models, parallel word processing models propose that during reading some processes such as lexical and semantic processing might
occur in parallel and that bottom-up and top-down processing can partially overlap, interact and feedback to
earlier processing stages (for an overview, e.g. Pulvermuller et al., 2009). In this view, in certain instances,
semantic processing could occur at the level of visual
word recognition and, therefore, much earlier than
assumed by conventional serial models of visual word
processing (Yap & Seow, 2014).
The early posterior negativity (EPN) is a brain potential
that was first identified by emotional picture processing
studies when emotional and neutral scenes were presented in rapid visual streams of 3 Hz and faster (Junghofer et al., 2001). Consecutive research on the modulation
of this brain potential by non-verbal stimuli suggests that
the EPN can be considered a reliable electrophysiological
marker and indicator of emotional arousal and valence
processing (e.g. for an overview Schupp et al., 2006);
the EPN amplitude modulation peaking for non-verbal
stimuli around 180-280 ms at occipito-parietal electrodes. Research using nearly identical tasks and processing
contexts of rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP at 3 Hz
or 1 Hz, respectively), but emotional words instead of
emotional scenes, showed that the EPN is elicited by
words as well (e.g. Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al.,
2007). For words like for picture stimuli, the EPN is modulated by the emotional content of the stimuli and sensitive to the two emotional dimensions of valence and
arousal (for an overview, e.g. Scott et al., 2009). For
words, the amplitude modulation of the EPN seems to
occur across RSVP studies most robustly in the time
window from 200 to 300 ms after word presentation
(e.g. Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al., 2007).
Since its first discovery, the modulation of the EPN by
emotional words has been investigated repeatedly in a
number of studies systematically varying tasks affordances, word processing speed or the word category.

Until now, the temporal processing of adjectives, nouns,
verbs, or even of first versus third person referential
emotional versus neutral pronoun-noun pairs has been
investigated in several EEG-ERP studies during single
stimulus processing tasks or within a phrase or sentence
context (for an overview e.g. Herbert et al., 2018; Hinojosa
et al., 2020). In addition, the modulation of the EPN by
words was investigated in several studies using lexical
decision tasks or passive viewing tasks such as silent
reading, some of those studies additionally compared
the processing of words versus pseudowords, or words
versus pseudowords versus meaningless pseudowords
derived from emotional versus neutral words (e.g. Hinojosa et al., 2010; Kissler & Herbert, 2013; Schacht &
Sommer, 2009; Sulpizio et al., 2021). Besides some discrepancies in findings, the majority of the studies investigating the modulation of the EPN during silent reading
or during tasks that allow lexico-semantic analysis
support the interpretation that the EPN time window
reflects facilitated lexico-semantic processing of emotional
compared to neutral words in the ventral visual processing
stream (for a discussion, e.g. Kissler et al., 2007). As far as
the facilitated processing of emotional words versus
neutral words as indicated by the EPN is concerned, it
seems, that these processes are invariant to word repetitions across several runs of stimulus presentation
(Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al., 2007) or to changes in
bottom-up driven selective attention modulated by a secondary task such as counting or the attentional blink
(Kissler et al., 2009; Singh & Sunny, 2020). However, EPN
modulation by emotional words has for example not
been found in tasks of merely shallow processing, in
which words can be distinguished solely based on perceptual features (e.g. Hinojosa et al., 2010).
Early facilitated processing of emotional versus
neutral words calls for answers to the question what
makes emotional words special and superior to neutral
words to benefit from early, possibly privileged lexicosemantic processing. Which linguistic dimensions and
which stimulus features of a word including a word's
reference to sensory or motor attributes, and which contextual, probably social and cultural factors, might play a
role? And finally, which processing principles or theoretical framework can explain the effects?
As far as the impact of linguistic dimensions is concerned, the majority of the previous studies have
matched emotional and neutral words for sublexical
(e.g. bigram frequency, orthographic neighbourhood
frequency) or for linguistic dimensions such as the
word frequency or the concreteness/abstractness of
the words. Some studies investigated interaction
effects between the emotionality of a word and the
word frequency or their concreteness/abstractness (e.g.

1386

C. HERBERT

Mendez-Bertolo et al., 2011; Palazova et al., 2013; Sereno
et al., 2020). Word frequency has been found to interact
with the emotional valence or the emotional arousal of a
word at various stages of word processing starting in the
time window of the N100 potential, extending to the
EPN and to later time windows of the P300 or LPP (late
positive potential) (Mendez-Bertolo et al., 2011; Sereno
et al., 2020). For a word's concreteness or abstractness,
recent studies point to temporally rather late interaction
effects between the emotional dimensions and the concreteness/abstractness dimension of a word in the time
window of the late positive potential (LPP), the LPP
sequentially following the EPN by emotion modulation
(Palazova et al., 2013; Pauligk et al., 2019). Thus, it
appears that although the linguistic dimensions are
interacting, neither can linguistic dimensions such as
the word frequency or the abstractness or concreteness
dimensions of a word alone sufficiently explain why
visual processing is boosted by emotional compared to
neutral words in early time windows of word processing,
especially in the time window of the EPN.
Theoretically, there exists no single embodiment
theory. However, embodiment theories share a central
premise in common, namely the grounding of higherorder cognitive processes and abstract concepts in
bodily action and perception. From the view of embodied cognition, conceptual-semantic representations
are distributed across brain networks that link linguistic
concepts with the bodily states but also with the social,
affective, internal states and experiences the concept
refers to (Barsalou, 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2013). Prominent
examples of embodiment theories that particularly
influenced the language faculty are the "Perceptual
Symbol" (PST) and the "Language and Situated Simulation" (LASS) theories, formulated by Barsalou and colleagues (2008). The theories assume that knowledge is
built upon perceptual representations that are stored
as "situated instances", i.e. patterns of brain activation
distributed across the brain's sensory and motor
system (Barsalou et al., 2008). During reading, these perceptual symbols become activated, and by their activation, the reader simulates the experiences he/she
has made during the actual experience and interaction
with the real object the word is referring to. Literally in
the view of embodiment theories, reading a word or sentence means simulating past experience in terms of percepts and actions. In other words, any predication about
the word's meaning during reading is possible only
when the linguistic forms (e.g. orthographic word
form) activate simulations.
Regarding the processing of emotional words, there
is evidence that reading and lexical decisions of
emotional words are associated with changes in

emotional brain regions that do not form part of the
brain's linguistic system, e.g. the amygdala (Herbert
et al., 2009; Kuchinke et al., 2005). Moreover, there is evidence that reading and affective evaluations of
emotional words are accompanied by peripheral-physiological bodily reactions such as changes in facial muscle
activity, heart rate or skin conductance (e.g. Kunecke
et al., 2015; Weis & Herbert, 2017) with some of these
changes (e.g. facial muscle activity) occurring already
very quickly after word presentation (Halberstadt et al.,
2009). Nevertheless, there is still little evidence and
research demonstrating that fast and facilitated visual
processing of emotional versus neutral words is associated with visual modality-preferential embodied processing. For example, in a recent study, reading of facerelated words for whom a strong grounding in perception is expected because these words relate to concrete
features and characteristics of emotionally salient body
parts (e.g. mouth, face, or hand), modulation of the
N170 component was found, a face specific early EEGERP marker preceding the EPN and preferentially triggered by face-related information. This suggests that
visual modality-specific embodied processing of words
occurs earlier than the EPN, but the findings are mixed
(e.g. Fruhholz et al., 2011). Similarly, findings of motor
specific activation have been reported for emotional
action words carrying action features of body parts
with which the emotions can be expressed such as the
face or upper extremities (e.g. Moseley et al., 2012).
Again these effects have been found to occur earlier
than in the time window of the EPN, and, as expected
for modality specific effects, especially over central EEG
sensors covering the motor cortex. Notably, for nonverbal emotional stimuli, sensitivity of the EPN to body
parts has recently been discussed (Farkas et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, viewed from a temporal perspective of
serial word processing, the question persists as to
whether fast and facilitated visual processing of
emotional words, most consistently found across
studies as valence and arousal driven EPN modulation,
is associated with modality-preferential embodied processing. One possibility of answering this question is to
investigate how emotional and neutral words are processed in the native language (L1) versus a second
language (L2), the latter (L2) being learned late in life
and additionally not being the social language of the
reader (i.e. the language used for daily communication).
Theoretically, a later acquisition of a second language
(e.g. at school), especially when L2 is not used for
social interaction may lack the emotional learning
context (for a discussion and overview see e.g. Kuhne
& Gianelli, 2019). Therefore, the words and concepts
learned in L2 may miss the rich and situated emotional

autobiographical experiences, that are usually associated with the native language (L1) and forming the
embodied perceptual simulations and feeling states to
be connected with the word (e.g. for an overview, e.g.
Altarriba & Basnight-Brown, 2012; Caldwell-Harris,
2014; Kuhne & Gianelli, 2019; Pulvermuller, 2018).
A number of previous studies have investigated
language processing in fluent bilinguals, some studies
investigated the processing of emotions in the native
language and the second language. Some studies
point to a processing disadvantage for the second
language (e.g. Chen et al., 2015; Colbeck & Bowers,
2012) and this particularly when investigated in late learners who were not raised as bilinguals but who had
acquired the L2 e.g. at school or later in life (for an overview e.g. Pavlenko, 2008, 2012). However, the suggestion of an emotional detachment hypothesis of the L2
as foreign or second language being less emotional
than L1 (Altarriba, 2008; Dewaele & Pavlenko, 2002)
seems not to be consistently supported by recent EEGERP studies. For example, in a study with GermanSpanish bilinguals, all being late bilinguals, facilitated
processing of emotional words as indicated by the EPN
was observed in both languages during the lexical
decision task (Conrad et al., 2011). The only difference
that was found between the L1 and the L2 respectively
was, that speakers of Spanish, who were currently
living in the country of their L2, did not show preferential processing of negative words. The authors of the
study (Conrad et al., 2011) suggest that their findings
can show that the context in which the language (L2)
is used can impact the processing of emotional concepts
implicitly, which is lending indirect (though not directly
tested) support for a situated embodied acquisition of
emotion concepts in the L2. Akin to this evidence, a
recent EEG-ERP study among late learners found EPN
modulation for emotional compared to neutral words
with no difference between L1 and L2 (Kissler & Bromberek-Dyzman, 2021). Yet another study found a positivity bias in the L1 in the time window of the EPN in late
learners (Chen et al., 2015), whereas in another study,
the processing of emotional words lead to larger EPN
modulation in the L1 and the L2 in German-French
and French-German late bilinguals, with the only difference between the L1 and the L2 in both groups being
reflected by latency measures, i.e. later occurrence of
the EPN effects in the L2 than in the L1 (Opitz &
Degner, 2012).

Aim of the present study
The aim of the present EEG-ERP study is to further
advance and elucidate the time course of emotional

1387

processing, and specifically, the role of the EPN in it.
To this end, previous findings are extended from the
processing of emotional and neutral words to
emotional and neutral words being presented together
with body-related and body-unrelated words in two
different tasks (silent reading vs. shallow perceptual
processing of word counting) and two languages; the
native language (L1) being enriched with embodied
experiences, and the second language (L2), learned
at school, but varying in the frequency with which
the L2 is used by the participants for daily social interaction. The emotional and neutral words in the L1 and
the L2 comprise adjectives related to emotional or
neutral feeling states and traits (sad, anxious, happy,
civilian, etc.). The body-related words comprise body
shape or body weight related adjectives as well as
concrete words (nouns) related to upper or lower
body parts (e.g. eyes, mouth, or arms, vs. legs, feet,
or toes, etc.). The body adjectives describe body
traits related either to a lean body (e.g. thin, athletic,
or sporty) or an overweight body (e.g. corpulent,
bulky, or plump). Although the adjectives related to
a lean or overweight body are no carriers of emotions
per se, such as, for example, emotional adjectives are
that are conveying emotional feelings, the body adjectives chosen in the present study describe body traits
that relate to culturally normed and internalised body
image ideals, that are influenced by societal pressures
and the social media. Traits related to a lean body
portray the admirable ideal body image for women
and men in Western societies (for an overview, e.g.
Thompson & Stice, 2001). An overweight body is
associated with a strong aversion of "being fat" and
implicitly and automatically associated with negative
beliefs about co-occurring traits (e.g. weak-willed,
lazy, or sick). This aversion against "being fat" has
been dubbed the anti-fat bias (Schupp & Renner,
2001). The anti-fat bias might manifest itself in a processing bias for negative body adjectives during
word processing, even in the normal weight population not suffering from eating disorders. Likewise
the longing for an ideal body image might be elicited
specifically by body adjectives related to traits of a
lean body shape and weight. Positive and negative
attitudes towards particular body parts might also be
triggered during reading of concrete body words
(nouns) (face, eyes, mouth, arms, legs, lips, feet, or
toes, etc.). Whether for body adjectives and body
nouns this is like for emotional adjectives reflected
by an early appraisal of the valence or the arousal
intensity of a word in the EPN time window, or
occurs at even earlier word processing stages (e.g.
N100 time window), as could be theoretically

assumed by embodiment theories, or is observed in
the L1 during tasks such as reading or word counting
that allow lexico-semantic access is investigated in the
present study.
In summary, the following still open research questions that were outlined in detail in the Introduction of
this manuscript are investigated:
(1) Is preferential processing of emotional words at
early stages of word processing as for example indicated by the EPN specific to emotional words presented in the L1, or will EPN modulation also occur
for abstract or concrete body shape/weight and
body part related words? If so, do effects occur in
the L1 or the L2 or in both languages?
(2) Will EPN modulation by the emotionality of a word
be temporally the first indicator of facilitated visual
processing of words belonging to different word categories (emotional, body-related, vs. neutral), or will
there be temporally earlier ERP-effects indicative of
modality preferential effects?
(3) Will emotion-driven facilitated processing of words
also occur in the L2 and will it occur across tasks
when the tasks are silent reading or word counting,
the latter attracting attention only to the perceptual
features of the words and not necessarily requiring
semantic processing?
(4) Exploratory: Will the L1-L2 emotion effects be driven
by the use of the second language as a warm and
social language?

Materials and methods
Participants
Thirty-five (N = 35) women (n = 20) and men (n = 15),
all healthy young adults with a mean age of 25.51
years, SD = 4.14, range: 20-35 years, participated in
the study. Inclusion criteria for participation in the
study were, an age of 18 years and older, German
(L1) as native language and English (L2) as the
second language (L2), no history of previous or
current psychiatric, neurological, cardiovascular
or other relevant (pre-) medical conditions, no medication intake or drug use affecting brain activity, corrected-to-normal vision and preferably righthandedness. Participants were recruited via flyers or
email advertisements at the university. Upon arrival
at the laboratory, the participants were debriefed
about the purpose of the study, the inclusion and
exclusion criteria were controlled and the participants
gave oral and written informed consent for voluntary
study participation1.

Sociodemographics and self-reported language
proficiency and questionnaires
After the debriefing and the informed consent, the participants filled in questions addressing their sociodemographic and language background and answered
questions about their language proficiency, acquisition
of the second language, and their use of the second
language as a "social (warm) language". To this end, the
participants were asked to fill in a digital version of the
German Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q; Marian et al., 2007). Moreover, to more
directly access the social warmness of the L2 use, i.e.
the degree to which the participants were using L2 for
their communication with partners, friends and family,
the participants were asked to indicate on a six-point
rating scale (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = occasionally, 4 =
sometimes, 5 = frequently, 6 = always) how often per
day they communicate with their partner or family
members or relatives or friends in English. Higher scores
represent greater frequency. In addition, the participants
filled in the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Bagby et al., 1994;
German version: Bach et al., 1996) and the subscales
"body dissatisfaction" and "drive for thinness" of the
Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2; German version: Thiel
et al., 1997). Alexithymia is a personality trait characterised by difficulties in identifying and describing one's
feelings, and is further characterised by a focus on externally oriented thinking versus insight into own feelings
and appraisal of internal feelings (Taylor & Bagby, 2000).
Accordingly, alexithymia was controlled in the present
study because individuals scoring high on this personality trait might have difficulties in "embodying" the
words they read. It is estimated that 10% of the general
population are suffering from alexithymia with even
higher prevalence in individuals at risk or suffering from
mental health conditions (Ricciardi et al., 2015). Body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness are strong predictors of
risk of eating disorders, specifically in women (Stice et al.,
2011). Therefore, these two dimensions and scales of the
EDI-2 questionnaire were included to control for individual differences in the extent to which body image ideals
and social norms including anti-fat biases are internalised. The results of the sociodemographic data, language
proficiency and language use are presented in the
Results.

SAM scales ranged from 1 (very unpleasant, calm) to 9 (very pleasant, very arousing). Word length (number of letters), word frequency values were taken from
the Leipzig Corpora Collection (Goldhahn et al., 2012). Same superscripts a,b, or c indicate no significant differences; different superscripts, a,b, or c indicate
significant differences between the word categories. Means and standard deviations (SD).

1 Hz (1000 ms word duration) was chosen to avoid post
perceptual inhibition or potential ERP component overlaps. In total, a set of 144 German (L1) words and 144
English (L2) words were presented (288 words in total).
The German words consisted of 20 positive, 20 negative
and 20 neutral adjectives, 30 body shape and weight
related adjectives (n = 15 related to a lean shape, n =
15 related to an overweight shape), and 36 body part
related nouns (18 related to the upper body, 18 to the
lower body) and 18 neutral nouns related to concrete
objects (e.g. chair, fork, desk, etc.). The English L2
words were created from translations of the L1
German words and thus, the best semantic match of
the German words. As illustrated in the Tables 1-6,
word length and word frequency were controlled for
all the words in both languages. Word frequency
scores were taken from available normative databases
including the Leipzig Corpora for German words
(Biemann et al., 2007) and the Subtlex word data base
for English words (Brysbaert et al., 2019). In addition,
the German emotional and neutral adjectives were
matched and controlled for emotional valence and
arousal using the normative ratings available from previous studies (e.g. Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al.,
2009) that included a list of about 500 German trait
and state adjectives for which subjective ratings of
valence and arousal were acquired from 45 female and
male student subjects (mean age: 25.7 years) on the
Self Assessment Manikin, SAM, 9-point scales (Bradley
& Lang, 1994). In addition, valence and arousal ratings

were available for the German neutral and bodyrelated nouns from the ratings taken from previous
studies (Herbert et al., 2013) including a list of 86 body
nouns for which in previous studies (e.g. Herbert et al.,
2013) subjective ratings of valence and arousal were
acquired on the SAM on 9-point scales from a normative
sample of 60 women (mean age: 23.5 years, SD = 5.59)
and 37 men (mean age: 24.81 years, SD = 6.26). The
body nouns were matched with neutral nouns that
were taken from a list of 300 nouns for which normative
subjective ratings of valence and arousal were acquired
on the SAM on 9-point scales in previous studies from
study samples (N = 45 student volunteers) with a social
background and age comparable to the present study
samples (e.g. Kissler et al., 2007). Because, no normative
ratings are available for the German body adjectives and
the L2 translations, a pilot study was conducted. In this
pilot study, all the translated German L2 words as well
as the German L1 body trait adjectives (for which no
valence and arousal ratings were available from previous
studies or databases) were rated in an online study by N
= 208 healthy adults (women and men) for valence and
arousal. Language proficiency of the L2 (English) and age
of acquisition of the L2 (English) were controlled among
the participants of the pilot study to achieve comparability with the participants taking part in the EEG study. The
N = 208 participants (n = 62 men) of the online study
were all native speakers of German with high language
proficiency of the English language, n = 14 reporting
fluency of a mother tongue, n = 67 reporting business

status and n = 86 reporting fluent use, and n = 41 reporting good knowledge at a level learnt at school. They
were asked to rate the L2 words and the L1 body
shape/weight adjectives for emotional valence and
arousal. In the online study, each word was presented
on a separate frame to avoid carry over effects. The
SAM, Self-Assessment Manikin (Bradley & Lang, 1994)
was used for the ratings to assess affective judgments
rather than judgments of semantic valence. The instructions of the ratings followed the rating instructions of
Bradley and Lang (1994) to allow comparison of the
ratings with the ratings reported for the German L1
words that were taken from databases used in previous
studies (see above). The results of the pilot study are
presented in the Results and summarised together
with the descriptive data (ratings for the L1 words) in
the Tables 1-6.
During the EEG study, the full set of words (German,
L1 and English, L2) comprising the adjectives and the
nouns was presented repeatedly in 12 random blocks,

6 blocks per language. Each block lasted about 2.5 min
and contained the full list of words of one language.
Within the blocks, word order was randomised. In
addition, the order of the blocks (L1 vs. L2) was randomised across the participants. The first two blocks presented in each language were related to passive
reading and were followed by two "active" blocks
during which participants had to count the words
written in red or green versus black colour (shallow
word encoding task of word counting). The active
blocks were then followed by a final passive reading
block and a final word counting block. Figure 1 provides
a graphical illustration of the experimental stimulus
presentation design.
The stimuli were presented on a computer screen in a
sound and light attenuated cabin using Presentation
software (https://www.neurobs.com/). In the passive
reading blocks the stimuli were presented in black
letters on grey background (font: 90, Arial). In the
active word counting blocks, half of the stimuli were

presented in red and green colour (the "to be counted"
words) or black colour. The participants' tasks were to
read the words silently (silent reading task, 3 blocks
per language) or to count the words written in red or
green versus black colour (shallow word encoding task
of word counting, 3 blocks per language). Between
each of the passive and active stimulus presentation
blocks, a break was included and a free recall memory
test was performed in which the participants had to
write down as many of the words they could remember
in the serial order the words came to their mind.
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was continuously
recorded from 64 electrodes across all RSVP blocks.
The topography of the 64 EEG electrodes was in
accord with the 10-20 system of electrode location
and electrode placement. Active electrodes were used
for EEG recordings to achieve high signal to noise
quality (SNR). In addition, vertical and horizontal eye
movements as well as blinks were recorded via the electrooculogram (EOG) from additional EEG electrodes
attached to the left canthus and the right canthus and
the left upper and lower eye regions.

The participants' specific language competence of
the words presented in L2 was assessed by means of a
vocabulary test. The vocabulary test was carried out
after the main EEG experiment and intended to test
word proficiency, comprehension and familiarity with
the English words used in the study. To this end, in the
vocabulary test, the participants were asked to translate
the English words into German. They received an excel
sheet with all English words randomly presented in a
row and had to type in the German translation of the
word. Participants were asked to decide for the best
matching translation and write down the best match.
Synonyms and obvious typing errors were counted as
correct. A maximum of 100% could be achieved in the
vocabulary task corresponding to a correct translation
of all the words.
Finally, a manipulation check was performed: the participants were asked to rate the word categories for selfreference, i.e. the degree to which they had related the
words presented in the L1 or the L2 to themselves
during the EEG study. Participants had to indicate their
answer on 9-point Likert scales ranging from 1 = no

self-reference to 9, high self-reference. Finally, they were
asked about "felt emotions" they might have experienced during word processing and to name the word
categories that elicited emotional feelings or experiences. The results of the vocabulary test, the memory
performance and the ratings of the manipulation
check are presented in the Results.

Data analysis and statistics
The EEG and the EOG data were recorded with Brain
Vision amplifiers (https://brainvision.com/) and Brain
Vision recording software (https://brainvision.com/).
The EEG and the EOG data were sampled at 1000 Hz.
The preprocessing of the EEG and the EOG data followed
offline and was performed with Brain Vision 2.1. Analyzer
software (https://brainvision.com/). Offline, the data was
filtered from 0.5 to 70 Hz, eye movements were corrected by the automated Gratton and Coles algorithm
implemented in the Brain Vision 2.1. Analyzer software
and the data were visually inspected for movement
and other artifacts. The epoched data was re-referenced
from an FCz reference (online) to an average reference
offline, using all 64 EEG sensors without EOG electrodes
for the average reference. The artifact-free EEG data
were segmented into epochs starting from -1000 ms
before until 1000 ms after word presentation and the
-1000 ms to 0 ms epoch was used for baseline correction in line with previous EEG-RSVP studies (e.g.
Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al., 2007). The baseline corrected EEG epochs were averaged separately for each
word category, block and language (L1 vs. L2, respectively). Across the word categories, early event-related
brain potentials (ERPs) were analysed in three different
time intervals. The EEG-ERP time intervals corresponded
to the P100 (80-120 ms), N100 (140-170), and the EPN
(200-300 ms). The time intervals were selected in line
with the literature including previous RSVP word processing studies (e.g. Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al., 2007)
and by visual inspections of the ERP grand average
waveforms. Moreover, and in line with these previous
studies, the analysis of the amplitudes of the P100 (80-
120 ms), the N100 (140-170 ms), and the EPN (200-
300 ms) components was performed on a cluster-level
including the occipito-parietal electrode cluster O1,
PO7, PO3, and P7 as left hemisphere cluster and the occipito-parietal electrode cluster O2, PO8, PO4, and P8 as
right hemisphere cluster. The averaged amplitudes of
the electrodes of the left or the right hemisphere clusters
in the respective time windows were included into the
statistical analysis of the P100, the N100, and the EPN,
respectively. The data of N = 1 participant had to be
excluded from the analysis due to a missing last block

in the EEG data, yielding finally a dataset of N = 34 participants for statistical analysis.
The modulation of the ERP amplitudes by the
different word categories was statistically analysed separately for each of the ERP components (P1, N1, and EPN,
respectively) within repeated measures of variance
(ANOVAs). First, emotion effects were compared
between the two languages (L1 vs. L2) and between
the passive blocks of reading versus the active blocks
of word counting, using emotional and neutral adjectives as word category only. The ANOVA designs of the
P100, the N100 and the EPN included the following
within-subject factors: the factor "emotion" (positive,
negative, and neutral), "task" (passive vs. active)
"language" (L1 vs. L2) and "hemisphere" (left, right).
Second, the body-related adjectives and the bodyrelated nouns were compared to the categories of
neutral adjectives or neutral nouns. For the bodyrelated adjectives, the ANOVA designs included the following factors: the factor "body shape/weight" (lean
body shape, overweight body shape, neutral adjectives
having no body reference), "task" (passive vs. active),
"language" (L1 vs. L2) and "hemisphere" (left, right).
For the body part nouns, the ANOVA designs included
the following factors: the factor "body part" (upper
body part, lower body part, and neutral nouns having
no body reference), "task" (passive vs. active), "language"
(L1 vs. L2) and "hemisphere" (left, right). If the sphericity
assumption was violated in the ANOVA designs, the pvalues were corrected according to the Huynh-Feldt procedure. Degrees of freedom are reported uncorrected.
Partial eta2-squared is reported to describe effect sizes
(Cohen, 1988). Significant main effects or interaction
effects were explored by means of planned comparison
tests comparing only those contrasts that were relevant
for hypothesis testing, thereby avoiding unnecessary
multiple testing. P-values are reported uncorrected (significance level: p < .05)

Sociodemographic data, manipulation check and
memory performance
The sociodemographic variables and the answers to the
questions asking for language proficiency, language use
as well as the data of the participants' ratings of the
emotionality and self-reference of the words (manipulation check) are reported descriptively. In addition,
exploratory analysis were conducted to determine if
the EEG-ERP modulation patterns varied as a function
of the social language use of the second language (L2).
To this end, ERP modulation was correlated with the
scores obtained from the self-report scale "social
language use" using Pearson correlation and two sided

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

testing. Additionally, two groups of participants were
selected based on high versus low scores on the scale
asking for social language use. This grouping factor
"social L2 use" was then used as between subject
factor in the repeated measures ANOVA designs. The
exploratory analysis was performed only if in the analysis
described above, the factor "emotion", "body shape/
weight" or "body part" showed a significant interaction
with the factor language (L1 vs. L2). Then, it was
explored whether the interaction was dependent on
the participants' variation in the L2 language use as a
"warm" or "distant" L2. The participants' memory data
could be analysed only for the participants who provided free recall data across all blocks and in good
type writing (n = 11). The correctly recalled words
("hits") were analysed and statistically compared
between the L1 and the L2 and across word categories
by means of non-parametric tests.

Pilot study: affective ratings of the words in L2
and ratings in L1
The affective ratings (mean scores) of valence and
arousal in the L2 including the emotional and the
neutral adjectives, the body shape/weight related adjectives, the nouns related to body parts or neutral objects
as well as the body shape/weight related adjectives in
the L1 that were rated from the N = 208 participants of
the pilot study were statistically analysed within
ANOVA designs using the factor "word category" as
within-subject grouping factor; significant effects
between the word categories were tested further by
means of post-hoc tests using t-tests.
The affective ratings (mean scores) of valence and
arousal of the German words (L1) (see Tables 1 and 2)
that were taken from the available ratings of the word
lists used in the previous studies (see for details the
section Stimuli and experimental study design) as well as
the scores for word frequency that were taken from standardised corpora (see for details the section Stimuli and
experimental study design) and word length were tested
for significant differences between the words of the
different word categories by using non-parametric tests,
where appropriate. P-values are reported uncorrected.

EEG-ERP data
Emotion effects: processing of emotional versus
neutral trait and state adjectives
P100. The amplitude modulation of the P100 showed
the following significant main and interaction effects:

1393

the main factor "task" was significant, F(1,33) = 26.47, p
< .001, eta2 = .445, MQ = 51.31. The P100 amplitudes
were significantly more pronounced during the
shallow encoding task of active counting in which
words were presented in three different colours than
during silent reading where all words were presented
in black colour, F(1,33) = 26.46, p = .00012, MQ = 51.31.
No other main factor was significant (all p > .05). The
interaction effect of "task x language" was significant, F
(1,33) = 4.76, p < .036, eta2 = .126, MQ = 7.04. The task
effect, showing larger P100 amplitudes during active
counting than during silent reading, was significantly
more pronounced in the L1 than in the L2, F(1,33) =
34.231, p = .0001, MQ = 48.19. No other main effects or
interaction effects reached significance (all p > .05).

N100. The N100 amplitudes were significantly modulated by the main factor "task", F(1,33) = 10.59, p = .003,
eta2 = .243, MQ = 41.79. The amplitudes of the N100
were significantly larger during active counting than
during silent reading, F(1,33) = 10.584, p = .002, MQ =
41.79. In addition, the N100 amplitudes were modulated
by the main factor "emotion", F(2,66) = 3.167, p = .053,
eta2 = .088, MQ = 5.50. The N100 amplitudes were significantly larger during the processing of positive adjectives than during the processing of neutral adjectives, F
(1,33) = 9.66, p = .003, MQ = 10.83. The main effect of
emotion was accompanied by a significant interaction
effect of "emotion x language x hemisphere", F(2,66) =
5.86, p = .008, eta2 = .151, MQ = 1.60. The modulation
of the amplitudes of the N100 by positive adjectives
was found in the left and the right hemisphere in the
L1 (left hemisphere: positive vs. neutral: F(1,33) = 4.20,
p = .048, MQ = 1.74; positive vs. negative: F(1,33) =
12.16, p = .001, MQ = 4.93; right hemisphere: positive
vs. neutral: F(1,33) = 4.57, p = .040, MQ = 1.73). In the
L2, the N100 amplitudes were significantly more pronounced during the processing of negative and positive
adjectives compared to neutral adjectives in the left
hemisphere (left hemisphere: positive vs. neutral: F
(1,33) = 7.17, p = .011, MQ = 3.85, negative vs. neutral: F
(1,33) = 5.86, p = .02, MQ = 12.64) and during the processing of positive compared to neutral adjectives in the
right hemisphere (right hemisphere: positive vs.
neutral: F(1,33) = 5.57, p = .024, MQ = 3.93). No other
main effects or interaction effects reached significance
in the N100 time window (all p > .05).
EPN. The amplitudes of the EPN were significantly modulated by the main effects of "task", F(1,33) = 6.46, p = .016,
eta2 = .164, MQ = 28.68, "emotion", F(2,66) = 6.01,
p = .015, eta2 = .154, MQ = 15.56, and "hemisphere",
F(1,33) = 5.61, p = .024, eta2 = .148, MQ = 24.45. In

1394

C. HERBERT

addition, the following interaction effects were significant: "language x hemisphere", F(1,33) = 4.21, p = .048,
MQ = 1.06, eta2 = .113, and "emotion x language",
F(2,66) = 3.82, p = .054, eta2 = .104, MQ = 10.11. No other
main effects or interaction effects reached significance
in the EPN time window (all p > .05). The amplitudes of
the EPN were significantly more pronounced during
active counting than during silent reading, F(1,33) =
6.46, p = .0158, MQ = 28.67, and more pronounced in the
left hemisphere electrode cluster compared to the right
hemisphere electrode cluster, F(1,33) = 5.61, p = .023,
MQ = 24.45. This was further modulated by the language:
for the L1, the EPN amplitudes were more pronounced in
the left hemisphere cluster compared to the right hemisphere cluster, F(1,33) = 7.10, p = .01, MQ = 17.86,
whereas in the L2, the size of the EPN amplitudes did
not differ significantly between the left and right hemisphere. Moreover, the amplitudes of the EPN were significantly more pronounced during the processing of positive
or negative adjectives than during the processing of
neutral adjectives (positive vs. neutral: F(1,33) = 11.08, p
= .002, MQ = 4.90; negative vs. neutral: F(1,33) = 7.58,
p = .01, MQ = 30.70), irrespective of the task or the hemisphere and the emotion effect was modulated by the
language. The processing of the positive adjectives as
well as of the negative adjectives elicited significantly
larger EPN amplitudes than neutral adjectives when
words were presented in the L2 (positive vs. neutral:
F(1,33) = 14.63, p = .001, MQ = 5.45; negative vs. neutral:
F(1,33) = 6.55, p = .01, MQ = 48.64).

Processing of body-shape/weight related
adjectives versus neutral adjectives and of body
nouns versus neutral nouns
P100. Comparisons between the body shape/weight
related adjectives and the neutral adjectives yielded a
significant main effect the factor "task", F(1,33) = 52.38,
p = .000, eta2 = .618, MQ = 66.43. In addition, the interaction between the factors "body shape/weight" x "
hemisphere" x "task" was significant, F(2,66) = 4.13,
p = .02, eta2 = .278, MQ = 1.82. The P100 amplitudes
were more pronounced during active counting than
during silent reading, F(1,33) = 52.39, p = .001. In
addition, the processing of the body shape/weight
adjectives related to a lean body elicited larger P100
amplitudes than the processing of neutral adjectives in
the right hemisphere electrode cluster when the words
had to be counted, F(1,33) = 6.26, p = .017, MQ = 6.19.
For the body nouns that were related to upper or
lower body parts and the neutral nouns, the P100 modulation showed a main effect of "task", F(1,33) = 63.43,
p < .0001, eta2 = .658, MQ = 56.13. No other effects
were significant. The P100 amplitudes were more

pronounced during active counting than during
passive reading, F(1,33) = 63.43, p < .0001, MQ = 56.13.

N100. In the N100 time window, the main effect of
"task", F(1,33) = 6.74, p = .014, eta2 = .170, MQ = 14.41,
as well as the main effect of "language", F(1,33) =
10.72, p = .002, eta2 = .245, MQ = 7.90, were significant.
The amplitude modulation of the N100 was significantly
larger during active counting than during silent reading,
F(1,33) = 6.74, p = .001, MQ = 14.41 as well as during the
processing of the body adjectives and the neutral adjectives in the L1 compared to the L2, F(1,33) = 10.72,
p = .003, MQ = 7.90. The latter effect (L1 vs. L2) was significantly more pronounced in the left than in the right
hemisphere; this was indicated by the significant interaction between the factors "language" x "hemisphere",
F(1,33) = 9.71, p = .004, eta2 = .227, MQ = 2.07. In
addition, the interaction between the factors "body
shape/weight" x "hemisphere", F(1,33) = 8.58, p = .0000,
eta2 = .206, MQ = 3.11, was significant. The N100 amplitudes were more pronounced in the left hemisphere
during the processing of body adjectives related to an
overweight body shape/weight compared to
the neutral adjectives, irrespective of the task or
the language in which the words were presented,
F(1,33) = 5.51, p = .024, MQ = 9.95.
The N100 modulation did not differ significantly
between the body nouns and the neutral nouns. Only
the factor "language", F(1,33) = 10.29, p = .003, eta2
= .238, MQ = 10.52, showed a significant impact on the
modulation of the amplitudes of the N100 during the
processing of nouns related to body parts versus
neutral nouns. The amplitude modulation of the N100
was more pronounced during the processing of the
body nouns and the neutral nouns presented in the L1
than in the L2, F(1,33) = 10.28, p = .003, MQ = 10.28.
EPN. In the EPN time window, the processing of the
body-shape/weight related adjectives and the neutral
adjectives showed the following main and interaction
effects: there was a main effect of "language",
F(1,33) = 6.86, p = .013, eta2 = .172, MQ = 5.26, and a
main effect of "hemisphere", F(1,33) = 4.05, p = .052,
eta2 = .109, MQ = 33.10, and a main effect of "body
shape/weight", F(1,33) = 10.35, p = .001, eta2 = .239,
MQ = 6.65, as well as a significant interaction effect of
the factors "language" x "hemisphere", F(2,66) = 13.50,
p = .001, eta2 = .290, MQ = 2.30. The EPN amplitudes
were more pronounced during the processing of the
body adjectives and the neutral adjectives when these
were presented in the native language (L1) than in the
L2, F(1,33) = 6.86, p = .0132, MQ = 5.25. Moreover, the
amplitudes of the EPN were significantly more

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

pronounced during the processing of the body shape/
weight adjectives related to a lean or overweight body
than during the processing of the neutral words that
were having no reference to body weight/shape ((lean
and overweight) versus neutral: F(1,33) = 9.51, p = .004,
MQ = 6.51), and this effect occurred irrespective of the
hemisphere (left vs. right) or the language (L1 or L2,
respectively) in which the words had been presented
or the task at hand, although irrespective of the word
category, the EPN amplitudes were larger in the left
than the right hemisphere in the L1 than in the L2, F
(1,33) = 8.58, p = .006, MQ = 3.40.
During the processing of the body nouns and the
neutral nouns, the amplitudes of the EPN were significantly modulated by the factor "language", F(1,33) =
4.88, p = .034, eta2 = .129, MQ = 6.20, and the factor
"hemisphere", F(1,33) = 7.52, p = .010, eta2 = .185, MQ
= 33.57. In addition, the effect of "language" showed
an interaction with the factor "hemisphere", F(1,33) =
12.04, p = .001, eta2 = .267, MQ = 12.04. Moreover, the
processing of the body nouns and of the neutral
nouns differed significantly between the right and
the left hemisphere; this was indicated by the interaction effect of the factors "body parts" x "hemisphere",
F(2,66) = 6.35, p = .003, eta2 = .101, MQ = 6.35. This
interaction effect was further modulated by the factor
"language"; this was indicated by the significant interaction of the factors "body parts" x "hemisphere" x "
language", F(2,66) = 6.66, p = .002, eta2 = .168, MQ =
6.66. Nouns in general elicited larger EPN amplitudes
when presented in the L2 than when presented in
the L1, F(1,33) = 4.88, p = .034, MQ = 6.20, particularly
in the left compared the right posterior hemisphere,
F(1,33) = 4.31, p = .045, MQ = 10.02. However, the processing of the body nouns, that is, the nouns that
are related to upper or lower body parts, elicited significantly larger amplitude modulation of the EPN
than the processing of the neutral nouns; and this
was significant only in the electrode cluster of the
left hemisphere and most pronounced for the nouns
that were presented in the L1, F(1,33) = 5.28, p = .028,
MQ = .831.

Exploratory analysis
EEG-ERP modulation by word categories as a
function of social language use
Correlation analysis revealed significant interactions
between the modulation of the ERPs and the extent
to which the participants reported to use the L2 as a
warm language for daily social interaction. Significant
correlations (p < .05) were found in the EPN time
window for the negative adjectives of the second

1395

language (L2). In addition, the modulation of the
N100 by the emotional adjectives in the L1 and the
L2 was varying with the between group factor "social
L2 use"; and this was indicated by a significant interaction of the group factor with the factors "emotion" x
"hemisphere", F(64,2) = 3.188, p = .048, eta2 = .091, MQ
= 1.11: the modulation of the N100 amplitudes elicited
by the positive adjectives compared to the neutral
adjectives in the left as well as in the right hemisphere
was specifically observed in the group of participants
(n = 20) who used the L2 as a warm language (all p
< .058). The ERP effects elicited during the processing
of the different word categories are summarised in
Figure 2.

Sociodemographics: language proficiency and
language use
Vocabulary test
Overall, the performance in the vocabulary test was
high. In total, on average 80% of the English words irrespective of the word category (emotional, neutral, bodyrelated) or word class (nouns, adjectives) were correctly
translated by the participants.
Language use (L2)
In line with the performance in the vocabulary test,
82.8% of the participants (N = 29) rated their language
proficiency as very good (business fluent) or good
(fluent). In terms of the frequency of language use,
English was reported to be spoken predominantly
abroad (holiday, vacation) and in a university context.
41.2% of the participants reported speaking English
frequently in this context, 47.1% reported speaking it
sometimes, and 11.4% of the participants reported
speaking English barely at all. Regarding the use
of English as a social language, 17.1% of the participants reported to use English frequently in everyday
interaction (e.g. interacting with friends, family,
school, work, study, social interaction, etc.), and
28.6% of the participants reported to use it frequently,
whereas 45.7% (N = 16) and 5.7% (N = 2) reported to
barely or not use English as L2 for social interaction
at all.

After the experiment, the participants were asked to
report which of the word categories had elicited feelings
of emotions during the EEG word processing experiment. Of all possible word categories, the emotional

adjectives and the adjectives related to body weight/
shape were reported most consistently to have elicited
emotional experiences followed by the nouns related
to body parts, whereas neutral adjective or neutral
nouns were never reported (0%) to having elicited feelings of emotion or emotional experiences, respectively
during the experiment. When asked to indicate on a 9point Likert scale whether the participants had related
the words to themselves during processing, self-referential ratings showed the highest scores of self-reference

for the positive trait and state adjectives presented in
the L1 (M = 6.13, SD = 1.73), for the adjectives related
to body weight/shape presented in L1 (M = 5.88, SD =
2.55), irrespective of a lean or overweight body shape,
and for the positive adjectives presented in L2 (M =
5.65, SD = 1.93). All other word categories did not differ
significantly from each other in self-reference ratings,
achieving mean scores between 4 and 5 on the Likert
scale (neither being rated high or low in self-reference),
irrespective of the language (L1 or L2) in which they

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

were presented. The neutral word categories (adjectives
or nouns) were on average rated as not inducing selfreferentiality (self-reference scores ranging below a
score of 3) in both languages.

Memory
On average, only a few words were remembered (see
Figure 3); and this is typical for free recall tasks (e.g.
see Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al., 2007). Descriptively, different words were remembered in the L1
and the L2 across the blocks suggesting that participants had followed the instructions and only little
carry over effects from one language to the other
were elicited, possibly also due to the randomisation
of the block order. Statistical analysis showed that
overall, memory did not differ between the L1 and
the L2, but that words from the different word categories were differently well remembered (FriedmansANOVA Chi (15) = 32.26, p = .006). Post-hoc tests (Wilcoxon tests) showed that the positive emotional adjectives were remembered better than the neutral
adjectives in the L1 (Z = 2.091, p = .037) and the L2 (Z
= 2.371, p = .018). The body shape/weight adjectives
related to an overweight body size/shape were remembered better than the neutral adjectives in the L1 (Z =
2.312, p = .02) and in the L2 (Z = 1.937, p = .052). Nouns
referring to lower body parts were remembered better
than the neutral nouns in the L1 (Z = 2.001, p = .045).
For an overview, see Figure 3.

Self-report data (Questionnaires)
Difficulties in emotion processing (alexithymia)
On average, the participants of the study sample scored
below the critical cut off score of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale that differentiates between high (cut-off >
61), possible (cut-off between 52 and 56) and low alexithymia (cut-off equal or less than 52), M = 39.57, SD =
8.45. The range of the sum scores was between 22 and
56, and only N = 3 participants had a sum score indicating possible alexithymia (Ricciardi et al., 2015).
Body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness
On average, the mean sum scores of the EDI-2 body dissatisfaction scale (M = 28.23, SD = 3.94) and the drive for
thinness scale (M = 18.74, SD = 5.63) of this mixed
gender participant sample were below the mean sum
scores of clinical samples reporting a risk or clinical diagnosis of an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa or
bulimia (e.g. Clausen et al., 2009).

Pilot study: affective ratings of the words in L2
and L1 ratings
Statistical analysis including all word categories of the
pilot study including all words translated to English
(L2) as well as the German (L1) body adjectives yielded
significant main effects of the factors "valence", F(1863,9) = 509.81, p = .001, eta2 = .771, and "arousal", F

(1863,9) = 224.92, p = .001, eta2 = .521. T-tests revealed
significant differences (see Tables 4-6): the emotional
(positive/negative) adjectives received the highest or
the lowest valence scores, respectively (Table 4). The
participants of the pilot study rated the positive
emotional adjectives higher in valence than the neutral
adjectives, t(207) = 30.01, p < .001, or the negative
emotional adjectives, t(207) = 35.39, p < .001, and they
rated the negative emotional adjectives lower in
valence than the neutral adjectives, t(207) = 30.01, p
< .001. The adjectives referring to a lean body shape
(Table 6) received significantly higher valence scores
than the neutral adjectives, t(207) = 9.14, p < .001. The
nouns referring to upper body parts (Table 5) were
rated significantly higher in valence than the neutral
nouns, t(207) = 7.51, p < .001. The body adjectives referring to a lean body shape were rated significantly lower
in valence than the positive emotional adjectives, but
higher in valence than the negative emotional adjectives
(both p < .001). Furthermore, the participants of the pilot
study rated the adjectives referring to an overweight
body shape (Table 6) as significantly lower in valence

than the neutral adjectives, t(207) = -77.18, p < .001
(Table 4), and the nouns referring to lower body parts
(Table 5) as significantly lower in valence than the
neutral nouns, t(207) = -7.75, p < .001 (Table 5).
However, body adjectives or body nouns were not
rated as high in valence (pleasantness) or as low in
valence (unpleasantness) as were the positive or the
negative adjectives, see Tables 4-6 for an overview. As
shown in Table 4, the positive and the negative adjectives received the highest arousal scores: the arousal
ratings of the positive and the negative adjectives
were both significantly higher compared to neutral
adjectives, t(207) = 9.15, and t(207) = 11.49, both p
< .001 (Table 4). Additionally, the adjectives referring to
a lean or overweight body shape received significantly
higher arousal scores than the neutral adjectives, both,
p < .001, (Tables 4 and 6). The nouns referring to upper
or lower body parts were rated higher in arousal than
the neutral nouns, t(207) = 21.28 or t(207) = 21.11, both
p < .001, (Table 6). The body adjectives referring to a
lean or overweight body shape in the L2 were not
rated differently in arousal within the language (L2)

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

1399

Figure 2. Continued.

and were not rated differently in arousal or valence
compared to the body adjectives presented in L1 (all
p > .06), however, the body nouns or the body adjectives
were rated lower in arousal compared to the emotional
adjectives, and in both languages did not achieve the
same high scores of unpleasantness/pleasantness
(valence) as the emotional adjectives, see Tables 4-6
for the L2 words and Tables 1-3 for the L1 words. Moreover, as shown in Tables 1-6, the word categories did
not differ significantly in word length in the German
language (L1), (Kruskal-Wallis: H(7) = 9.51, p = .22), nor
in the English language (L2), (Kruskal-Wallis: H(7) =
11.71, p = .12). Word frequency scores differed significantly across the word categories in L1 (Kruskal-Wallis:
H(7) = 16.65, p = .02), however, as revealed by post-hoc
multiple comparison tests, word frequency did not
differ between the word categories of body nouns
versus neutral nouns, or the emotional and neutral
adjectives, or the body adjectives (lean vs. overweight
body shape), all p > .05, because these word categories
were matched in terms of word frequency. In the
English language L2, the word frequency counts

(SUBTLEX, Freqcount) differed across the word categories as well (Kruskal-Wallis: H(7) = 14.06, p < .001).
Post-hoc multiple comparison tests showed no significant differences between the word categories of body
nouns versus neutral nouns, or between the emotional
adjectives, or between the body adjectives (lean vs.
overweight body shape), all p > .05. However, the body
nouns referring to upper body parts and lower body
parts differed in word frequency (T = -31.83, p = .022).
The German words (L1) differed significantly in terms
of emotional valence, H(5) = 81.71, p < .001, and
emotional arousal, H(5) = 68.08, p < .001: the positive
adjectives, Z = 5.26, p < .001, and the negative adjectives,
Z = 4.80, p < .001, scored significantly higher in
emotional arousal than the neutral adjectives according
to the rating data provided in previous emotional word
processing studies in the German language. Furthermore, and in accord with previous studies, the positive
adjectives had on average significantly higher emotional
valence ratings than the negative adjectives, Z = 4.86, p
< .001, or the neutral adjectives, Z = 4.85, p < .001,
whereas the negative adjectives had on average

significantly lower emotional valence ratings than the
positive or the neutral adjectives, Z = -5.40, p < .001,

This EEG-ERP study investigated the modulation of early
ERP components elicited during processing of emotional
and body-related and neutral words to examine whether
modulation of the EPN is the ERP that is showing temporally earliest differential processing effects elicited
by words belonging to different semantic word categories and word classes (adjectives vs. nouns) carrying
explicit versus implicit emotional meaning. The study
and its results add to the ongoing discussion of
whether early emotion effects as observed in previous
EEG-ERP studies, are, when conveyed by symbols such
as words, electrophysiological emotion indicators.
Embodiment theories have proposed a relationship
between word processing, perceptual, motor and
affective processing in the brain. More specifically, two
different modes of processing linguistic information
have been theoretically proposed. Linguistic processing
based on modality independent processing and linguistic processing based on embodied and modality-

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

dependent simulations (e.g. Barsalou et al., 2008). The
current study and its result can contribute to this discussion about the function and driving factors of early ERP
emotion effects in word processing by investigating
whether modulation of early ERPs, specifically of the
EPN, is specific to words of emotional content or
observed for other word categories such as bodyweight/shape and body-part related words as well and
specially when presented in the native or the second
language. Crucially, in contrast to emotional words,
body-weight/shape or body part related words do not
possess emotional content per se, nor do they explicitly
refer to any emotional content or feelings as do
emotional words. However, specifically, body-weight/
shape related words might obtain emotionality from
shared socio-cultural norms, selectively promoting a
lean body image, and in conjunct with this, an aversion
against overweight body shapes. If so, it was investigated if such emotionality effects will occur during the
processing of body adjectives referring to a lean or overweight body shape or nouns referring to concrete body
parts and if such effects will be observed in the second
language too, across tasks comprising passive reading
or shallow word encoding (word counting), respectively.

Time course of emotional versus neutral word
processing in L1 and L2
Modulation of the EPN amplitudes averaged across left
and right parieto-occipital electrode clusters showed a
significant main effect of "emotion". Consistent with
many findings reported in previous studies (e.g.
Herbert et al., 2008; Kissler et al., 2009), the processing
of emotional adjectives elicited significantly larger EPN
amplitudes than the processing of neutral adjectives.
Interestingly, this emotion effect occurred irrespective
of task (silent reading or word counting), but not irrespective of the language in which the words were presented. The EPN amplitudes were more pronounced
during active word counting than during silent reading
supporting an influence of the factor "task" that was,
however, independent from the EPN emotion effect.
Moreover, the EPN modulation was more pronounced
for the adjectives presented in the L1 compared to the
L2 in the left hemisphere cluster. However, the EPN
emotion effect (larger EPN amplitudes for emotional
than neutral adjectives) was significantly modulated by
the factor "language" irrespective of the task or the
hemisphere and generally, significantly more pronounced in the L2 and for emotional adjectives compared to neutral adjectives.
The EPN effect observed in the present study cannot
be explained by differences in emotional arousal or

1401

emotional valence between the words presented in
the L1 or the L2. First, all L1 words including the adjectives presented in L1 were matched for emotional
valence and arousal using previous word rating data
(see section Stimuli and experimental study design).
Second, as in many previous EEG-ERP studies, the
emotional adjectives were significantly scoring higher
in emotional arousal than neutral adjectives in both
languages (L1 and L2); the negative adjectives were
rated lower and the positive adjectives higher in
emotional valence than the neutral adjective in the L1
and in the L2, the latter being shown in an online
rating study in which women and men of comparable
age and a L2 history comparable to the participants
who took part in the EEG study were asked to rate the
words presented in the EEG study using SAM ratings of
valence and arousal (see Tables 1-6). The SAM scales
provide a non-verbal judgment of valence and
emotional arousal asking participants to appraise
without cognitive reflection the degree of bodily physiological arousal elicited by a stimulus including a quick
appraisal of the pleasantness and unpleasantness of
the stimulus valence along a continuum of bodily pleasant/unpleasantness. Thus, at a subjective level, L2
adjectives referring to emotional feeling states and
traits were judged to elicit similar bodily arousal states
and experiences of pleasantness and unpleasantness
as reported for the L1 adjectives of the previous word
rating data and in both languages emotional adjectives
received significantly higher arousal scores than neutral
adjectives. Many previous studies found the EPN to be
modulated by the emotional arousal dimension being
larger for positive and negative words or pictures
scoring higher in emotional arousal compared to the
neutral words or pictures (e.g. Herbert et al., 2008;
Kissler et al., 2007, 2009; Schacht & Sommer, 2009; for
pictures e.g. Junghofer et al., 2001; Schupp et al.,
2006). Some previous studies found the EPN to be
modulated by the emotional valence dimension, for
example EPN amplitudes being larger for positive
words (matched in arousal with negative words)
(Kissler et al., 2009), and this additionally when processed in a second language L2 (Conrad et al., 2011).
Thus, in the brain, intuitive and by far and large nonsemantic appraisals of the emotional valence and the
emotional arousal intensity of a stimulus as assessed
on a subjective level with the non-verbal Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scales (Bradley & Lang, 1994)
might be reflected in the modulation of the EPN, even
if the stimulus presented and to be appraised is a
word. In line with this assumption, the present results
suggest that during early stages of word processing, a
word's emotional meaning is intuitively appraised in

1402

terms of valence and in terms of its bodily physiological
arousal in the L1 as well as in the L2. This is at least in the
EPN time window more pronounced in the L2, despite a
general larger amplitude modulation of the EPN by the
L1 irrespective of the word's content (emotional or
neutral). Also, a recent study investigating affective judgments of e.g. emotional versus neutral adjectives did not
find any significant processing differences between the
L1 and the L2, neither in reaction times nor in the modulation of the EPN (Kissler & Bromberek-Dyzman, 2021).
In the present study, the EPN emotion effects were
temporally not the earliest differentiation between
emotional and neutral adjectives but preceded by an
earlier emotion effect in the N100 time window. As
found for the EPN modulation, the amplitudes of the
N100 were modulated by the factor "emotion".
However, in contrast to the EPN time window, in the
N100 time window, positive adjectives describing positive feeling states and traits elicited larger N100 amplitude modulation than negative or neutral adjectives.
This emotion advantage was not interacting with the
factor "task", but interacting with the factors "language"
and "hemisphere". In the L1 and the L2, the positive
adjectives elicited significantly larger N100 modulation
compared to the negative or the neutral adjectives
suggesting a positivity bias. This positivity bias (positive
> negative or neutral) was found in the L1 bilaterally,
while in the L2 processing of negative and positive
adjectives facilitated N100 amplitudes compared to
neutral adjectives in the left posterior electrode cluster.
A positivity bias in the N100 time window resembles
the findings of a recent EEG-ERP affective judgment
study using emotional and neutral adjectives presented
in the L1 (German) and the L2 (English) under experimentally induced positive and negative mood induction
(Kissler & Bromberek-Dyzman, 2021). Positive mood
induction facilitated the processing of positive adjectives in the N100 time window. In the present study,
mood was not induced experimentally. However, the
participants' ratings obtained after the experiment
showed that from all the word categories that were presented, positive adjectives induced self-referentiality, i.e.
participants related the words to their own Self during
processing. This self-referentiality effect is well known
in the literature showing that participants tend to
ascribe positive but not negative character and feeling
states automatically to the Self (for an overview,
Rogers et al., 1977). The present results are one of the
few results suggesting that this self-positivity effect
can operate very early in time during word processing
(for later effects of positivity biases in ERP studies in a
native language, see e.g. Fields & Kuperberg, 2016,
2016; Herbert et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2007). The

present results furthermore imply that the N100 positivity bias can additionally occur in L2 (for positivity effects
in L2 in the EPN time window see Conrad et al., 2011)
and in the L2 is extended to the processing of negative
words if the second language is used as a socially warm
language for daily interaction.
Tentative evidence for this latter assumption comes
from the exploratory analysis in which a comparison
was made between the participants who reported to
use English (L2) for their daily interaction or not. This
showed that the positivity bias in the N100 time
window selectively occurred in the group of participants
who used English (L2) for daily social interaction. Thus,
these early N100-related emotion effects for positive
trait and state words can occur in both languages, the
L1 and the L2 in time windows too early for semantic
access. Critically, these effects may not be explained by
word category differences in the lexical domains or by
word category differences between negative and positive adjectives in emotional arousal. Word length or
word frequency were controlled and did not differ
between emotional and neutral words in the L1 nor in
the L2, respectively. Alternatively, mood (Kissler & Bromberek-Dyzman, 2021) or, as suggested in the present
study, self-referential stimulus appraisals and the use
of the L2 as a warm social language for daily emotion
exchange might be contextual or situational factors significantly determining which word categories are
subject to early facilitated, probably pre-semantic processing. Theoretically, self-appraisals are considered
internal contextual/situational factors that act on a prereflective experiental level as selective filters of attention
or as amplifiers early during stimulus processing (Arnold,
1960; Scherer et al., 2001), with self-appraisal being independent from the stimulus modality or the stimulus' linguistic or non-linguistic nature. Interestingly, in contrast
to positive adjectives, negative adjectives compared to
neutral adjectives elicited larger N100 amplitudes in
the L2 only and merely in the left hemisphere
suggesting a negativity bias in the L2 in the languagedominant hemisphere. The stronger emotion effect for
negative adjectives in the L2 continued in the L2 into
the EPN time window and was positively correlated
with the participants self-report of using the L2 as a
social language. These L2 emotion advantages in the
N100 and the EPN time windows run counter the
emotional detachment hypothesis that suggests
weaker or detached processing of emotions in the L2.
Emotional detachment has been reported in many previous L1-L2 studies investigating primarily bodily
responses to emotional L1 versus L2 words and
especially using strongly unpleasant and arousing
emotional words such as curse or taboo words (e.g.

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

Dewaele, 2004; Harris, 2004; for an overview Pavlenko,
2008, 2012). Similar to the present findings a number
of recent studies using EEG or other methods do not
support weaker emotion effects in the L2, and in line
with the present findings suggest emotion effects in
L2 as measured by eye tracking or early ERPs (Kissler &
Bromberek-Dyzman, 2021; Ponari et al., 2015; Sheikh &
Titone, 2016; for reaction time studies see e.g. Kuhne &
Gianelli, 2019 for a short review).
In sum, these findings support early, valence and
arousal selective emotion effects in the L1 and the L2
in a time window of word processing of the N100 that
is preceding lexico-semantic access and that is continuing into the EPN time window in which lexico-semantic
access is according to previous research (e.g. Kissler
et al., 2007) expected to be possibly occurring. In the
present study, effects occurred bilaterally, for the left
and the right posterior electrode clusters, or were
more pronounced in the posterior electrode cluster of
the left, language dominant hemisphere.
Research into the spatio-temporal processing of
different object classes suggest that the visual object
recognition system comprises subsystems of neural networks that are selectively responding to one type of
visual input including words, or faces or objects
(Rossion et al., 2003). According to these findings, the
visual subsystems for words is more strongly lateralised
to the left hemisphere compared the visual subsystems
processing faces or objects, as is indicated by hemisphere specific modulation of N100-like ERP potentials
to these classes of stimuli. One could, therefore, speculate that the N100 modulation found in the present
study, comprising on the one hand, N100 modulation
by negative adjectives in the second language (L2) in
the language dominant, left hemisphere as well as on
the other hand, the N100 modulation by positive adjectives in the L1 and the L2 in the left and right hemisphere, reflects two different modes of processing
linguistic information: linguistic feature processing of
negative, non-self-referential words in the left hemisphere and additionally non-linguistic processing of
the sensory or functional (i.e. emotional) attributes of
positive, self-referential words in the right, languagenon dominant hemisphere. In line with this interpretation, a recent ERP-intracranial EEG study found righthemisphere dominant N170 modulation and activity
changes along the right-hemisphere dominant face processing network by words expressing facial emotions. In
the present study, the processing of the emotional
adjectives conveying positive feelings may similarly activate these sub-regions for non-linguistic conceptual processing (Proverbio et al., 2007). Why this is possible in
the L1 or the L2 could be due to the social language

1403

use of the participants using the L2 as a warm language,
albeit according to the assessment by questionnaire and
a vocabulary test, all participants were similarly proficient and fluent in the L2. However, given that the
present findings on social warmness of the L2 use are
exploratory, the findings are speculative and preliminary
and await future research and replication. According to
the theoretical hypothesis of an embodied neural
reuse (Pulvermuller, 2018), an intuitive understanding
of the L2 emotional words in L2 users may develop in
a valence-dependent manner as a cumulative experience between repeated use of the words, the emotions
felt, and, as suggested and shown in previous studies by
internal factors such as mood (Kissler & BromberekDyzman, 2021) or by intuitive self-appraisals as
suggested by the results of the present study.

Time course of body-related versus neutral word
processing in the L1 and the L2
Self-reference appraisals and warm language use might
not have been the only contextual factors that supported early facilitated and emotional processing of
words in the L1 or the L2 in the present study. Adjectives
referring to a lean or overweight body were like the
emotional adjectives preferentially processed in the
time window of the EPN, irrespective of the language
(L1 or L2), the hemisphere or the task at hand. In
addition, the processing of adjectives referring to an
overweight body was associated with a more pronounced modulation of the N100 amplitudes compared
to the processing of neutral adjectives, especially in the
left posterior electrode cluster. Again, these effects
cannot be explained by differences in lexical dimensions
between the words because body adjectives and neutral
adjectives did not significantly differ in word length or
word frequency in the L1 or the L2. Moreover and apparently, emotional adjectives, neutral adjectives and body
shape/weight related adjectives are similarly abstract
and thus not more or less concrete than the other
word category but certainly more abstract than the concrete body nouns.
The body shape/weight related adjectives referring
to a lean or overweight body were rated as eliciting significantly higher feelings of unpleasantness/pleasantness and states of bodily arousal compared to the
neutral adjectives. Valence and arousal ratings of
body shape/weight related adjectives were significantly
below the ratings of valence and arousal of emotional
L1 or L2 adjectives but above those for the body
nouns referring to upper or lower body parts. Particularly, in Western societies, women and men follow a
drive for thinness, and a fear of getting fat (Levitt,

1404

C. HERBERT

2003). Although the drive for thinness or fear of getting
fat might be most pronounced in women and men with
high body dissatisfaction, an anti-fat bias (intuitive aversion against overweight) and an ideal thin body image
are the norm rather than the exception in the Western
world, dictated by Western social norms of an ideal thin
body image and body attitude stereotypes, learned
early in life (Thompson & Stice, 2001). Critically, these
emotionally and motivationally challenging social
norms of a lean body image as well as the stigmatisation of an overweight physique are known to have a
strong impact on body dissatisfaction (Hargreaves &
Tiggemann, 2003) and on information processing, for
example facilitating activation of approach and avoidance (e.g. Herbert et al., 2013) and attention (Markus
et al., 1987). Correspondingly EEG studies found the
anti-fat bias to drive selective attentive processing of
pictures of obese body shapes in the time window of
early affective evaluation indicated by EPN modulation
(e.g. Schupp & Renner, 2001). Moreover, even earlier
effects (N100, N170) have been reported for bodyrelated adjectives and nouns referring to an overweight
shape in selective samples of women scoring high on
scales measuring the degree of thoughts, feelings,
and behaviours related to fatness and overweight concerns (Gao et al., 2011). The present results corroborate
that early facilitated processing of body-related stimuli
with a socially and individually related positive or negative emotional connotation is not restricted to nonlexical stimuli or to women with a fear of fatness but
that EPN modulation also occurs in a with respect to
fear of fatness non-selective sample of women and
men during the processing of body shape/weight
related adjectives relative to neutral adjectives during
both passive reading or shallow word encoding of
word counting. This suggests that body traits connoting thinness or fatness undergo rapid appraisal of
valence and arousal and this albeit not directly referring
to a concrete feeling state such as emotional adjectives.
Moreover for body-related words, such valence and
arousal effects seem to occur rather spontaneously or
implicitly, because the EPN effects were not interacting
with the task at hand nor with the language (L1 or L2)
in which the body-related adjectives were presented.
For the body overweight adjectives, the EPN modulation was accompanied by N100 modulation in the
language dominant left hemisphere. The modulation
of the N100 and the EPN by body adjectives suggests
that internal factors such as self-appraisal but also internalised social norms may promote fast linguistic feature
processing (left-hemisphere dominant N100 modulation) and subsequent valence and arousal evaluation
(EPN) of body weight/shape words whose meaning

we learn from daily social exposure and experience to
admire or reject.
Emotional adjectives, neutral adjectives and body
shape/weight related adjectives were presented
together with nouns referring to concrete parts of the
upper or lower body as well as with neutral nouns
related to objects. It is well known that, besides the preferences of neural networks for the processing of features of words, faces or objects, there are neurons in
the ventral visual processing stream that selectively
respond to visual presentations depicting body parts.
This preference for body parts has been located in
body sensitive areas of the so called fusiform body
area (Schwarzlose et al., 2008), and selective processing
has been shown to occur as early as in the N100 time
window in studies comparing the processing of non-linguistic body part stimuli and non-body stimuli (Taylor
et al., 2010). A recent study using ERP methodology
and intracranial ERP methodology found that nouns
denoting facial body parts (mouth, nose, etc.) elicit
N170 like ERPs in the visual face processing network
during a semantic decision task compared to nouns
referring to non-facial body parts (Garcia et al., 2020).
In the present study, no such early preference for the
processing of body part related nouns compared to
neutral nouns was found in neither of the two task- or
language conditions (L1 or L2). However, akin to the
body shape/weight related adjectives, the processing
of the nouns with references to upper or lower body
parts elicited significantly larger amplitudes in the EPN
time window compared to the neutral nouns but only
in the L1. The EPN modulation by L1 nouns referring
to body parts is in line with the results of a previous
study that examined startle reflex modulation in
healthy women during reading of body nouns and
neutral nouns that were presented in the L1 of the participants. In this study, body-related nouns significantly
modulated the acoustically elicited startle reflex
suggesting activation of motivational defensive
systems during reading of body nouns related to the
lower body, especially in women reporting higher
body dissatisfaction than the average of the all-femalesample (Herbert et al., 2013). Theoretically, EPN modulation by body nouns is commensurable with the motivational priming hypothesis, suggesting that emotional
stimuli are appraised for their emotional valence and
bodily arousal before calling the organism to arms
(Lang et al., 1998). The latter (activation of approach
and avoidance) may then occur specifically for words eliciting a negative connotation in the reader, and
especially in women at risk of eating disorders (Herbert
et al., 2013). However, the modulation of the EPN by
body part nouns seems to be specific to the L1 and

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

the language dominant hemisphere. This L1-restricted
processing effect for concrete words (nouns) compared
to adjectives may be explained by studies on word
acquisition. These studies suggest that emotionally
valenced words that are often also more abstract
words are learned earlier in childhood compared to concrete words and this earlier acquisition seems to hold
even for the L2 (e.g. Ponari et al., 2015; Vigliocco et al.,
2014).

L1 and L2: memory effects, ratings, and EEG-ERPs
Words were equally remembered in both languages, the
L1 and the L2. Especially emotionally positive adjectives
were better remembered than neutral adjectives in the
L1 and the L2 supporting the positivity bias during
word processing. In addition, the body adjectives
related to an overweight body size/shape were better
remembered than the neutral adjectives in the L1 and
the L2. In addition, body nouns related to lower body
parts were better remembered than the neutral nouns
in L1. The results cannot be explained by carry over
effects between the L1 and the L2 words or by cognitive
switch because the German L1 words and the English L2
synonyms were presented in different randomised
blocks. Similar results of no memory advantage for
emotional words in the L1 and even stronger L2
memory effects were reported by Aycicegi-Dinn and
Caldwell-Harris (2004) during a shallow encoding task.
In addition, a memory advantage in the L1 only was
reported in another study using a deep encoding task
(Aycicegi-Dinn & Caldwell-Harris, 2009). In the present
study, RSVP designs, specifically triggering conceptual
short term memory (Potter, 1984) in combination with
a silent reading task or a word counting (shallow encoding) task were used which might have prevented one
language to benefit more than the other from a more
effortful and deeper conceptual (probably top-down)
processing.
Whether the present results are in support of selective
activation and retrieval of L1 and L2 stimuli as proposed
by the Revised Hierarchical Model (RHM) (for an overview
see Kroll et al., 2010) cannot be answered by the present
study but should be investigated in future studies using
shallow as well as deep encoding tasks and L2 words comprising both, L1 synonyms and new L2 words. Consensus
may exists that quantitative differences between a speaker's or a perceiver's word lexicon related to the L2 and the
native language (L1) exist, especially if the L2 is learned
late in life and constitutes the foreign language rather
than the second language used and spoken in parallel
to L1. In the present study, participants had good proficiency of the L2 as was additionally indicated by the vocabulary test performance yielding an 80% accuracy of

1405

choosing the correct L1 word translation. Regarding the
processing of emotions in the L1 and the L2 much previous evidence converges on the view that for late learners of a second language, the L2 feels like the
emotionally detached or disembodied language (e.g. Pavlenko, 2008, 2012). The results of the present study do not
lend strong support for this thesis, when looking at the
self-report measures and the modulation of the early
brain potentials. The English (L2) words were rated in a
pilot study by a sample of N = 208 women and men
who were not participating in the EEG study but who
had similar language and sociodemographic background
and language proficiency as the participants of the EEG
study. The participants of the pilot study rated the
emotional and body-related adjectives and nouns in the
L2 as more unpleasant or pleasant and as more arousing
than the neutral L2 adjectives or the neutral L2 nouns. In
addition and as discussed already above, the participants
taking part in the EEG study remembered emotional
adjectives and body shape/weight adjectives even
better or equally well in both languages.
Yet, "language" (L1 vs. L2) effects were found to
modulate the N100 and EPN amplitudes. The first
language effect was related to a main effect of the
factor "language", i.e. the extent to which the amplitudes of the early brain potentials were overall more
pronounced during word processing in L1 versus L2.
The second language effect observed was related to
the extent to which emotional versus neutral or bodyrelated versus neutral processing occurred bilaterally
or was more pronounced in the parieto-occipital electrode cluster of the left hemisphere. The language
specific interaction effects of emotion by hemisphere
that were observed in the time windows of the N100
or the EPN were valence-specific and concerning
words with a negative or a positive connotation rather
than the neutral words (i.e. the nouns referring to
objects or the adjectives referring to neutral traits or
states). Modality specific laterality is well described in
early auditory speech processing, showing segmental
processing in the left occipito-temporal cortex and processing of the suprasegmental features in the right temporal cortex (STG), (Kotz et al., 2003). Similarly, early
hemisphere-related modality dependent visual processing has been described in time windows preceding
the EPN suggesting that left-hemisphere specific
neurons in the ventral visual processing stream are
more excitable by lexical stimuli than by non-lexical
stimuli, whereas processing of non-lexical stimuli (faces
or visual objects) is more pronounced in the right
ventral visual processing stream or accompanied by
bilateral activation. Whether valence-specific lateralised
or bilateral processing in the N100 or EPN time

1406

C. HERBERT

windows as a function of the L1 or the L2 reflects similar
differences should be investigated in future studies,
ideally using normalised EEG-data for hemisphere comparisons (e.g. Herbert et al., 2008). Regarding the N100
early effects preceding the EPN, in the present study,
the participants' use of the L2 language as a "warm
language" that is used for daily conversation seemed
to have influenced the emotion effects in the L2, - in
line with the general assumption of embodiment.

Conclusion, limitations and future outlook
Early and embodied?
Previous neuroscientific research including EEG-ERP
studies using action words, concrete perceptual/
sensory words or concrete body-related words have
accumulated evidence in support of an embodied
account of word processing by showing that concrete
words and action words elicit modulation of early
brain potentials known to be indicators of the processes
involved in modality-specific feature processing of e.g.
faces, bodies, actions or specific bodily somatosensory
sensations (for an overview and a discussion see e.g. Pulvermuller et al., 2009). Emotional words are significantly
more abstract compared to action or perception words
even when instead of adjectives, nouns or verbs are
used as word classes (Vigliocco et al., 2014). The
present EEG-ERP study does not imply differential involvement of motor cortex regions in the processing of
emotional words or body words. Such an involvement
has recently been found for the processing of emotional
action words (Moseley et al., 2012). Theoretically,
emotions serve the purpose of bodily activation of
defense and approach, of rapid appraisal of valence
and arousal and feelings of pleasure or displeasure
(Lang, 1995). These processes are obligatory steps of
emotion processing and, therefore, they should modulate emotional word processing if word processing is
embodied. Modality-preferential processing related to
action simulation as for example found and reported
in some previous studies might apply only to certain
emotional stimuli that include the simulation of
specific actions and perceptions in their approach or
avoidance repertoire (such as action words, Moseley
et al., 2012). For emotion processing in the brain, the
embodied processes necessary for bodily approach or
defense might occur via high- and low cortical and subcortical routes established between primary and secondary visual/auditory cortices and subcortical emotion
structures such as the amygdala (Amaral et al., 1992;
for words e.g. Herbert et al., 2009; for a discussion, e.g.
Lang et al., 1997; Vuilleumier & Driver, 2007).

In the present study, the modulation of early brain
potentials, specifically the EPN, was found across word
categories, the EPN being enhanced during the processing of emotional adjectives connoting emotional feelings and during the processing of body-related
adjectives related to body image traits or nouns
related to body parts. The fact that EPN modulation
was found across word categories in accordance with
ratings of valence and arousal speaks to the idea that
the EPN modulation is not specific to the processing of
emotional words but reflects the processing stage at
which probably any stimulus input is appraised for
valence and arousal. Especially, when viewed from a
temporal word processing perspective, it is likely that
valence and arousal appraisals co-occur at the stages
of visual processing at which early and first possible
lexico-semantic access has been empirically and theoretically expected, i.e. around 200-300 ms respectively
(for an overview, e.g. Dien, 2009).
The idea that the EPN as a brain potential might indicate both, emotional appraisal and lexico-semantic
access does not exclude the assumption that the
emotional appraisal processes by themselves are nonverbal, implicit and pre-reflective, especially when EPN
effects are elicited bilaterally in the language dominant
and the language intuitive right hemisphere. Moreover,
the EPN by emotion effects emerged irrespective of the
task, and therefore, seem not to require or be dependent
on semantic categorisation processes. This is interesting
because previous EEG-ERP studies using emotional
scenes or words and RSVP designs in combination with
a selective attention task or passive viewing or reading
task report a relative invariance of the EPN emotion
effects to manipulations of selective attention including
repetition of runs in RSVP designs (e.g. Herbert et al.,
2008; Kissler et al., 2009; Schupp et al., 2003, 2006).
However, further studies found the EPN emotion
effects to be sensitive to manipulations of low-level
stimulus features such as stimulus size, font size or
stimulus contrast (Bayer et al., 2012; Schindler et al.,
2018) or to tasks requiring no lexico-semantic access
(Hinojosa et al., 2010). Regarding the present RSVP
study, there was little evidence for an interaction of
the tasks (blocks of passive reading vs. blocks of word
counting) with the selective processing of the words.
Task as a main factor significantly influenced the amplitude modulation of all early ERP potentials (P1, N1, and
EPN) in almost all word category comparisons and sometimes interacted with the language (L1 vs. L2), confirming that the task at hand plays a general role during
early word processing. It is unlikely that the free recall
memory examination performed after the runs contributed to these task effects. If so, one would expect that the

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

memory examination intensified word processing in
both, the passive reading and the active counting
blocks as a possible anticipatory effect of the repeated
surprise free recall test. Nevertheless, in the statistical
analyses, the tasks never interacted with the emotionality or the body-reference of the presented words as the
two distinctive semantic-affective dimensions along
which emotional and body-related adjectives and
nouns differed from neutral adjectives and neutral
nouns during the repeated blocks of word processing.
Furthermore, the EPN emotion effects are found for
non-verbal stimuli (emotional pictures and scenes)
which paves the way for questions about the specificity
and functionality of the EPN as a brain potential occurring during word processing temporally prior to the
N400 (the indicator of semantic processing), but temporally after ERP potentials that are more selectively
responding to differences in perceptual or sensory
modality features of a stimulus (e.g. N100), e.g. Binder
et al., 2009; Binder & Fernandino, 2015. In summary,
among all different embodied and modality preferential
theories, the present results support best a domainspecific embodiment account for the processing of
emotional information in opposition to a perceptualmotor (sensory/functional) account (e.g. see Adorni &
Proverbio, 2009). According to the accounts of domain
specificity, words belonging to certain word categories
are processed in specialised and functionally dissociated
neural circuits in the brain due to their evolutionary
advantage (e.g. see Adorni & Proverbio, 2009). The
modulation patterns of the N100 and the EPN by the
emotionality of the word might fit to this theoretical
notion. However, these interpretations definitively
require further proof from future studies. In addition,
further investigations of the present observations that
the self-referentiality, the social relevance of the
content conveyed by the words and the use of the
second language as a warm language might constitute
experiental and situated factors that can facilitate early
visual word processing across the L1 and the L2,
should be further investigated to validate the assumptions of embodied cognition accounts that are proposing context and situatedness as two important
embodied factors influencing information processing
in general (Barsalou, 2010; Barsalou et al., 2008) and
emotion processing in particular. Extending the
findings of the present study to other languages could
provide further understanding of the individual and
the contextual factors that drive early facilitated processing of emotional words and body-related words and
should be investigated in further studies preferably combining electrophysiological measures with other
methods such as functional magnetic resonance

1407

activity to examine further the degree of embodied

Acknowledgements
This study is basic research with no potential clinical applications and no harm or risk that would go beyond the risk of
daily living. As described in the manuscript, the study followed
ethical guidelines for psychological research (e.g. DGPs, 2018)
including the debriefing of the participants about the purpose
of the study, the methods (EEG recording), and the inclusion
and exclusion criteria before the study. The study participation
was voluntary, participants could opt out the study at any time
of the study without undue request, they were debriefed about
the inclusion and exclusion criteria before the start of the study
and could ask questions, no vulnerable groups were investigated (all healthy volunteers), the EEG recordings were done
in a scientific and standardised lab environment, the data
was pseudonymised and the recorded data was treated
according to data privacy policies. The volunteers had to
give written informed consent prior to study participation.

Disclosure statement
No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.
