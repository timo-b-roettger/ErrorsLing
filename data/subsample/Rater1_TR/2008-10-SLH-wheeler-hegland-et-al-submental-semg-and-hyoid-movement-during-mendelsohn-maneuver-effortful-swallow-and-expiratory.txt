Purpose: This study investigated the concurrent biomechanical and electromyographic
properties of 2 swallow-specific tasks (effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuver) and
1 swallow-nonspecific (expiratory muscle strength training [EMST]) swallow therapy
task in order to examine the differential effects of each on hyoid motion and associated
submental activation in healthy adults, with the overall goal of characterizing
task-specific and overload properties of each task.
Method: Twenty-five healthy male and female adults (M = 25 years of age) participated
in this prospective, experimental study with 1 participant group. Each participant
completed all study tasks (including normal swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver swallow,
effortful swallow, and EMST task) in random order during concurrent videofluoroscopy
and surface electromyography recording.
Results: Results revealed significant differences in the trajectory of hyoid motion as
measured by overall displacement and angle of elevation of the hyoid bone. As well,
timing of hyoid movement and amplitude differences existed between tasks with
regard to the activation of the submental musculature.
Conclusions: Study results demonstrated differential effects of the 3 experimental tasks
on the principles of task specificity and overload. These principles are important in the
development of effective rehabilitative programs. Subsequent direction for future
research is suggested.

wallowing is a biomechanical process characterized quantitatively
by displacement of oropharyngeal structures and associated timing
and duration of movement during a swallow (Cook et al., 1989;
Dodds, Stewart, & Logemann, 1990; Ekberg & Hillarp, 1986; Logemann,
Rademaker, Pauloski, Ohmae, & Kahrilas, 1998). The oropharyngeal
stage of swallowing is important for airway protection, bolus transport to
the esophagus, and ultimately the ability to maintain adequate nutrition
and health. Videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing, the preferred
method for measuring displacements and timing of the oral and pharyngeal structures during swallow, allows for structural and bolus visualization when barium contrast is used. As radiographic images are

sensitive to tissue density, bone is much more readily
identifiable than other less dense tissue such as cartilage, connective tissues, or muscle (Dodds et al., 1990;
Donner, 1985; Ekberg, 1986). Therefore, measurements
of hyoid bone movement and timing have been part of
focused investigations in order to document swallow impairment and treatment outcome.
Hyoid bone movement during the pharyngeal stage
of swallowing is accomplished primarily by the contraction of the submental muscles, consisting of the anterior
belly of the digastric, mylohyoid, and geniohyoid muscles (Crary, Carnaby Mann, & Groher, 2006; Dodds et al.,
1990; Doty & Bosma, 1956; Perlman, Palmer, McCulloch,
& Vandaele, 1999). A useful tool for assessing the activation of the submental muscle group is surface electromyography (sEMG), which has yielded information about
the onset and offset of muscle activation during swallow.
Studies indicate that a strong correlation between submental muscle activation and hyoid bone movement exists
(Crary et al., 2006; Palmer, Luschei, Jaffe, & McCulloch,
1999; Perlman et al., 1999; Shaker, Dodds, Dantas, Hogan,
& Arndorfer, 1990). Measurement of hyoid movement
has been accomplished by numerous investigators and has
been defined by its anterior and superior movements as
well as by its angle of movement and trajectory of movement (Ekberg, 1986; Leonard, Kendall, McKenzie,
Goncalves, & Walker, 2000; Logemann et al., 2000). It is
likely, although not proven, that swallow muscle weakness/
discoordination and /or related movement abnormalities to the hyoid bone may relate to the presence of
penetration /aspiration of the bolus into the airway and /
or decreased extent and duration of upper esophageal
( UES) opening. Conditions that affect the strength or
timing of the submental muscle contraction, in particular,
such as structural changes that are due to surgical alteration and neurodegenerative diseases or stroke, may
manifest as altered sEMG activation concurrent with
decreased movement of the hyoid bone (Bartolome &
Neumann, 1993; Lazarus et al., 1996, 2000; Martino,
Terrault, Ezerzer, Mikulis, & Diamant, 2001). Findings
like these have resulted in further study of the submental sEMG activity and the movement of the hyoid bone
(visualized using videofluoroscopy), particularly with
regard to rehabilitation of swallowing, and have demonstrated that the biomechanical aspects of swallow
can be voluntarily manipulated via rehabilitation in
both healthy adults and those with pathological disease
processes. Specifically, biomechanical events including tongue base contact with the posterior pharyngeal
wall, hyoid bone movement, and UES opening can be
altered in terms of duration and /or amplitude (Bulow,
Olsson, & Ekberg, 1999; Ding, Larson, Logemann, &
Rademaker, 2002; Hind, Nicosia, Roecker, Carnes, &
Robbins, 2001; Lazarus, Logemann, & Gibbons, 1993;
Logemann, 1999). For example, the Mendelsohn maneuver

significantly increases maximal vertical hyoid displacement during swallowing (Bulow et al., 1999; Ding et al.,
2002; Hind et al., 2001; Lazarus et al., 1993; Logemann,
1999).
Swallow therapies or maneuvers in particular
are traditionally used as compensatory mechanisms to
overcome dysphagia resulting from impaired swallowing musculature or decreased range of motion of various
head or neck structures (Clark, 2003; Langmore & Miller,
1994; Logemann, 1999). To date, the five most widely documented swallowing-specific (i.e., execution of the maneuver includes a swallow) maneuvers are as follows:
(a) the supraglottic swallow, (b) the super-supraglottic
swallow, (c) the Masako technique, (d) the effortful swallow,
and (e) the Mendelsohn maneuver. Each maneuver targets specific aspects of oral or pharyngeal swallow physiology (e.g., tongue base contact with posterior pharyngeal
wall, airway protection, and UES opening; Clark, 2003;
Langmore & Miller, 1994; Logemann, 1999). The effortful swallow and the Mendelsohn maneuver both positively affect displacements and durations associated with
hyoid movement during swallow (Bulow et al., 1999; Ding
et al., 2002; Hind et al., 2001; Huckabee, Butler, Barclay,
& Jit, 2005; Lazarus, Logemann, Song, Rademaker, &
Kahrilas, 2002). Effortful swallow increases hyoid vertical
displacement, the duration of hyoid anterior excursion,
duration of UES opening, and the amplitude of submental
muscle activation in healthy adult participants (Bulow
et al., 1999; Hind et al., 2001; Huckabee et al., 2005). As
indicated previously, the Mendelsohn maneuver significantly increases maximal vertical hyoid displacement
during swallowing; additionally, it prolongs UES opening and results in higher peak amplitudes and longer duration of submental muscle activation (Ding et al., 2002;
Lazarus et al., 1993, 2002).
Recently, pilot videofluoroscopic data as well as sEMG
data (Wheeler, Chiara, & Sapienza, 2007) indicate that a
respiratory-based therapy program may have a rehabilitative effect on the swallow mechanism via increased
submental muscle activation and subsequent hyoid
elevation. Specifically, pilot videofluoroscopic studies of
two healthy adults using an expiratory muscle strength
training ( EMST) device demonstrated hyoid vertical
elevation and velopharyngeal closure during active blowing into the expiratory muscle training device (Figure 1).
As well, a study using sEMG demonstrated increased
activation of the submental muscles during EMST tasks
versus normal swallowing tasks (Wheeler et al., 2007).
This preliminary evidence suggested that the EMST
device may be applicable to swallowing rehabilitation
via increasing the force-generating ability of the submental muscles in a manner similar to swallow-specific
counterparts. Notably, the device has positive crosssystem effects on pulmonary, cough, and vocal loudness
improvements (Kim, 2006; Saleem, Sapienza, & Okun,

successfully engage in the functionally oriented, taskspecific exercise).

For any exercise (including those discussed earlier) to have an impact on rehabilitation, it should be
chosen based on posited pathophysiology of the impairment, observed symptoms, and functional needs (Clark,
2003; Hamdy et al., 1998). As well, the exercises should
capitalize on the principles of task specificity and
overload, which govern the development of effective
exercise programs in healthy individuals and for rehabilitation programs. The principle of specificity holds
that the best way to train a certain function is to do
exercises that are similar to, or identical to, that function. The principle of overload holds that in order to
increase the force-generating ability of a muscle, that
muscle must be taxed beyond its current capacity to
respond. That is, it must be exposed to a load greater
than what it is typically exposed to on a daily basis
(i.e., lifting a weight; Aagaard, Simonsen, Andersen,
Magnusson, & Dyhre-Poulsen, 2002; Behm & Sale,
1993; Edstrom & Grimby, 1986; Kraemer, Fleck, &
Evans, 1996; Powers & Howley, 2001). These principles
are not mutually exclusive, and it may be ideal for an
exercise/rehabilitation program to encompass both principles such that one may serve as a primer for another
(e.g., improving force generation capacity in order to

Therefore, this study sought to investigate the concurrent biomechanical and electromyographic properties of two swallow-specific tasks (effortful swallow and
Mendelsohn maneuver) and one swallow-nonspecific
( EMST) swallow therapy task in order to examine the
differential effects of each on hyoid motion and associated submental activation in healthy adults, with the
overall goal of characterizing task-specific and overload
properties of each task. Normal discrete swallows were
used as a control condition. No study to our knowledge
has simultaneously examined videofluoroscopic and submental sEMG activation measures during the performance
of these tasks. Acquiring these measures simultaneously
allowed the distinctive physiologic properties (e.g., taskspecific and overload components) of the tasks to be
defined. First, it was hypothesized that the trajectory of
hyoid motion, as defined by maximum displacements and
elevation angles of the hyoid bone, would be significantly
different between the tasks. Second, it was hypothesized
that task-related differences would exist for measures of
sEMG activity in terms of amplitude and timing measures. Third, it was hypothesized that the relation between hyoid trajectory measures and sEMG measures
would be different between the tasks.

Method
Participants
Twenty-five healthy adults served as participants
for this prospective experimental study with one participant group. There were 15 women (ages 18-35 years, M =
24 years) and 10 men (ages 19-33 years, M = 26 years;
see Table 1). All participants completed a questionnaire

Tasks
Normal Discrete Swallows
Three normal discrete swallows were used as a control condition. All participants completed three normal
swallows of 10-mL thin liquid barium ( Varibar contrast
agents, EZ-EM, Inc.). These trials, along with the study's
experimental tasks (described next), were presented in a
randomized order for each participant.

Respiratory Pressure Measurement
and EMST Task
Measurement of maximal expiratory pressures
( MEP) was obtained for each participant in order to set
the expiratory muscle training device at 75% of the MEP.
This training percentage has been used in numerous
studies (Baker, Davenport, & Sapienza, 2005; Saleem,
Sapienza, Rosenbek, Musson, & Okun, 2005; Sapienza
et al., 2002). Replicating the trainer setting was imperative to generalize the previous study outcomes to the
current outcomes. To obtain MEP, the participant stood
upright with a nose clip in place. After inhaling completely, or to total lung capacity, a disposable mouthpiece
coupled to a manometer (Smart Manometer 350, Meriam
Instruments) was placed in the participant's mouth,
and he or she exhaled as fast and hard as possible.
Each maneuver was repeated for each participant until
three trials were achieved within 5% of each other
(Baker et al., 2005). Participants waited a minimum of
30 s between each trial in order to avoid dizziness or
lightheadedness.
The EMST device is a calibrated instrument consisting of a mouthpiece with a one-way spring-loaded valve
(Baker et al., 2005), and it is referred to as an expiratory
pressure threshold trainer. The valve blocks airflow produced by the user until a sufficient "threshold" pressure
is produced to overcome the force. The maximum threshold of the device is 150 cm H2O, and the range is from
0 cm H2O to 150 cm H2O. As previously indicated, the
target threshold was defined as 75% of each participant's
MEP. For example, if a participant's baseline MEP was
100 cm H2O, the device was set at 75 cm H2O for the experimental portion of the study. To reach the threshold
pressure, participants were required to breathe out with
sufficient expiratory effort to open the valve against a
calibrated adjustable spring (Figure 2). Following MEP
measurement and successful practice of the EMST task
set at 75% MEP, participants performed three trials of
the task during simultaneous sEMG and videofluorographic recording. The trials of this task were randomized along with the other experimental tasks.

Mendelsohn Maneuver
and Effortful Swallow
For the Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful swallow
tasks, each participant was trained by the principal investigator to ensure proper execution of the task. Scripted
directions for the Mendelsohn maneuver were as follows:
"Put your hand on your throat and feel when you swallow. You can feel your Adam's apple move up. Now, when
you swallow I want you to hold your Adam's Apple up for
a few seconds, squeezing your throat and neck muscles
and not letting go" (Logemann, 1999). The sEMG signals
were displayed to the participant on the computer screen
of the Kay Elemetrics Swallowing Workstation (Model
7100, Kay Pentax) and were used as biofeedback, giving
participants specific goals for successful task completion
(see Figure 3). The task was practiced until five out of five
trials were successfully completed. Success was defined as
elevation of the submental sEMG signal for a minimum
of 2 s (Ding et al., 2002). Scripted directions for the effortful swallow were as follows: "As you swallow, squeeze hard
with all of your throat and neck muscles" (Logemann,
1999). sEMG signals were used once again as biofeedback
(see Figure 3). The task was practiced until five out of five
trials were successfully completed. Success was defined
as a doubling in sEMG amplitude as compared with normal sEMG amplitudes (Huckabee et al., 2005). Task success for both the Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful
swallow took, on average, from 5 to 7 min per participant.

Surface EMG Data Collection
The sEMG signals were obtained from a single,
3-point, circular disposable electrode with a 2.25-in. diameter during task practice, as described previously, as

well as during the videofluoroscopic portion of the experiment. Each patch contained a triad of three electrodes;
two were recording electrodes and one a ground. Interelectrode distance was 0.25 in. edge to edge and 0.75 in.
center to center. The skin under the chin was cleansed
with alcohol swabs prior to electrode placement. Electrode patch placement was determined by having participants press their tongues to the top of their mouths
with force during which palpation by the investigator
helped to identify the submental muscle group. The patch
was then placed at midline in the submental region, approximately 0.50 in. posterior from the anterior, inferior
midline of the mandible, with adjustments made for
anatomic variability among participants. The two recording electrodes were placed to the left and right of midline,
with the ground electrode oriented posteriorly. The sEMG
signals were recorded and processed by the Kay Swallow
Signals Lab (Kay Pentax) that was coupled to the Kay
Elemetrics Swallowing Workstation (Model 7100, Kay
Pentax). Signals were sampled at a rate of 500 Hz. The
raw signal was bandpass filtered (50-250 Hz), integrated
(time constant = 50 ms), and rectified.

Videofluoroscopic Procedure
Videofluoroscopic studies of each task were recorded
with a resolution of 30 frames per second to the Kay
Digital Swallowing Workstation from a properly collimated Phillips Radiographic / Fluoroscopic unit that
provided a 63-kW, 1.2-, A-type output for full field-ofview mode. Participants were positioned in the lateral
viewing plane sitting upright. They performed three
trials of the EMST task and self-administered three
trials of 10-mL thin liquid barium contrasted solution

( Varibar contrast agents; EZ-EM, Inc.) per graded medicine cup for each swallow task (normal, Mendelsohn,
and effortful). For the EMST task, the fluoroscope was
activated prior to the introduction of the trainer's mouthpiece into the participant's mouth and remained activated for 2 s after the device was removed from the
oral cavity. For the swallow tasks, participants were instructed to take the material into the mouth and stabilize the head (in case of neck flexion during bolus
introduction into the oral cavity) in order to minimize
movement artifact when measuring hyoid trajectory.
Once the head was stabilized, they were told to swallow
when ready. The fluoroscope was activated prior to the
self-administration of the contrast material into the oral
cavity and remained activated for 2 s after the bolus tail
exited the UES to allow complete extent of the hyoid
movement to be captured. The resulting videofluoroscopic
images and sEMG data were integrated within the Kay
Swallowing Workstation, which allowed for postacquisition concurrent analysis of the data (see Figure 4).

Data Analysis
Participant Task Performance
Although correct performance of the experimental
tasks was documented prior to beginning the experiment

(described earlier), correct performances of the effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuver during the
experiment were also checked post hoc by having two
independent raters and the first author score the maneuvers from both the sEMG signal and videoflouroscopic images. For the Mendelsohn maneuver, a score of
1.00 indicated correct performance of a task, 0.50 indicated the task was partially correct, and 0.00 indicated
the participant was unable to correctly perform the task
according to specified criteria (see Table 2). For the effortful swallow, a score of 1.00 was assigned for correct
performance, and 0.00 was assigned for inability to correctly complete the task (see Table 2).

Measures
sEMG. A baseline sEMG measure was taken from
the middle 500 ms of an initial 30-s period of quiet
breathing. To obtain sEMG onset and offset points associated with hyoid motion during each experimental
task, the videofluorographic images were tagged for task
onset. For the EMST task, onset was defined as the point
where the device was situated within the oral cavity. For
the normal swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver, and effortful swallow tasks, onset was defined as the point where
the head of the bolus began posterior movement in the
oral cavity resulting in the pharyngeal phase of the

swallow (see Figure 4). Task onsets were subsequently
referred to as T0, which served as the starting point for
each task to which subsequent temporal characteristics were referenced. Thus, onset of sEMG activity was
defined based on departure of the sEMG signal from a
resting baseline level associated specifically with biomechanical events occurring on the fluoroscopic image
indicative of the beginning of each task (see Figure 4).
Likewise, sEMG offset was defined as a return of the
sEMG trace to resting level that coincided with task
completion. The image frames during the swallow were

tagged for the point of maximum hyoid excursion and for
hyoid return to rest after task completion. These points
were then identified on the sEMG trace and the corresponding sEMG amplitude was recorded. Measures of
peak amplitude and average amplitude were also obtained between T0 and task completion. As well, the duration of submental muscle activation during each task
was determined by measuring the interval between the
onset and the offset (offset time minus onset time) of
submental muscle activity during each task ( between
T0 and task completion (Crary et al., 2006; Ding et al.,
2002).

maneuver and effortful swallow.

Each sEMG measure was normalized to the maximum EMG signal recorded for the effortful swallow task
(which represented the task emphasizing greatest effort
generated by a participant). Surface EMG measures
were chosen based on the biomechanical events of interest (discussed next), which were identified from the
videoflouroscopic images. They included the following:

Hyoid trajectory measures. Traditionally, hyoid movement during a swallow has been described in terms of
vertical or anterior movement components. A problem of
this manner of hyoid measurement is that data are relatively inconsistent in their ability to discern "normal"
versus "abnormal" swallows that are due to a considerable amount of variability in hyoid movement within the
general population (e.g., Paik et al., 2008). Therefore, the
Laryngeal Function Laboratory at the University of
Florida developed a MATLAB routine in order to quantify the trajectory of hyoid motion during a swallow
(Wheeler, Martin-Harris, Brodsky, Thekkevalappil, &
Sapienza, 2006). This program provides measures of the

To use the MATLAB routine, individual JPEG images of the swallow were extracted from the Kay recording device using the ImagePro Plus program ( Media
Cybernetics). The image sequences consisted of all frames
from T0 to task completion as tagged on the Kay Swallow
Station in order to maintain the integrity of temporal
relations between the sEMG signal and hyoid movement
measures (described next). Once extracted, the files were
transferred to a computer (Dell OptiPlex GX 280, Dell,
Inc.) equipped with MATLAB Version 7.0.1 (The MathWorks, Inc.). The MATLAB swallow routine tracks the
hyoid motion using the third cervical C3 as a reference. To
measure the angle of hyoid elevation, the program uses
the first frame in the sequence as a reference line (between the hyoid bone and C3), and hyoid movement
subsequent to that frame is referenced to the line from C3
(see Figure 5). All frames subsequent to the first frame

were randomized by the program and then presented to
the user for data analysis. The most anterior and inferior
points on the hyoid bone and on C3 were identified for all
frames of measurement by the measurer (the first author).
After measurement of the randomized swallow frames was
completed, the software routine calculated the displacement and angle of the hyoid bone relative to the initial
resting position for each frame of the swallow, generating these calculations in Microsoft Excel ( Windows XP).
Displacement measures represent the distance (in millimeters) between C3 and the hyoid bone. Angle measures
represent the angle (in degrees) of hyoid elevation, relative to the reference line from the first frame of the task.

seconds, converted to milliseconds) at which each displacement and angle measure occurred. For example,
suppose a task begins at time ( T0) = 1:15.805 (1 min,
15 and 0.805 s). If the time of the maximum sEMG
( TMax EMG) or a task was 1:16.065, it occurred 260 ms
(1:16.065-1:15.805) after T0. If the time of maximum
hyoid displacement ( D1) occurred at the 11th frame of
the sequence (as reported by the trajectory program), it
occurred 367 ms (11 x [1/30] = 0.367 s = 367 ms) after T0.
Thus, both time measures are referenced to a common
starting point, and it is possible to calculate that D1
occurred 117 ms (367-260) after TMax EMG.

The points of maximum displacement and maximum angle were identified from the data in the Excel
files for each participant across the three trials of each
task, yielding the following measures:

Displacement measures were normalized for each
participant across the first frame of each task in order to
allow for interparticipant comparison. As well, the time
in milliseconds was calculated for each measure ( T1, T2,
and T3, respectively). These were the points that were
chosen to quantify the most salient characteristics of hyoid
bone movement: how much excursion (displacement),
how much vertical elevation (angle), and when these
events occurred within each task relative to submental
muscle activation.

Temporal Alignment of sEMG
and Trajectory Measures
sEMG measures were made directly from the Kay
Swallow station, and measures of hyoid trajectory were
made based on images extracted from the Kay station
and uploaded into our MATLAB routine. Therefore, temporal calculations were necessary in order to analyze the
relation between these measures. As described earlier,
T0 was identified and tagged as the onset of each task.
For sEMG measures, time recordings (in milliseconds)
were simply made relative to T0. For the trajectory
analysis, images were extracted starting at the T0 point,
at a rate of 30 frames per second (1 frame every 1 /30 s).
It was subsequently possible to calculate the time (in

Statistical analysis of the data was completed using
the SPSS software Version 11.5. To assess task-related
differences in the hyoid bone movement pattern, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
completed including the within-participant variables
task and between-participant variables of sex and task
performance. For trajectory measures A1, D1, A2, D2,
A3, and D3, significance was set at p = .008 ( Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons: .05/6 = .008).
Task differences in submental sEMG measures were
examined using a repeated measures ANOVA with the
within-participant variable task and between-participant
variable sex and task performance. A significance level
of p < .012 was set ( Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons: .05/4 = .012). Post hoc analyses were then
completed using pairwise comparisons in order to identify which task trajectory and sEMG measures were significantly different when significant effects of task were
identified. Further analyses using Pearson r correlations
and paired sample t tests were completed on hyoid displacement and angle measures as well as sEMG measures
in order to determine relations between the magnitude and
timing of hyoid movement and submental muscle activity.

Results
Means and standard deviations for each of the
sEMG and trajectory measures are in Table 3. Intrarater
and interrater reliability was completed on 15% of the
dataset using Pearson r correlations. Intrarater reliability ranged from r = .823 to .945. Interrater reliability
ranged from r = .872 to .949, with the exception of T2
(time of maximum hyoid angle), where r = .642. Paired
sample t tests indicated nonsignificant differences for
both inter- and intrarater reliability measures.

criteria (see Table 2) for successful participant task performance. All participants were able to successfully perform the effortful swallow. However, 24% (4 women and
2 men) of participants were only able to partially (score
of 0.50) perform the Mendelsohn maneuver (see Table 1).
To determine whether there were differences due to
ability to correctly or partially perform the Mendelsohn
maneuver, task performance was included as a betweenparticipant variable in the ANOVA analyses (see next
section). One of the 25 participants, a 23-year-old woman,
was unable to perform the Mendelsohn maneuver correctly, with no prolongation of hyoid elevation seen on
videofluoroscopy and no prolonged submental muscle activation evident from the sEMG signal. That participant's
data were omitted from analysis.

Trajectory Differences Between
Experimental Tasks
There was no significant effect found for sex,
F(6, 195) = 2.350, p = .084, task performance, F(6, 195) =
2.09, p = .116, or an interaction between sex and task
performance, F(6, 195) = 0.577, p = .743. Data were then
collapsed across sex and task performance, and the
analysis was rerun. A significant effect was found for
task, F(18, 17) = 17.594, p = .001. The following trajectory variables were found to be significantly different across task: maximum displacement ( D1), F(3, 1) =
120.140, p < .000; maximum angle (A2), F(3, 1) = 4.959,
p = .004; and displacement associated with the maximum angle ( D2), F(3, 1) = 27.761, p < .000.

A post hoc analysis with the independent variable
task and dependent variables D1, A2, and D2 was then
completed in order to examine which tasks differed significantly from each other on these measures (see Table 4,
Figure 6). The three tasks that included an actual swallow
(e.g., normal swallow task, Mendelsohn maneuver, and effortful swallow) did not differ significantly from each other
in the maximum displacement of hyoid movement (D1)
or in displacement associated with maximum angle (D2),
whereas EMST was significantly different, with overall
shorter D1 and D2 than the other tasks. For the measure
of maximum angle (A2), A2 was significantly lower for
the normal swallow task than the Mendelsohn maneuver.

sEMG Related to Hyoid Movement
There was no significant effect found for sex,
F(5, 195) = 4.671, p = .010; task performance, F(5, 195) =
2.509, p = .080; or an interaction between sex and task
performance, F(5, 195) = 2.457, p = .085. Data were subsequently collapsed across sex and task performance, and
were reanalyzed. A significant effect occurred for task,
F(12, 11) = 97.930, p < .000, for each of the sEMG measures, including maximum sEMG ( Max EMG), F(3, 1) =
18.773, p < .000; average sEMG (Avg EMG), F(3, 1) =
12.121, p < .000; sEMG level at onset of hyoid movement ( HStart EMG), F(3, 1) = 25.265, p < .000; and
sEMG level at maximum hyoid movement (HMax EMG),
F(3, 1) = 24.373, p < .000.

all tasks except between the Mendelsohn maneuver and
the effortful swallow, which were both significantly higher
than either EMST or normal swallow tasks. The normal
swallow task had the lowest maximum sEMG measure,
which was significantly lower than all other tasks. Average
sEMG was also significantly lower for the normal swallow versus that of the other tasks (which were not
significantly different from each other). The sEMG signal
at the start of hyoid movement (HStart EMG) was not
significantly different between the normal swallow task
and the EMST task, or between the Mendelsohn maneuver and the effortful swallow task. More specifically,
both the Mendelsohn maneuver and the effortful swallow had higher HStart EMG measures than either the
normal swallow task or the EMST task. Lastly, the sEMG
at maximum hyoid movement (HMax EMG) was not significantly different between the normal swallow task and

the EMST task, but was different for all other task
pairings such that the Mendelsohn maneuver and the
effortful swallow had significantly higher HMax EMG
values than the normal swallow and the EMST tasks.
Furthermore, the effortful swallow had an HMax
EMG value that was also significantly higher than the
Mendelsohn maneuver (see Table 4 and Figure 6).
A Pearson r correlation analysis was completed on
maximum sEMG ( Max EMG), maximum hyoid displacement ( D1), and maximum angle of elevation (A2). No
significant correlations were found between any of these
variables. A partial correlation analysis controlling for
task was then completed to determine if there was a correlation between these variables, controlling for task.
Significant positive partial correlations were found between A2 and D1 (r = .400, p < .01) and between D1 and
maximum EMG measures (r = .402, p < .01).

Paired sample t tests and Pearson r correlations were
completed to determine if there were significant differences between the timing of the maximum sEMG signal
(TMax EMG) and times of hyoid maximum displacement
(T1) and hyoid maximum angle (T2) for each of the tasks
and if significant correlations existed between these
measures. Results, which are summarized in Table 5,
indicated strong positive correlations and significant differences between measures of T1, T2, and TMax EMG
for the normal swallow task. However, for each subsequent task, the nature of these relations changed such
that the strength of correlations between timings generally decreased, with the exception of T1 and TMax
EMG on the effortful swallow (r = .762, p < .000), and T2
and TMax EMG on the EMST task (r = .804, p < .000).
Additionally, significant differences disappeared with
tasks other than the normal swallow with the exceptions
of T2 and TMax EMG for the Mendelsohn maneuver,

maneuver) had greater hyoid displacement values than
the EMST task. The maximum angle of hyoid elevation
was significantly lower for the normal swallow task than
for the Mendelsohn maneuver. sEMG measures were
generally highest for the Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful swallows, with the effortful swallow achieving the
highest sEMG values, particularly at the point of hyoid
maximum displacement. As well, each task presented
with different relations between the timing of hyoid
angle and displacement measures and the time of maximum sEMG values, each of which is explained next.
Compensatory rehabilitation techniques and maneuvers aimed at actively changing the physiology of the
swallow, and thus improving swallow safety, are some
common strategies used clinically for treating dysphagia
following neurologic or anatomical injury (Clark, 2003;
Logemann, 1998). Specifically, the Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful swallow are known to modify hyoid bone
movement and increase the activation of the submental
muscle group when compared with a normal swallow task
(Ding et al., 2002; Hind et al., 2001; Huckabee et al.,
2005). Although less common than other tools used in
swallow rehabilitation, the EMST device is similar to an
effortful swallow or Mendelsohn maneuver in that it also
increases and prolongs submental muscle activity as compared with normal swallows (Wheeler et al., 2007). Because of the important role the submental musculature
plays in the movements of the hyolaryngeal complex,
any rehabilitation program that targets that muscle
group according to the principles of task specificity and
overload would be desirable in order to capitalize on the
neural and myogenic adaptations that occur with use
and training. Results of this study suggest differential
effects of each experimental task with regards to the
principles of task specificity and overload.

Discussion
This study investigated the concurrent biomechanical and electromyographic properties of the effortful
swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver, and EMST tasks in
order to define the impact of each on hyoid movements
and submental muscle activity. The overall goal of this
work was to characterize the task-specific and overload
properties of each task. It was hypothesized that the
trajectory of hyoid movement, submental sEMG measures, and relation between hyoid movement and submental sEMG would exhibit discrete differences when
measured concurrently for each of the normal swallows
(control task), effortful swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver,
and EMST tasks. Study results supported the hypotheses. Significant differences were found between tasks
for the measures of hyoid displacement and angle. The
three tasks that included an actual swallow (e.g., normal swallow task, effortful swallow, and Mendelsohn

of a previously familiar task indicates that functional
improvement may be best achieved via task-specific
exercises (Hamdy et al., 1998; Kleim et al., 2002). Task
specificity in the current project was defined according to
hyoid movement measures and sEMG relations. Measures of maximum hyoid displacement did not differ
significantly between the normal swallows, Mendelsohn
maneuver, and effortful swallow; however, the displacement was less for the EMST task versus the other tasks.
It has been previously demonstrated that varying the
size of the bolus results in different measures of hyoid displacement (Ertekin et al., 1997; Leonard et al., 2000). In
the present study, bolus volume was consistent between
tasks (10 mL). Hence, the lack of displacement differences
between the normal swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver,
and effortful swallow are not surprising. Although the
contractile (sEMG) and temporal relations between biomechanical events may be altered by executing the
volitional swallow exercise tasks, the resulting displacement of the hyoid bone is preserved. This may be due to
anatomic or physiologic constraints such that the hyoid
bone is only able to move a given amount, and increasing
the force generated by the primary mover muscles is not
going to increase movement, at least not in an already
healthy swallow.
The angle of hyoid displacement was significantly
higher for the Mendelsohn maneuver versus the normal
swallow. Although it did not achieve statistical significance, the angle of hyoid displacement was also generally higher for the effortful swallow and the EMST task
versus the normal swallow (see Figure 6). This indicates
that the hyoid bone was achieving a larger vertical
movement with the experimental tasks relative to the
normal swallows. The angle of elevation during a normal
swallowing task remains constant within and between
individuals, indicating that a specific amount of elevation relative to the hyoid starting point at onset of pharyngeal swallow is associated with a healthy swallow
(Wheeler et al., 2006). It has been suggested that
vertical motion of the hyoid bone is primarily related to
oral bolus manipulation, and anterior movement is associated with the pharyngeal swallow (Ishida, Palmer,
& Hiiemae, 2002). In the present study, the measures of
hyoid motion for the swallow tasks were made at the
onset of bolus posterior movement in the oral cavity
such that there was not extraneous movement of the
hyoid bone associated with oral bolus manipulation at
that point in the swallow (this movement had already
occurred). As such, the specific increase in vertical hyoid
motion in these cases is associated with pharyngeal
swallow. Vertical hyoid motion is important with regard
to the ability to raise the hyolaryngeal complex and tuck
it forward as the bolus passes through the pharynx.
Additionally, it was found that the submental sEMG
activity associated with the onset of hyoid movement

1084

( HStart EMG) and the point of maximum hyoid displacement ( HMax EMG) was greatest for the effortful
swallow, followed by the Mendelsohn maneuver, and
lastly the normal swallow and EMST task (which were
not significantly different from each other; see Table 4).
Although surface measures of electromyographic activity may not be sensitive enough to reflect the true activities from each muscle or section of muscle from the
group, the consistent recording placement during the
experiment on each individual participant produced significantly different sEMG measures between tasks.
Thus, results suggest that for the effortful swallow and
Mendelsohn maneuver, submental muscle activity is
greater at task onset and maintained to the point of
maximum hyoid displacement versus lower onset levels
exhibited by the normal swallow and EMST task. This
finding is further substantiated by previous reports of
pretask hyoid elevation, which would logically be
associated with increased submental sEMG activation
at task initiation, for both the Mendelsohn maneuver
and effortful swallow (Bulow et al., 1999; Hind et al.,
2001; Huckabee et al., 2005). The absolute maximum
sEMG ( Max EMG) with the EMST task was not significantly different from the effortful swallow or Mendelsohn
maneuver, with all three being significantly greater than
the normal swallow.
The relations between the times of maximum sEMG
amplitude ( TMax EMG), maximum hyoid displacement
( T1), and maximum hyoid angle of elevation ( T2) were
also different between the swallow tasks. With the normal swallow task, the sequence generally occurred with
TMax EMG first, followed by T2 and then T1. Each
resulted in high positive correlations, suggesting that
they maintained the integrity of that relation in time
such that if TMax EMG occurred later in the task, so did
T2 and T1, respectively. With the Mendelsohn maneuver, T1 occurred closely in time with TMax EMG, and T2
occurred later in the task than T1 or TMax EMG. During
the effortful swallow, T1 occurred later than T2 or TMax
EMG, which were not significantly different in their
time of occurrence. Effortful swallow patterns are similar to those produced in the normal swallow condition.
Preservation of this relation, along with similar maximum hyoid displacement measures, indicates that with
regard to task specificity, the effortful swallow is the
most task specific.
Findings related to the EMST task indicated a
difference in hyoid trajectory such that the maximum
displacement achieved by the hyoid bone was significantly less than each of the swallow tasks. In fact, both
the maximum displacement ( D1) and the displacement
associated with maximum angle ( D2) were significantly
less in the EMST task. Post hoc observation of the
patterns of motion exhibited under fluoroscopy during

findings: The hyoid bone moved superiorly as the participant initiated expiratory airflow while using the device, and returned to a rest position at task completion, a
movement pattern that was not observed to contain an
anterior component (see Figure 7). The superior movement accounts for the increased angle of elevation (A2)
compared with the normal swallow task, and the lack of
anterior movement explains the significantly smaller displacements. As well, the temporal relations between hyoid
movement and submental EMG were different than
those associated with a normal swallow task. They were
not significantly different between TMax EMG and T1 or
T2 according to paired sample t tests; significant positive
correlations existed between all three measures. This
indicates that as one measure occurs later during the
task, the other two do, as well. Although these events occur in a given time interval within the EMST task, they
do not necessarily occur in a particular order. This is in
contrast to the normal swallow, effortful swallow, and
Mendelsohn maneuver, in which the timings of each
occurred in a specific order whose temporal relation was

maintained within the task, suggesting physiologic interdependence of those events. Because the EMST task
was not associated with an actual swallow, that swallowspecific physiologic interdependence was not present.
This is not to suggest a lack of relation between the
variables; in fact, there were moderate-to-strong positive correlations between TMax EMG, T1, and T2 for the
EMST task. It simply means the nature of the relation is
different and that EMST lacks the task specificity that
both the Mendelsohn maneuver and the effortful swallow inherently possess.

The Principle of Overload
The principle of overload dictates that in order for a
muscle to experience strength gains, it must be taxed
beyond its present capacity to respond; an example of
this would be doing bicep curls using hand weights. The
weights increase the load placed on the muscle, which
over time will lead to neural and myogenic adaptations
manifesting as greater force-generating capacity of the
muscle. This is very important when considering the effect of an exercise program in which increasing the
strength of a muscle, or muscles, for a given task is
the desired outcome. Findings of this study indicate that
the normal swallow exhibited significantly smaller average and maximum sEMG measures versus the
Mendelsohn maneuver, effortful swallow, or EMST task.
These findings are congruent with prior studies, which
have demonstrated that each of the latter three tasks
are associated with sEMG recordings from the submental muscles that are at least 1.5 times greater than activation acquired during a normal swallow (Ding et al.,
2002; Hind et al., 2001; Huckabee et al., 2005; Wheeler
et al., 2007). These findings indicate that submental
muscles are being taxed beyond the capacity with which
they would normally respond (during normal swallows)
in order to successfully perform the exercise tasks. However, the nature of the load (e.g., volitional vs. physiologic) for the tasks was different. With the Mendelsohn
maneuver and effortful swallow, the load imposed was
volitional. That is, the submental muscle activity found
to increase on sEMG resulted from the intention of the
participant to "squeeze" those muscles, or to "swallow
hard." Conversely, the load imposed by EMST results
from an externally imposed threshold that must be overcome in order to break the spring-loaded valve and allow
air to flow through the device.
As was previously reported by Wheeler and colleagues
(2007), and again found in this study, EMST achieved
higher maximum and average submental sEMG activity
versus normal swallowing. Because surface EMG recording was utilized, and that signal is unable to discern the contribution of individual muscles within the
submental group, it cannot be concluded based on these

data the nature of activation differences within the
muscles for each task. However, differences in hyoid
bone movement between the EMST task and other tasks
(smaller displacements, increased angle of elevation vs.
normal swallows) suggest that the physiologic correlate
for increased submental sEMG activation in the case of
EMST is vertical hyoid movement. As such, it may be
that the EMST device stimulates enhanced neural drive
to a component(s) of the submental muscle complex in a
manner that is different than the swallow tasks. Therefore, results suggest that EMST has potential to induce
strength gains in the submental muscles secondary to
the externally imposed load. This may eventually lead to
an effect on the swallow at both the point of initiation of
bolus propulsion into the pharynx and hyoid excursion
leading to airway protective mechanisms (events that are
dependent on submental muscle contraction). However,
the impact of EMST on swallowing needs further investigation in the form of more precise EMG investigation techniques and pre-post training measures in order to more
correctly speak to its impact on the swallow mechanism.

Conclusion
Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms can lead to the
observed symptoms of dysphagia, including stroke, degenerative neurologic or neuromuscular disease, respiratory
disease, or cancer in the head and neck. This study included three experimental tasks, including the Mendelsohn
maneuver, effortful swallow, and EMST task, and demonstrated differential effects of each on task specificity and
overload, which are important for rehabilitation. Future
research investigating the longitudinal changes that occur
both peripherally and centrally following prescribed exercise programs would be of interest. These studies would
provide insight as to adaptations or modulations that
may occur functionally and /or at the level of the central
nervous system over time in health and disease.
