Abstract
In natural production, adults differentiate homophones prosodically as a function of the frequency
of their intended meaning. This study compares adult and child productions of homophones
to determine whether prosodic differentiation of homophones changes over development.
Using a picture-based story-completion paradigm, isolated tokens of homophones were elicited
from English-learning children and adult native English speakers. These tokens were measured
for duration, vowel duration, pitch, pitch range, and vowel quality. Results indicate that less
frequent meanings of homophones are longer in duration than their more frequent counterparts
in both adults and children. No other measurement differed as a function of meaning frequency.
As speakers of all ages produce longer tokens of lower frequency homophones, homophone
differentiation does not change over development, but is included in children's early lexicons. These
findings indicate that production planning processes alone may not fully account for differences
in homophone duration, but rather that the differences could be learned and represented from
experience even in the early stages of lexical acquisition.

1 Introduction
One challenge to children as they learn the words of their first language(s) is that the referential
problem (i.e., what entity a given word refers to) is very ambiguous. In any natural word learning
context, the number of potential referents for an unfamiliar word is large and yet children attach
words to appropriate referents as young as six months of age (Bergelson & Swingley, 2015). To
account for this rapid learning, theories of lexical acquisition tend to posit that children are equipped
with a set of word learning constraints or principles that allow them to narrow the possible range
of word meanings and reduce referential ambiguity. In nearly every account of word learning, one
of these constraints is the assumption that each word will have a single referent and each referent
will have a single word, an assumption referred to as one-form/one-function (Slobin, 1973), the

taxonomic constraint (Markman, 1990), or mutual exclusivity (Markman & Wachtel, 1988), among
other terms. This assumption works well for many of the words that children are likely to encounter, but it fails to address how children learn words that do not conform to this expectation, such as
homophones.
Homophones, words that have two or more distinct meanings, should be particularly problematic for word learners who assume that every word has a single referent. When learners who make
that assumption encounter a familiar word, what would motivate them to entertain the possibility
that it might have a second meaning? Indeed, in lab tasks, children struggle to assign a novel meaning to a familiar word (Beveridge & Marsh, 1991; Doherty, 2004; Mazzocco, 1997; but see Storkel
& Maekawa, 2005, for an important exception), although they can succeed with sufficient syntactic
or semantic support for meaning differentiation (Backscheider, Gelman, Martinez & Kowieski,
1999; Casenhiser, 2005; Dautriche, Fibla & Christophe, 2015). It is not the case, however, that
homophones are absent from children's early language experience or from their vocabularies.
Parents use homophones when speaking to children (Nelson, 1995; Conwell & Morgan, 2012) and
children's early vocabularies do contain homophone pairs (Backscheider & Gelman, 1995; Conwell
& Morgan, 2012). In spite of violating the one-to-one mapping assumption, homophones do not
appear to pose a particular problem to children in natural language learning settings. Because children succeed at learning homophones in natural settings but not in lab settings, natural learning
environments must contain information that supports homophone learning, possibly by differentiating homophone meanings in a way that indicates to language learners that a second meaning
should be considered for a known word.
A growing body of research suggests that one way in which homophones might be disambiguated is through consistent prosodic differences in their production as a function of the intended
meaning. In studies of adult-directed speech, adults use duration as a disambiguating feature in
their homophone production, with more frequent homophone meanings exhibiting shorter durations than their less frequent counterparts. These effects were first reported in reading tasks (Cohn,
Brugman, Crawford & Joseph, 2005; Guion, 1995; Whalen, 1991), although some of those studies
reported durational differences only in sentence-medial position and not in generic carrier phrases
(Guion, 1995), while others found that contrastive use and sentence-final prosody to be necessary
for eliciting durational differences in homophones (Cohn, et al., 2005). Reading tasks allow
researchers to control for many factors that may affect production, such as sentence position, but
the prosody of read speech is distinct from that of natural speech (Howell & Kadi-Hanifi, 1991).
However, studies of natural speech corpora also suggest that homophones may be acoustically
distinct as a function of meaning frequency. Jurafsky, Bell, and Girard (2002) examined four function words with multiple meanings in a large corpus of adult-directed English and found that only
some of them showed consistent durational differences as a function of meaning frequency.
However, in a corpus study that included all homophones in the corpus, Gahl (2008) reported
longer durations for lower frequency homophones, even when speech rate, syntactic category,
predictability, and orthography were controlled for. Beyond durational cues, adults use vowel neutralization and syllabic stress as a cue to homophone meaning in disyllabic homophones (Kelly,
1992; Kelly & Bock, 1988; Sereno & Jongman, 1995) and lexical frequency also affects vowel
dispersion (Munson & Solomon, 2004).
As the prosody of child-directed speech is somewhat exaggerated relative to that of adultdirected speech (Bernstein Ratner, 1984; Ferguson, 1964; Fernald, 1989), further work has examined whether the same effects are seen in speech to children. In a corpus study of child-directed
speech, Conwell (2017a) reported that adults differentiate homophone meanings as a function of
frequency when speaking to children, but only in utterance-final positions, which is consistent with
the findings from Cohn and colleagues (2005). Additionally, Conwell (2017a) found that higher

468

Language and Speech 61(3)

frequency homophone meanings in child-directed speech had higher mean pitch than their lower
frequency counterparts. Child-directed speech also contains exaggerated vowel spaces for verb
tokens of noun/verb homophones (Conwell & Morgan, 2012; Conwell, 2017b), but does not appear
to show vowel space differences related to meaning frequency for homophones more generally
(Conwell, 2017a).
Taken together, the previous research on acoustic distinctions between homophone meanings
suggests differentiation of homophone meanings as a function of the frequency of the intended
meaning in both child-directed and adult-directed English. Such differences may support the disambiguation of homophone meaning by young word learners by allowing them to maintain separate phonetic representations for each homophone meaning, thus removing the need to violate the
one-to-one mapping principle to learn homophones and providing motivation to consider that a
familiar phonemic sequence might have a second meaning. In other words, if children actually
have two distinct phonetic forms for flower and flour, then they may be able to associate one meaning (e.g., a blossom) with one phonetic form and another meaning (e.g., a grain product) with the
other. Indeed, Gahl (2008) proposed that adults have separate phonetic forms for homophones,
each associated with a distinct meaning. Those distinct forms must have been acquired at some
point during development. Children may create distinct phonetic entries for homophones based on
their experience and maintain them over their lifespan, which would not only facilitate acquisition
of such words, but would also reduce the effects of lexical ambiguity on sentence processing
through adulthood. Evidence from studies of noun/verb homophones suggests that infants can
perceive the acoustic differences that exist in some homophone pairs (Conwell & Morgan, 2012)
and adults show different neural responses to isolated noun tokens and verb tokens of noun/verb
homophones in an event-related potential paradigm with electroencephalography (Conwell, 2015).
Although there is evidence that listeners can perceive some of the acoustic cues that distinguish
homophone meanings, the issue of whether children incorporate those distinctions into their own
productions of homophones remains unaddressed. Corpora of child speech for which audio recordings are available do not contain enough child-produced homophone tokens to address this question and preschool-aged children cannot participate in reading studies. Therefore, an elicitation
paradigm is needed to obtain evidence on whether and how children distinguish homophones in
their own speech. Elicitation also mitigates the effects of speaking rate, syntax, and referential
context that might influence spontaneous productions.
The present study asks whether children produce the same distinctions in homophones that
adults do. The analysis examines a range of acoustic features that might vary between productions
of the same word form: duration, vowel duration, mean pitch, pitch range, and vowel quality, while
many previous studies have examined only duration. Adults are expected to differentiate homophone meanings as a function of lemma frequency using duration, pitch, and vowel formant cues.
If children fully incorporate those differences into their lexical representations of homophones,
then they should show the same patterns of differentiation as adults. However, children's developing lexical and phonological representations may result in a pattern of homophone production that
is not adult-like.

2 Method
2.1 Stimuli
The stimuli for this study comprised 22 brief stories (3-4 sentences each). Stories were presented
one sentence at a time with accompanying illustrations to support production of the target word
(Figure 1). Sixteen of the stories could be completed with a homophone from one of four

butter, eggs and chocolate chips. He is forgetting one very important thing. There it is! There's the
________." (Target: flour).

homophone pairs (flower/flour; plane/plain; red/read; whole/hole). Each homophonous meaning
could felicitously complete two of the stories. The illustrations were printed in full color on cardstock and the stories were produced by the experimenter. The other six stories were used as practice
trials and filler trials. The appendix includes the full text of the stories.
For each homophone pair in this study, one meaning was more frequent in child-directed speech
than the other. The relative frequency of homophone meanings was based on the total number of
adult uses in the Providence Corpus, which consists of approximately 360 hours of speech between
parents and children (Demuth, Culbertson & Alter, 2006). The more frequent targets were flower,
plane, red, and whole, while flour, plain, read, and hole were less frequent than their counterparts.
For read, a heteronym, the frequency of the target /d/ (as opposed to the non-target /id/) was
determined by hand-counting occurrences of each pronunciation.

2.2 Participants
Child participants were 68 English-learning children ages 4 years, 11 months to 6 years, 11 months
(mean age: 5 years, 9 months). One child was not included in the analysis due to documented
speech delays. Eight children (five male; three female) did not produce both meanings of any of the
homophone pairs; their data were also excluded from analysis. The final sample included 59 child
participants (21 male; 38 female). Parental consent to participate was obtained for all child participants prior to the study. All children received a book upon completing the study to thank them for
their participation.
Adult participants were 35 monolingual native speakers of American English, 12 male and 23
female. All adult participants who were included in the analysis had lived the majority of their lives
in the north-central region of the United States and spoke the dialect of English associated with that
region. Six additional participants completed the study, but were excluded from the analysis for
having non-regional dialects that affected vowel categories. All adult participants received course
credit for their participation.

2.3 Procedure
All participants were seated in front of a Blue Snowball USB microphone connected to a laptop
computer. The experimenter sat across the table from the participant with the story illustrations.
The stories were presented in random order across participants. The experimenter displayed one
illustration at a time and read the corresponding sentence before setting the illustration aside.
Participants were instructed to produce the word they thought best completed the story. Sentences
were not repeated. Adult participants were not prompted to produce alternate words if they did not

470

Language and Speech 61(3)

produce the target on their first attempt. When child participants did not produce the target word
on the first try, they were prompted once to produce an alternative, using the phrase "Can you think
of another way to say that?" If children did not produce the target word after one use of this prompt,
the experimenter moved on to the next set of illustrations. At no point during the experimental session did the experimenter produce any of the target words. The session was recorded continuously
using the Audacity program (Audacity, 2014).

2.4 Measurement
All productions of target words were extracted from the recordings and analyzed using PRAAT
(Boersma & Weenink, 2014). Trained research assistants placed boundaries at the beginning and
end of each word as well as at the beginning and end of the vowel. These boundaries were placed
based on auditory characteristics as well as on visual examination of the spectrogram and waveform. A PRAAT script was used to extract token duration, vowel duration, pitch characteristics
(mean, minimum and maximum), and the first and second formant frequencies at the midpoint of
the vowel, as well as at 20% of the vowel and 80% of the vowel. Pitch range was computed in
semitones using the minimum and maximum measurements. Static formant measures reported
here were taken at the midpoint of the vowel.
Following Ferguson and Kewley-Port (2007), the formant measures from 20% and 80% of the
vowel were converted to Barks and used to calculate two dynamic measures of vowel quality that
are associated with clear speech: spectral change () and spectral angle (). Spectral change ()
describes the amount of formant movement that occurs during the middle 60% of the vowel. It was
calculated as  = F180 - F120 + F 280 - F 220 .
Spectral angle () describes the rate of change of the vowel formants by characterizing the angle of
the vowel spectra in radians. It is calculated by adding the absolute values of the angles of the first and
second vowel formants, which were computed as

 Fn - Fn20
 n = arctan  80
d



 , where


time80 - time20
.
100
These dynamic vowel measures provide some indication of how clearly articulated the vowels
are, as larger  and larger  are both associated with speech that was intended by the speaker to
be very clear (Ferguson & Kewley-Port, 2002; Ferguson & Kewley-Port, 2007). Larger values for
both measures additionally predict vowel intelligibility (Hillenbrand & Nearey, 1999). Therefore,
the prediction is that, if speakers exaggerate lower frequency meanings of a homophone with the
intent of producing clearer exemplars of those words, the lower frequency meanings should have
larger  and .
In addition to measures of the tokens themselves, two variables were calculated and included in
the model to control for variables known to affect the duration of words. As speaking rate has been
reported to influence duration of words (Bell, et al., 2003; Cohn, et al., 2005), the rate at which the
experimenter produced the story prior to the target word was calculated for every trial by measuring from the onset of the experimenter's speech to the offset of the experimenter's speech and then
dividing that time by the number of syllables in that trial. Predictability, specifically bigram probability, can also affect word duration (Gahl, 2008; Jurafsky, et al., 2002). Therefore, the probability
of each target word given the preceding word in the child-directed speech of the Providence Corpus
(Demuth, et al., 2006) was calculated as the total number of productions of the bigram in the corpus
divided by the total number of uses of the preceding word. Because the probability of sequences
larger than bigrams does not affect word duration once bigram effects are controlled for (Bell,

trial.

3 Results
Children's production of the 16 target words was highly variable (mean: 11.3; range: 4-16). Adult
production was more consistent (mean: 13.8; range: 11-16). To permit comparisons within a homophone pair, a participant's production of a target word was included only if the participant produced at least one token of each meaning of the homophone pair. The numbers of productions of
each target word are presented by age group in Table 1.
The data were analyzed using linear mixed models (lme4; Bates, Maechler, Bolker & Walker,
2015) implemented in R (R Core Team, 2015). Frequency of the target word relative to its homophonic counterpart (higher vs. lower) and age group (child vs. adult) were included as fixed effects
with an interaction. Speaking rate of the experimenter and bigram probability were also included
as fixed effects. Participant and homophone pair were included as random effects. Statistical significance was tested by comparing models with and without the relevant effect or interaction using
maximum likelihood estimates. As all measures had a non-normal distribution, they were

presented in Table 2, the results of the analyses of the pitch measures are in Table 3 and the results
from the vowel formant measures are shown in Table 4.
Token duration in homophone production showed a significant effect of the relative frequency
of the target meaning, 2(2) = 12.37, p = 0.002, as well as a significant effect of the age of the participant, 2(2) = 52.33, p < 0.001. Lower frequency meanings had longer durations than higher
frequency meanings and children produced target words with longer durations than adult participants did. However, the interaction of age and frequency of meaning was not statistically significant for token duration, 2(1) = 0.381, p = 0.54, indicating that adults and children do not differ in
the extent of their exaggeration of token duration for lower frequency homophone meanings. An
additional fixed effect of speaking rate on token duration was also found, 2(1) = 10.22, p = 0.001,
but there was not an effect of predictability, 2(1) = 0.03, p = 0.86. This model also showed significant random effects of participant, 2(1) = 527.1, p < 0.001 and homophone pair, 2(1) = 452.9,
p < 0.001. Such effects likely reflect individual differences in typical pace of production and the
different numbers of phonemes in each homophone pair. The token duration results are shown in
Figure 2.
Vowel duration did not show a significant effect of meaning frequency 2(2) = 1.09, p = 0.58,
but did show a significant effect of age, 2(2) = 25.02, p < 0.001. The interaction of age and frequency on vowel duration was not significant, 2(1) = 0.006, p = 0.94. No effects of speaking rate,
2(1) = 1.3, p = 0.25 or predictability, 2(1) = 0.18, p = 0.67 on vowel duration were found. These
results indicate that, while children elongate vowels relative to adults, vowel duration is not
affected by meaning frequency, speaking rate, or predictability in any age group. Participant and
pair both showed significant effects on vowel duration, 2(1) = 473, p < 0.001; 2(1) = 29.01,
p < 0.001, respectively, likely indicating individual differences in production speed and effects of
different vowel types on vowel duration.
Mean pitch was not affected by the frequency of target meaning, 2(2) = 0.81, p = 0.67, but, as
expected, age did affect mean pitch, with children showing higher average mean pitch than adults,
2(2) = 28.78, p < 0.001. The interaction of frequency and age was not significant for mean pitch,
2(1) = 0.056, p = 0.813 and neither speaking rate, 2(1) = 2.53, p = 0.111 nor predictability, 2(1) =
0.141, p = 0.71 were significant predictors of mean pitch. Participant identity significantly affected

mean pitch, 2(1) = 214.1, p < 0.001, reflecting individual differences in fundamental frequency.
Somewhat unexpectedly, however, homophone pair also had a significant effect on mean pitch,
2(1) = 4.86, p = 0.027. Pitch range showed no effects of meaning frequency, 2(2) = 2.87, p = 0.24
or age, 2(2) = 0.16, p = 0.92 and no interaction of the frequency and age, 2(1) = 0.015, p = 0.9.
Speaking rate, 2(1) = 0.065, p = 0.8 and predictability, 2(1) = 0.279, p = 0.6 also did not affect pitch
range. Participant identity did significantly affect pitch range, 2(1) = 22.73, p < 0.001, again likely
due to individual variation in prosody. Pitch range was also significantly affected by homophone
pair, 2(1) = 42.29, p < 0.001. The effects of homophone pair on both pitch and pitch range suggest
natural variability in the prosody associated with specific phonological sequences. Critically for the
question at hand, no effects of meaning frequency were found for any pitch measure.
The first and second vowel formants were not significantly affected by relative frequency, age
or the interaction of the two (all p > 0.36). Predictability also did not significantly affect the first or
second vowel formants, 2(1) = 2.8, p = 0.09; 2(1) = 1.07, p = 0.3, respectively. Speaking rate
significantly affected the first formant, 2(1) = 10.01, p = 0.002, but not the second formant, 2(1)
= 0.342, p = 0.559. The vowel formants were both significantly affected by participant, F1: 2(1) =
126.75, p < 0.001; F2: 2(1) = 18.23, p < 0.001 and by homophone pair, F1: 2(1) = 381.61, p <
0.001; F2: 2(1) = 398.2, p < 0.001, indicating expected differences in vowel production between
participants and as the result of different vowel types.
In addition to static measure of vowel quality, two measures of formant change were analyzed.
The first, spectral change (), was significantly affected by participant age, 2(2) = 42.73, p < 0.001,
but not by meaning frequency, 2(2) = 1.92, p = 0.37, speaking rate, 2(1) = 0.17, p = 0.68, or predictability, 2(1) = 9, p = 0.34. The interaction of meaning frequency and age was also not significant for
spectral change, 2(1) = 0.047, p = 0.83. Spectral change was significantly affected by participant,
2(1) = 16.99, p < 0.001 and homophone pair, 2(1) = 159.4, p < 0.001. The other dynamic measure,
spectral angle (), was not significantly affected by meaning frequency, age, speaking rate, predictability, or participant (all p > 0.14). The interaction of frequency and age was also not significant for
spectral angle, 2(1) = 0.66, p = 0.42. Homophone pair did significantly affect spectral angle, 2(1)
= 4.49, p = 0.034, likely due to the different vowels in each homophone pair.
Overall, the results show consistent use of token duration to distinguish homophone meanings as a function of meaning frequency across both age groups, suggesting that children

from vocal tract size.

4 Discussion
The data presented in this article provide evidence for acoustic differentiation of homophone
meanings by both adults and children. Taken together, the results show that speakers of all ages
lengthen homophonous words when producing the lower frequency meaning. These findings are
consistent with an account of homophone acquisition in which children perceive the acoustic distinctions between homophone meanings in their input and incorporate those distinctions into their
lexical representations to guide their learning of homophonous words.
Acoustic differences between homophone meanings may support children's early acquisition of
homophones in natural contexts and account for their difficulties in learning pseudohomophones
in laboratory tasks, where tokens are pre-recorded and not differentiated in this way (e.g., Doherty,
2004; Mazzocco, 1997). In the real world, children have access to information, including acoustic
information, that allows them to disambiguate homophone meanings. When children encounter a
lower frequency homophone such as flour in their natural experience, they may notice that the
word is notably longer than it has been on previous encounters, when the intended meaning was
really its more frequent homophonic counterpart, flower. Children may also notice an absence of a
blossom from the context and assume that a different meaning is intended, although this cue may
be less reliable and harder to detect. Children do hear words in the absence of their referents with
some frequency and referential context is often ambiguous (Nichol Medina, Snedeker, Trueswell
& Gleitman, 2011), but the absence of the familiar referent may, along with other semantic cues,
support the assignment of a new meaning to a familiar phonological sequence under the right circumstances (Backsheider, et al., 1999; Dautriche, Chemla & Christophe, 2016). However, there is
some evidence that very young children struggle to use context and plausibility to determine the
intended meaning when a word that they already know is used in an unfamiliar way (Srinivasan &

Conwell

Figure 2. Data from the two durational measures (token duration and vowel duration) for each
homophone pair by relative frequency of the homophone meaning and age of the participant.

Barner, 2013). The availability of acoustic information may support that assignment by providing
children with bottom-up evidence that the two words are distinct.
The data from the present study are consistent with an account of homophone representation in
which acoustic distinctions are encoded as part of the lexical representation and directly associated
with different meanings (e.g., Gahl, 2008). Indeed, they further bolster the claim that acoustic differences in homophones are not merely byproducts of sentence-level prosodic processes, but rather
part of the word itself. Appeals to production processes, such as sentence prosody and articulatory
planning, as the cause of durational differences in homophone meanings (e.g., Lavoie, 2002) do
not explain why such differences are found in isolated tokens in an elicitation task. If these differences were entirely the result of phrasal or sentential prosody, isolated tokens would not show
them. One interpretation of these data is that these differences are encoded in the lexicon from
childhood on the basis of auditory experience. Whether this arises as a result of an exemplar-based
lexicon or whether some more abstract lexical representation might contain these differences as
part of the phonological specification is beyond the scope of these data. Another explanation of the
similarity of adult and child patterns of lengthening in homophones as a function of lemma frequency could be that articulatory planning processes that interact with lemma frequency are consistent across development and may not be a direct result of representational differences.
An alternative account of these findings is that the lower frequency targets were exaggerated
because they were being used contrastively in the study. That is, participants who had already produced the more frequent whole may have stressed their productions of hole later in the task to
indicate a contrast in meaning (Chafe, 1976; Cohn, et al., 2005), creating longer durations. In this
case, one would expect that participants would exaggerate second uses of words relative to first
uses, regardless of meaning frequency. Although stories were presented in random order, higher
frequency meanings could have been presented first more often than lower frequency meanings
were, resulting in exaggeration of lower frequency targets. However, examination of session
records shows that lower frequency homophone meanings were presented after their higher frequency counterparts only 47.9% of the time for adult participants and 46.2% of the time for child
participants, indicating that lower frequency meanings were not elongated to contrast them with
their higher frequency meaning.
One important feature of these data is that the only measure affected by meaning frequency was
token duration. Pitch and vowel measures (including vowel duration) were not affected by the

476

Language and Speech 61(3)

frequency of the target meaning. These results are consistent with the findings from spontaneous
child-directed speech (Conwell, 2017a). This shows that speakers are not just exaggerating all
aspects of their productions of less frequent items, but rather that the two meanings differ in their
phonetic realization along the single dimension of overall duration. The lack of an effect of meaning frequency on vowel articulation or on pitch shows that these effects are not the result of pitch
accent, increased lexical stress, or clearer articulation of lower frequency meanings. The lack of an
effect of frequency of meaning on vowel duration, in spite of the effect on token duration, is a bit
surprising: what is lengthened if not the vowel? Based on these data, the durations of all segments
in the less frequent meaning are likely slightly lengthened, leading to a cumulative difference that
is not carried by any single segment. The isolation of the effect of frequency to a single measure
further supports the claim that this effect is not the product of articulation or production processes
alone, but rather is part of the lexicon.
Token duration was additionally affected by the speaking rate of the experimenter, which is
potentially important because speaking rate may be affected by lexical frequency (Lavoie, 2002).
One explanation of this finding is that the experimenter may have unconsciously altered speaking
rate based on the homophone meaning that they knew to be the target. Although the analyses presented here statistically control for the effect of speaking rate on token duration, it is possible that
the participants' productions of the target words were influenced by the speaking rate of the experimenter. Some caution may be warranted in interpreting these results as reflecting truly isolated
tokens of the target words.
One potential limitation of this study is that the analyses were conducted over a small number of
homophone types. The small number of types is due to the short attention spans and performance
limitations of children in the age range. Many children failed to produce target words even though
their caregivers indicated that the words were highly familiar to the children. Nevertheless, the small
number of types raises questions regarding both the generalizability and the robustness of these
effects. It is possible that these specific homophone pairs show an effect of lemma frequency on
token duration, but that others would not. Prior literature does show a robust effect of lemma frequency on token duration in both adult-directed and child-directed speech (Conwell, 2017a; Gahl,
2008), however, suggesting that the pattern seen in the adult data in this study is likely to generalize
to other homophone pairs. The findings from child participants in this study indicate that children
do not differ from adults in terms of how lemma frequency affects their production of homophones.
While conservativism is wise when considering a finding based on a small number of word types,
this finding converges with other evidence on adult productions and provides the first real evidence
that children's productions of homophones might also be influenced by lemma frequency.
This article asked whether children's representations of homophones include the acoustic distinctions that differentiate homophone meanings in their experience by examining whether children exhibit those distinctions in their own productions of homophonous words. Children, like
adults, elongate the duration of lower frequency homophone tokens. These findings support an
account of homophone acquisition in which children incorporate acoustic differences from their
experience with homophone meanings into their representations of those words and could, therefore, use those differences as a bottom-up cue to the existence of two distinct lexical items with the
same phonological form.
