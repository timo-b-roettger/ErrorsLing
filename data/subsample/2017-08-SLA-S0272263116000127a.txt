THE EFFECTS OF THE TIMING OF
ISOLATED FFI ON THE EXPLICIT
KNOWLEDGE AND WRITTEN
ACCURACY OF LEARNERS WITH
DIFFERENT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF
THE LINGUISTIC TARGET

This study examines the effects of the timing of explicit instruction
(EI) on grammatical accuracy. A total of 123 learners were divided
into two groups: those with some productive knowledge of pastcounterfactual conditionals (+Prior Knowledge) and those without
such knowledge (-Prior Knowledge). Each group was divided into
four conditions. Two (Pre-EI and Pre+During-EI) studied an EI handout prior to a composition task, but only the Pre+During-EI learners
were allowed to refer to it during the task. The Post-EI learners received
the handout after completing the task to use to revise their texts.
The control group only completed the task. An error correction test
and a text reconstruction test were used as pre- and posttests. Results
showed that whereas the -Prior Knowledge learners benefited more
from receiving the EI prewriting than postwriting, the +Prior Knowledge learners benefited more from the opportunities to consult the
EI during or after the writing task.

Form-focused instruction (FFI) is defined as "any pedagogical effort
which is used to draw the learners' attention to language form either
implicitly or explicitly . . . within meaning-based approaches to L2 instruction and in which a focus on language is provided in either spontaneous
or predetermined ways" (Spada, 1997, p. 73). Form-focused instruction
in second language (L2) writing usually takes place in isolation from the
actual meaningful writing process (Polio, 2012) and is often labeled as
isolated FFI--that is, explicit instruction (EI) that acts as "preparation
for a communicative activity or after an activity in which students have
experienced difficulty with a particular language feature" (Spada &
Lightbown, 2008, p. 8). A common operationalization of FFI in writing
is written corrective feedback. Written corrective feedback is, by definition, postwriting FFI, as it can only take place after a writing task has
been completed. Other postwriting FFI includes postwriting language
reflections (e.g., Swain & Lapkin, 2008), postwriting oral feedback sessions
(Erlam, Ellis, & Batstone, 2013), and EI followed by learner self-revision
(e.g., Shintani & Ellis, 2013). Form-focused instruction can also be
operationalized as prewriting by providing EI on a preselected language
feature as preparation for a subsequent writing task. Researchers have
increasingly investigated the role of EI in isolation, not only to examine theoretical issues but also to assess the pedagogical question of
whether teaching grammar in isolation from communicative activities
is actually effective (Spada & Lightbown, 2008).
The effectiveness of postwriting FFI has been demonstrated by a
substantial number of studies on written corrective feedback (e.g.,
Bitchener & Knoch, 2010; Shintani & Ellis, 2013; Van Beuningen, De Jong, &
Kuiken, 2012). However, to date, little research has investigated the effects
of providing learners with isolated EI. One such study was conducted by
Shintani, Ellis, and Suzuki (2014), who investigated the effect of giving
or not giving university English as a foreign language (EFL) students the
opportunity to revise their writing after receiving postwriting EI for two
grammatical features (indefinite article and postcounterfactual condition). Accuracy of use was measured in new pieces of writing. The results
showed that providing explicit information led to increased accuracy for
the past-counterfactual conditional but not for the indefinite article;
providing the opportunity for revision enhanced the effects, which
were durable but reduced over time. This study indicates that postwriting EI for the past-counterfactual conditional structure can lead to accurate production of the feature in a new writing task for EFL learners.
Researchers have shown less interest in prewriting FFI. Some extant
studies have investigated the effects of isolated explicit grammar instruction when combined with corrective feedback (e.g., Bitchener & Knoch,
2010; Frantzen, 1995). These studies have generally shown positive
combined effects of EI and corrective feedback on grammatical accuracy
in subsequent writing tasks. G. Wang and S.-D. Wang (2014) provided

university students with explicit grammar instruction prior to having
them complete a composition task and questionnaire. They reported
that the instruction positively impacted the learners' writing and editing
abilities. However, no research, to my knowledge, has examined either
the effects of prewriting FFI alone or the comparative effects of pre- and
postwriting FFI on grammatical accuracy in L2 writing.
There are two ways to implement prewriting FFI: the metalinguistic
information given as FFI can be either available or unavailable for the
learners during the subsequent writing task. This continued availability
of information might influence the effects of isolated EI, particularly for
low-proficiency learners, who might have a limited capacity to utilize
information received during the prewriting phase in the actual writing
task (Kellogg, 1996).
There is a pedagogical need to investigate the timing of FFI and the
continued availability of explicit information for writing. Providing explicit
information on a problematic grammatical feature to an entire class is
more time efficient for teachers than providing written corrective feedback on each individual learner's written work. This approach might also
encourage learners to deductively self-edit their texts by utilizing explicit
information. Given that pre-activity grammar teaching is a familiar practice for L2 teachers, it would be intriguing to know when EI should be
provided (either before or after a writing task), and whether their students should be allowed to refer to such information during writing tasks.
THEORETICAL ISSUES REGARDING THE TIMING OF ISOLATED FFI
ON WRITING
Prewriting FFI
Explicit instruction involves providing learners with explanations about
a specific language feature with optional controlled practice using the
feature. There is plenty of evidence showing that EI leads to the development of explicit knowledge (e.g., Frantzen, 1995; Hu, 2011), which is
defined as "knowledge about language and about the uses to which
language can be put" (Ellis, 2004, p. 3). The role of explicit knowledge in
L2 writing has been widely acknowledged by L2 researchers (Bitchener,
2012; Polio, 2012; Williams, 2012). It has also been supported by researchers
advocating for the role of awareness at the level of "understanding" for
the subsequent processing of input and the development of L2 knowledge
(e.g., Leow, 2000; Robinson, 1995; Rosa & O'Neill, 1999; Schmidt, 2001).
Skill-acquisition theory (Anderson, 1983) claims that explicit learning can
lead to "knowledge that is functionally equivalent to implicit knowledge"
(DeKeyser, 2015, p. 106) through the proceduralization and automatization of explicitly learned knowledge. Information processing theory

132

Natsuko Shintani

(VanPatten, 1996, 2015; Williams, 1999) suggests that learners with less
explicit knowledge of a linguistic form might neglect it when processing
L2 input. For such learners, processing demands should be reduced by
providing explicit information in an isolated manner, followed by activities focusing entirely on processing L2 input.
The model of the writing process also provides some insight into how
learners' explicit knowledge facilitates L2 writing development (Flower &
Hayes, 1980; Hayes, 1996; Kellogg, 1996). Writing involves the simultaneous
use of multiple cognitive processes such as planning (setting goals and
generating and organizing ideas), formulating (translating and producing
texts), and revising (comparing a text already written with the writer's
mental representation of the text, at both the linguistic and conceptual
levels, and executing the revision) (Flower & Hayes, 1980; Galbraith,
Van Waes, & Torrance, 2007; Hayes, 1996; Kellogg, 1996). Learners
equipped with explicit knowledge before a writing task through prewriting FFI might be better able to formulate and revise their writing, as
they will have the opportunity to monitor their grammatical accuracy in
production and notice errors in already-written text, possibly leading
to error correction. This situation aligns with the theory of transferappropriate processing, which claims that language learning involves
acquiring not only the knowledge of specific linguistic items but also
the cognitive processes that the learner engaged in during learning.
Thus, the greater the similarity between the process of learning and
the process of future retrieval, the greater the expected success in performance (Blaxton, 1989; Franks, Bilbrey, Lien, & McNamara, 2000). Prewriting FFI might also promote transfer-appropriate processing in future
writing tasks because the learners would already have practice activating
their explicit knowledge while writing and revising.

Postwriting FFI
Postwriting FFI involves the learners first completing a writing task,
followed by some kind of EI to direct learners' attention to linguistic
form. According to the theoretical underpinnings of postwriting FFI,
learning takes place when the FFI provides the learners with input
that potentially elicits noticing and allows the learners to make cognitive comparisons between the input and original text (Doughty, 2001;
Swain, 1995), which might lead them to restructure their interlanguage system (Polio, 2012; Williams, 2012). The process of revision
also enables learners to produce the form accurately, which might
help proceduralize their explicit knowledge. There is substantial evidence that postwriting FFI in the form of written corrective feedback
is effective in guiding learners to revise their original texts and can lead

Timing of Isolated FFI for L2 Writing

133

to accurate production in new pieces of writing (Bitchener & Knoch,
2010; Shintani & Ellis, 2013; Van Beuningen et al., 2012; also see Bitchener & Ferris, 2012; Kang & Han, 2015).
In the current study, postwriting FFI took the form of a metalinguistic
explanation handout, which learners were asked to refer to while revising
their original texts. Providing explicit information only after the learners
have completed a writing task might lead them down the garden path
(inducing learners to make errors in production that are subsequently
corrected; Tomasello & Herron, 1988) and may lead to better internalization of information. It might also trigger the process of noticing the hole
(becoming aware of a knowledge gap; Doughty & Williams, 1998), which
can prompt the leaners to search for helpful information in future input
to resolve the deficiencies in their knowledge. However, it is also possible
that learners with limited explicit knowledge prior to the writing task
might produce errors, which may be repeated in the task. This potential
error cycle may proceduralize erroneous forms, which the learners will
then need to restructure when receiving postwriting FFI.

Continued Availability of EI
Providing prewriting FFI and then allowing the learner to access it while
writing assists learners in applying the explicit information when formulating texts in actual writing situations. Similar to prewriting FFI, continued
access to information is beneficial from the view of transfer-appropriate
processing (Blaxton, 1989; Franks, Bilbrey, Lien, & McNamara, 2000). Additionally, if online availability increases accurate production, it might also
increase the opportunity to proceduralize explicit knowledge (DeKeyser,
1998). It may also be particularly beneficial for learners with limited ability
to actually use the linguistic form. For such learners, prewriting instruction
alone might not be sufficient to utilize the information in subsequent writings. Because learners need to simultaneously attend to multiple aspects
of language while writing, their working memory may experience overload,
rendering them unable to effectively use explicit knowledge in the writing
task (Kellogg, 1996). It is also possible that the learners may not use their
explicit knowledge simply because they prioritize other aspects of writing,
such as content and vocabulary use. Allowing learners to access the explicit
information during the writing task may potentially make the learners more
attentive to linguistic form, which might enhance error detection. The
language aptitude-treatment interaction (Robinson, 2001; Snow, 1991) suggests that L2 learning might be influenced by the interaction between a
learner's patterns of abilities in relevant areas for L2 processing.
However, little research has been conducted on the effects of prewriting
FFI with the continued availability of explicit information, save for a few

134

studies reporting the positive effects of using online dictionaries during
composition tasks (e.g., Bruton, 2007; Christianson, 1997).
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
The preceding discussion suggests the necessity of investigating the
interaction between learners' prior knowledge and two dimensions of
isolated FFI for writing: the timing of FFI and the continued availability
of explicit information. To investigate these issues, the current study
adopted three conditions of isolated EI: (a) prewriting EI with the continued availability of explicit information while writing, (b) prewriting EI
without the continued availability of explicit information, and (c) postwriting EI with the opportunity to revise after receiving explicit information. To examine whether learners' prior knowledge had any impact on
the effects of the instruction, the study targeted two groups of learners:
learners with some prior productive knowledge of the grammatical form
and those without any prior knowledge. The following research questions
were posed:
1.To what extent does the timing of isolated EI (i.e., prewriting vs. postwriting)
affect the development of (a) explicit knowledge and (b) accuracy in subsequent writing by learners with or without prior grammatical knowledge of
the form?
2.To what extent does the continued availability of explicit information after
prewriting EI affect the development of (a) explicit knowledge and (b) accuracy
in subsequent writing by learners with or without prior grammatical knowledge of the form?
3.Do the effects of isolated EI under different conditions vary for learners with
or without prior grammatical knowledge of the form?

METHODS
Participants
A total of 123 Japanese learners of English in seven intact intensive English
university classes participated in the study. They were second-year students majoring in sociology, economics, English literature, and Japanese
literature. They had all obtained a score ranging between 460 and 725 on
the paper-based TOEIC before participating in the project.1 As described
in a later section, the participants were assigned to one of two groups,
-Prior Knowledge (n = 64) and +Prior Knowledge (n = 59), based on
their ability to produce the linguistic target correctly in the pretreatment
writing task. They were further randomly divided into four groups:
Pre+During-EI, Pre-EI, Post-EI, and the control group.

Design
Figure 1 summarizes the research design. During Week 1, all participants took the error correction (EC) test and performed the first text
reconstruction (TR) test as a pretest. The scores from the first TR test
were also used to divide the participants into the +Prior Knowledge and
-Prior Knowledge groups. During Week 2, the participants attended two
sessions. In the first session, the four groups completed the writing
task in accordance with the different treatments. In the second session
(2-3 days later), all participants completed TR Test 2, which served as
the posttest. In Week 4, all participants completed TR Test 3 as a delayed
posttest and the same EC test taken during the pretest.

Target Structure
The target structure in this study was the past-counterfactual conditional, which expresses the hypothetical outcome of an event that
did not occur in the past, and usually consists of an if-clause and a

136

main clause. Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman (1999) argued that
acquiring English conditionals is difficult for L2 learners because the
structure is complex both syntactically and semantically. They pointed
out that the acquisition of this structure requires knowledge of the
tense-aspect system, modal auxiliaries, and negation. Izumi, Bigelow,
Fujiwara, and Fearnow (1999) argued that the difficulty of this structure
lies in the fact that it requires learners to encode two functions: hypotheticality and past time reference. Previous studies have shown that
university students in Japan, regardless of their major, do not usually
have solid control over this structure in writing, despite possessing
some explicit knowledge of its construction (Izumi et al., 1999; Shintani,
2015; Shintani et al., 2014).

Treatment Materials and Procedure
Pretask. Two days before the treatment session, the participants
received a pretask to complete at home. This task required the learners
to write five English sentences describing five events that had changed
their life (e.g., "I went to Australia for homestay when I was in high
school"). This served as preparation for students to complete the main
task; because participants' writing ability was limited overall, using
such a pretask enabled them to prepare the content and vocabulary
necessary to complete the compositions in the main tasks and treatment
sessions. Care was taken that all the participants completed the pretask
before the main task. None of the participants used the past-counterfactual
conditional structure in their pretask sentences.
Main Task. All participants completed the same writing task in the
main task phase. They received a writing sheet with sufficient space to
write their composition. The instructions on the sheet asked the participants to write a composition on what would have happened if the five
events they came up with in the pretask had not occurred. All groups
were allowed to refer to their pretask while writing. They were given
20 min to complete the composition.
EI Sheet. All participants in the experimental groups received the
same EI handout, which contained metalinguistic explanations of the
target grammatical structure in Japanese, its meaning, and some example
sentences in English (see Appendix A).
In the main task, the three experimental groups were given the EI
sheet at different points in time. The Pre+During-EI group and the Pre-EI
group received the EI sheet before starting the writing task and were
given 5 min to study it. The Pre+During-EI group was allowed to keep

Timing of Isolated FFI for L2 Writing

137

the sheet for reference while writing, but the Pre-EI group was not.
The Post-EI group received the EI sheet only after they had completed
the writing task.2 These participants were given 5 min to revise their
writing based on the EI sheet. The control group did not receive the
EI sheet at all.

Testing Materials and Procedure
TR Test. Three TR tasks adapted from Shintani et al. (2014) were used
to measure the learners' accurate use of the target structure (i.e., the
past-counterfactual conditional) in writing. The prepared materials
included (a) an audio-recorded story (185, 199, or 215 words in length),
(b) a note-taking sheet, and (c) a TR sheet (see Appendix B for an example).
Each story included six past-counterfactual conditional sentences.
The participants were given the note-taking sheet and were asked to make
notes while listening to an audio-recorded text twice. They were then given
the TR sheet and were asked to reconstruct the text within 20 min. The
three TR tests were counterbalanced to avoid test bias; the four groups
were further divided into three subgroups, each of which completed the
three tasks in a different order as pre-, post-, and delayed posttests.
Text reconstructions were chosen because of the necessity to create
a context for use of the past-counterfactual conditional. In a free-writing
task of the kind used in a number of written corrective feedback studies,
learners are likely to avoid the use of such a complex structure. Passage
reconstruction, on the other hand, creates contexts for multiple uses
of the past-counterfactual conditional, as attested in previous studies
(Shintani, 2015; Shintani et al., 2014).
EC Test. The EC test was designed to measure the learners' explicit
knowledge of the past-counterfactual conditional. It consisted of 16
decontextualized sentences, each containing a single error. Eight sentences included errors in the use of the past-counterfactual conditional:
four on the use of the auxiliary have and the past participle in the
if-clauses, and four on the use of the modal verb, the auxiliary have,
and the past participle in the main clauses (see Appendix C). The other
eight included other grammatical errors (e.g., definite article, verb tense,
and third-person -s) as distractors.3 The test asked the learners to first
identify the errors in the sentences and then write the correct forms. The
same test was conducted as a pretest before the participants started
their first piece of writing and as a delayed posttest after the final piece of
writing at the end of the study. This was done to avoid exposing the participants to the information in the EC test, which included both correct
and incorrect target forms, at any point between the three TR tests.

Data Analysis
Coding and Scoring. To examine the participants' behaviors in the
writing and TR tests, all writing sheets were first analyzed in terms of
the number of past-counterfactual conditional sentences attempted by
each learner. When a learner attempted a sentence including an if-clause
corresponding to one of the past-counterfactual conditional sentences in
the passage, one "attempt" point was awarded regardless of whether or
not the sentence was correct. Next, the scoring system used by Shintani
et al. (2014) (summarized in Table 1) was used to code for accuracy in
both the writing treatment and the three TR tests. Appendix D provides
some example sentences that the participants produced, as well as
scores. For the Post-EI group, accuracy scores during the treatment session were coded at two time points: before and after self-editing. Accuracy was determined by using the revision history function in Google
Docs. The total score for each student was calculated as follows:

Number of points scored
Number of conditional sentences
Grouping Participants. The +Prior Knowledge and -Prior Knowledge
status of the learners was determined based on the pretest scores on
the TR test using the following criteria: Learners who demonstrated
some ability to accurately produce the past-counterfactual conditional
structure were coded as "+Prior Knowledge," whereas those who did
not were coded as "-Prior Knowledge." More specifically, a participant
was classified as +Prior Knowledge if he or she scored points on Criteria
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 in Table 1 and as -Prior Knowledge if he or she scored
0 or scored points only according to Criterion 4. This decision was

made because Criterion 4 is not a unique feature of the past-counterfactual
conditional; the hypothetical conditional (the so-called second conditional) also requires the past modal. Izumi et al. (1999) reported that
Japanese university students had difficulty in accurately marking the
perfect aspect (related to Criteria 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) but rarely failed to
provide a past modal in a main clause (Criterion 4). In the current study,
-Prior Knowledge learners included 64 participants: 26 who scored 0 and
38 who scored points only on Criterion 4. The +Prior Knowledge learners
included the other 59 participants, who scored points on at least one
criterion other than Criterion 4 in Table 1.
Data Analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS.
Cronbach's alphas were used to estimate the reliability of the two tests.
The alpha for the 16 items on the EC test (pretest) was .95, and those for
the 7 categorical items used to score the three TR tasks (pretest) were
.92, .85, and .88, respectively; this verified the internal consistency of
the tasks. Interrater reliability for the accuracy scores on the two tests
was established by having two raters analyze 15% of the data. Cohen's
Kappa was calculated as ranging from k = .71 to k = .98, showing that,
overall, the raters achieved a high level of agreement (see Appendix E
for the detailed statistical results).
As all the datasets satisfied the assumptions for normality, homogeneity
of variances, and independence, the comparative analysis employed a
mixed-models ANOVA followed by planned multiple comparisons using
Bonferroni adjustments. Partial eta-squared (p2) and Cohen's d were
used to estimate effect sizes.

RESULTS
This section first reports the number times learners attempted to produce the target structure both in the treatment and testing regime, to
confirm that the materials were effective in eliciting the target form.
Then it presents the results for the EC and TR tests. To allow for an
examination of the mediating influence of learners' prior knowledge, the
results for the -Prior Knowledge and +Prior Knowledge learners are
reported separately. Finally the section reports the accuracy scores for
the treatment regime for the purpose of explaining the test results.

Prior knowledge

+Prior Knowledge learners across all four groups showed mean attempts
close to five (ranging from 3.94 to 4.87), indicating that the task successfully elicited the target feature. There was no statistically significant
interaction effect between prior knowledge and treatment types (see
Appendix F for the results of inferential statistics).
Table 3 shows the number of attempts at past-counterfactual conditional sentences in the three TR tests (pre-, post-, and delayed posttest). The overall high frequency of attempts (ranging from 4.12 to 5.80)
on the pretest indicates that the writing test used in this study successfully elicited the target feature. There were no statistically significant
interaction effects among any of the three factors (i.e., levels of prior
knowledge, different types of treatment, and three repeated tests) (see
Appendix F for the results of inferential statistics).

Results for the EC Tests
Table 4 shows the descriptive statistics for the EC tests (pretest and
delayed posttest). Results of the mixed-models ANOVA showed significant effects for time, F(1, 115) = 82.34, p < .01, p2 = .42, and for Time x
Treatment interaction, F(3, 115) = 3.910, p = .01, p2 = .09. The effects for
prior knowledge approached statistical significance, F(1, 115) = 3.41,
p = .07, p2 = .03. However, there were no significant effects for treatment,
F(3, 115) = 1.22, p = .31, p2 = .03, for Time x Prior Knowledge interaction,
F(2, 230) = 2.65, p = .11, p2 = .02, for Treatment x Prior Knowledge interaction, F(3, 115) = .31, p = .82, p2 = .01, or for Time x Treatment x Prior
Knowledge interaction, F(6, 230) = 1.47, p = .23, p2 = .04. The largest effect
was found for time, followed by Time x Treatment interaction. The
other effect sizes appeared to be relatively small.
Planned pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment showed
some statistically significant within- and between-group differences.
For the -Prior Knowledge learners, the three experimental groups
significantly improved from pretest to posttest (Pre+During-EI: p < .01,
95% CI [2.36, 4.47], d = 1.74; Pre-EI: p < .01, [1.48, 3.58], d = 1.08; and
Post-EI: p = .01, [.35, 2.56], d = .55); the control group also showed
improvement close to significance (p = .06, [-.05, 2.19], d = .35). There
were notable within-group effect size differences among the three
experimental groups: d = .67 between the Pre+During-EI and Pre-EI
groups, and d = .57 between the Pre-EI and Post-EI groups. Group differences were only observed on the delayed posttest. The Pre+DuringEI group outperformed the control group with a larger effect size
(p = .04, [.82, 3.75], d = .87), whereas the other two experimental
groups did not.

As for the +Prior Knowledge learners, the three experimental groups
improved significantly from pretest to posttest (Pre+During-EI: p = .02,
[.27, .259], d = 1.06; Pre-EI: p < .01, [1.15, 3.39], d = 1.25; and Post-EI: p = .01,
[.61, 2.85], d = .86). All three experimental groups showed large effect
sizes with slight differences; the Pre-EI group showed the largest, followed
by the Pre+During-EI and then the Post-EI group. The control group did
not show any statistically significant gains (95% CI crossing zero) with a
small effect size (p = .41, [-65, 1.59], d = .26). There were no statistically
significant differences among any of the groups on either pretest or
delayed posttest with marginal effect sizes. All had 95% CI crossing zero.
Results for the TR Tasks
Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics for the three TR tests (pre-,
post-, and delayed posttest). The effects were tested by a mixed-model
ANOVA. The test revealed significant effects for time, F(2, 230) = 71.60,
p < .01, p2 = .39, treatment, F(3, 115) = 6.94, p < .01, p2 = .15, prior knowledge, F(1, 115) = 135.41, p < .01, p2 = .54, Time x Treatment interaction,
F(6, 230) = 5.27, p < .01, p2 = .12, Time x Prior Knowledge interaction,
F(2, 230) = 9.40, p < .01, p2 = .08, and Time x Treatment x Prior Knowledge
interaction, F(6, 230) = 4.13, p = .01, p2 = .10, and a close to significant
effect for Treatment x Prior Knowledge interaction, F(3, 115) = 2.47,
p = .065, p2 = .06. The strongest effect was found for prior knowledge,
followed by time and treatment. Interaction effects were shown to be
relatively small. The results of the planned pairwise comparisons with
Bonferroni adjustment are reported in the following sections in terms
of (a) differences between -Prior Knowledge and +Prior Knowledge

comparisons, and (c) +Prior Knowledge learners' within- and betweengroup comparisons.
Differences between -Prior Knowledge and +Prior Knowledge Learners.

Table 6 presents the test results for the comparisons between -Prior
Knowledge and +Prior Knowledge learners. Clear differences appeared
between the two groups of learners for all four experimental conditions
on the pretest, with effect sizes ranging from 2.66 to 3.74. However, the
differences between the - and +Prior Knowledge learners diminished on
the two posttests for all four groups, although three of them (i.e., the
Pre+During-EI, the Post-EI, and the control) maintained their significant
differences. The difference in the Pre-EI condition became statistically
nonsignificant on both the posttest (d = .17) and delayed posttest (.50).
This suggests that in this condition the difference between the two
groups became smaller after the treatment session, although the effect
sizes indicate that the +Prior Knowledge learners were still superior to
the -Prior Knowledge learners.
-Prior Knowledge Learners. Table 7 shows the statistical results for
the within-group differences for the -Prior Knowledge learners. The effect size differences between the pretest and posttest showed that the
Pre-EI group had the strongest effects, followed by the Pre+During-EI,
Post-EI, and control groups. On the delayed posttest, however, the
Pre+During-EI group showed a larger effect size than the Pre-EI group.
The three experimental groups significantly improved from pretest to
posttest, whereas the control group did not (95% CI crossing zero). The
Pre+During-EI group's performance did not significantly decrease from
posttest to delayed posttest, with 95% CI crossing zero. This group
maintained significant gains on the delayed posttest as compared to the
pretest. The Pre-EI group's performance, on the other hand, significantly
decreased from posttest to delayed posttest, although performance on

the delayed posttest was still significantly higher than that on the pretest.
The Post-EI group did not lose its significant gains from posttest to delayed
posttest, with 95% CI crossing zero. However, this group failed to show
significant gains on the delayed posttest as compared to the pretest,
although the effect size (.61) indicated a moderate effect associated with
this treatment.
Table 8 shows the results for the between-group comparisons. No statistically significant differences were observed among any of the groups
on the pretest (95% CI crossing zero), with effect sizes being marginal to
small. On the posttest, the three experimental groups showed different
levels of effects. The Pre-EI group showed the largest effect sizes against
the control group, followed by the Pre+During-EI group. These two
groups' advantages over the control group were also statistically significant, and these results were maintained on the delayed posttest. These
groups significantly outperformed the Post-EI group on the posttest.
Although only the Pre+During-EI group maintained the advantage on
the delayed posttest, the effect size for the Pre-EI group (.68) indicated
some advantages of this condition when compared to the Post-EI condition. No statistically significant differences appeared over the three
tests for the Post-EI group or the control group, with CI crossing zero on
the two posttests.
+Prior Knowledge Learners. Table 9 shows the results for the withingroup comparisons (pre-, post-, and delayed posttest) for the +Prior
Knowledge learners. The Pre+During-EI and the Post-EI groups significantly improved from pretest to posttest and from pretest to delayed
posttest. Both groups showed similarly large effect sizes. The Pre-EI
and control groups did not show any statistically significant changes
from the pretest to posttest or delayed posttest, with CI crossing zero.
Although the Pre-EI group showed a moderate effect size on the posttest, it fell to marginal on the delayed posttest.

As Table 10 shows, no statistically significant group differences
appeared for the +Prior Knowledge learners. On all comparisons,
95% CI crossed zero. However, some group comparisons showed
notably larger effect sizes than others. The Pre+During-EI group showed
a large effect size as compared with the control group, followed by
the Post-EI group, which showed a moderate effect size. The Pre-EI
group showed small effects against the control group throughout the
test regime. The Pre+During-EI group also showed a large effect size
as compared with the Pre-EI group.

Accurate Production in the Treatment Regime
To understand the test results, learners' accurate production during
the treatment regime was also analyzed. Table 11 shows the accuracy scores for the attempted target structure sentences during the
treatment. The initial accuracy scores for the Post-EI and the control
groups indicate that the +Prior Knowledge group (2.94 and 3.32, respectively) had already acquired some knowledge such that they were able
to produce the target form with no assistance during the treatment,
whereas the -Prior Knowledge group learners (.95 and .79, respectively)
had very limited ability to do so. The right column ("Accuracy after selfediting") shows that the members of the Post-EI group, after revising
their original text based on information from the EI sheet, improved
their accuracy to an equal or greater extent than the other groups.
Differences among the four groups with the two levels of prior
knowledge, -Prior Knowledge and +Prior Knowledge, were examined
using a two-way ANOVA. Initial accuracy scores were used for analysis
of the Post-EI group. The results showed no significant effects for
prior knowledge, F(1, 115) = 3.55, p = .156, p2 = .54, and a close to
significant effect for treatment, F(3, 115) = 6.66, p = .077, p2 = .87--
both with large effect sizes--as well as a significant effect for Prior
Knowledge x Treatment interaction, F(3, 115) = 8.32, p < .01, p2 = .18,
with a small effect size. Bonferroni pairwise comparisons between
the -Prior Knowledge and +Prior Knowledge learners revealed no
statistically significant differences for the Pre+During-EI (p = .35,
[-.41, 1.16], d = .19) or Pre-EI groups (p = .69, [-.62, .93], d = .17), with
small effect sizes. However, the +Prior Knowledge learners outperformed the -Prior Knowledge learners in the Post-EI (p < .01, [1.20,
2.79], d = 2.00) and control groups (p < .01, [1.12, 2.91], d = 2.12), with
large effect sizes.
Additionally, as summarized in Table 12, there were no significant differences between the Pre+During-EI and the Pre-EI groups for the -Prior
Knowledge learners or the +Prior Knowledge learners. The effect sizes

The preceding tests showed that for both the - and +Prior Knowledge
learners, the accuracy scores were higher for the Pre+During-EI and
Pre-EI groups than for the Post-EI and control groups, suggesting that
the learners in the former groups were able to produce sentences more
accurately during the treatment by receiving pretask EI.
DISCUSSION
The study investigated the effect of providing different timings of isolated EI for writing (Research Question 1) with or without its continued
availability (Research Question 2) on the L2 development of the pastcounterfactual conditional. It also examined whether the effects of these
different conditions varied for learners with more or less prior ability to
produce the target structure (Research Question 3). The effects were
examined in terms of learners' explicit knowledge of the target structure,
as measured by an EC test, and accurate production of the target form
in a new writing task, as measured by TR tests.
Overall, positive improvement by the experimental groups compared
to the control group suggests that isolated EI was effective in improving
learners' accurate production in subsequent writing tasks, as has been
attested in previous research (Bitchener & Ferris, 2012). More specifically, the results revealed the facilitative role of isolated metalinguistic
information in shaping performance on a new writing task (Bitchener &
Knoch, 2010; Shintani & Ellis, 2013; Shintani et al., 2014). However, the
results revealed notable differences across different conditions of EI,
and for learners with different abilities to produce the target structure
before the treatment.

Timing of EI and Explicit Knowledge
The effect of the different timings of EI (Research Question 1) was examined by comparing the performance of the Pre-EI group (prewriting EI)
and the Post-EI group (postwriting EI with revision). The comparative
results for the EC tests are summarized in Table 13.
The overall results suggest that both pre- and postwriting EI helped
learners both with and without prior productive knowledge of the target structure improve their explicit knowledge (i.e., the ability to identify and correct errors in the target structure). This supports previous
research showing that isolated EI can lead to improvements in learners'
explicit knowledge (Shintani & Ellis, 2013).
However, the Pre-EI group demonstrated overall larger within-group
effects than the Post-EI group, with substantial effect size differences

(.56 for the -Prior Knowledge learners and .39 for the +Prior Knowledge
learners), indicating that isolated EI may be more effective when it is
provided before the writing task than after. One possible explanation
for this result is the cognitive requirements of the two conditions. Although
the Pre- and Post-EI groups both had 5 min to study the information on
the EI sheet, the Post-EI learners also needed to revise their text. Thus
the learners in the Post-EI group might not have had sufficient time to
fully understand the explanation on the EI sheet. The effect size differences of the two groups were similar for the - and +Prior Knowledge
learners, indicating that the advantage of providing EI before writing
was consistent for learners both with and without prior knowledge of
the target structure. However, it is also possible that Pre-EI was more
beneficial for -Prior Knowledge learners because they received the EI
before writing and thus had more time to process the information than
the Post-EI group.

Timing of EI and Accuracy in a New Writing Task
As summarized in Table 14, the results for the TR tests showed different
patterns for -Prior Knowledge and +Prior Knowledge learners.
The results for the -Prior Knowledge learners suggested that the
Pre-EI group had overall greater effects compared to the Post-EI group.
Whereas the Pre-EI group showed large, durable effect sizes for both
within- and between-group comparisons, all of which reached statistical
significance, the Post-EI group only showed a significant within-group
effect on the posttest; the effect disappeared on the delayed posttest.

Additionally, this group did not demonstrate a statistically significant
advantage over the control group on either the posttest or delayed posttest. The within-group effect sizes for the two groups notably differed (the
differences were 1.86 for the posttest and .80 for the delayed posttest),
suggesting that for learners with little or no productive knowledge of the
target structure, isolated EI was more helpful when provided before the
writing task than after. The result accords with the notion that possessing
some explicit knowledge can help learners in the process of formulating
and revising their writing (Flower & Hayes, 1980). As highlighted by skilllearning theory (DeKeyser, 2015), developing explicit knowledge before a
writing task might help learners produce more accurate sentences, which
may in turn assist in the automatization of procedural knowledge.
The TR test results for the +Prior Knowledge learners stood in stark contrast to those for the -Prior Knowledge learners. Under the Pre-EI condition, the development of explicit knowledge (measured by the EC test) did
not substantively carry over to accurate production of the target feature
in the new writing task. Under the Post-EI condition, on the other hand,
learners showed statistically significant improvement from the pretest to
the posttest, and from the pretest to the delayed posttest, although the
between-group differences (compared to the control group) did not reach
statistical significance. Effect sizes for the two groups substantially and
continuously differed on both within-group comparisons (group effect size
differences of 1.16 for the posttest and 1.18 for the delayed posttest) and
between-group comparisons (.31 for the posttest and .38 for the delayed
posttest). The results indicate that the +Prior Knowledge learners, who
had already started to be able to produce a partially accurate form,
seemed to benefit from the opportunity to engage in postwriting EI rather

152

Natsuko Shintani

than prewriting EI, and such benefit can be retained over time. This supports the notion that once learners become able to use a linguistic form,
noticing the gap between their output and the correct form, followed by
retroactive modification, can better facilitate L2 learning than merely
developing explicit knowledge (Swain & Lapkin, 2008).
For both - and +Prior Knowledge learners, the Post-EI group's significant gain on the posttest decreased on the delayed posttest. These
results are similar to those of previous studies. According to Shintani
et al. (2014), learners who received a metalinguistic explanation after a
writing task and revised their original text demonstrated marked improvement in the accuracy in writing from the pretest to the posttest (d = .76)
but a significant decrease in the delayed posttest completed 2 weeks
later (d = .43). The current study showed larger effects on the posttest
than those of Shintani et al.'s study. This might be due to the timing of the
posttest; in the present study the posttest was conducted 2 to 3 days
after the treatment session, whereas Shintani et al. conducted theirs
7 days after the treatment.

Continued Availability of EI and Explicit Knowledge
The effects of the continued availability of the EI (Research Question 2)
were examined by comparing the test scores for the Pre+During-EI and
the Pre-EI groups. The results of the EC tests are summarized in Table 15.
As shown in Table 15, the -Prior Knowledge learners in the Pre+DuringEI and Pre-EI conditions showed similar between-group effect sizes
(.87 and .76), which were notably larger than the effect sizes shown by
the +Prior Knowledge learners across the same conditions (.22 and .23).
Both groups demonstrated significant within-group improvement, whereas
the control group did not. This indicates that the prewriting EI, irrespective of its online availability, had more impact on the explicit knowledge
of the -Prior Knowledge learners than the +Prior Knowledge learners.4

Continued Availability of EI and Accuracy in a New Writing Task
As summarized in Table 16, the TR tests produced results that greatly
varied from the EC tests.
For the -Prior Knowledge learners, both the Pre+During-EI and PreEI conditions were found to be beneficial compared to the control. The
Pre-EI condition initially showed greater within- and between-group
effects than the Pre+During-EI condition, which showed substantially
smaller effect sizes on the delayed posttest. The between-group effect

sizes were similar on the delayed posttest, indicating that the long-term
effects of the two conditions are compatible. The results correspond
with those of the EC tests (i.e., both groups similarly acquired explicit
knowledge; see Table 10), indicating that prewriting EI, irrespective of
online accessibility, helped learners with limited prior knowledge of the
grammatical feature develop their explicit knowledge and accurately
produce the form in writing.
The +Prior Knowledge learners showed very different results.
Significant within- and between-group gains were found only for the
Pre+During-EI group. The Pre-EI group did not show any significant

gains over time or any advantages over the control group. Both
within- and between-group effect sizes for the two groups also differed
substantially, indicating that the online availability of the EI had a
large effect on accuracy in subsequent writing tasks for learners with
some prior knowledge of the structure. The clear difference between
the Pre+During-EI and Pre-EI groups is striking given that both had
5 min to study the EI sheet before the writing task; the difference
thus lay in the accessibility of the EI during the writing task. This
supports the preceding assertion that the improvement in explicit
knowledge did not serve as a determining factor for accurate production in writing for these learners. As noted previously, the Pre+DuringEI group produced more accurate sentences than the Pre-EI group
during the treatment session (with a group effect size difference of .55;
see Table 11). Apparently, access to the EI while writing enabled the
learners to monitor their accurate use of past-counterfactual conditional sentences and to correct their errors within the task. The subsequent revision based on the EI enabled learners to produce the
correct form, increasing the opportunity for production practice using
accurate forms; this is thought to be necessary for automatizing procedural knowledge (DeKeyser, 1998).
Having an opportunity to apply the EI when monitoring online
(Pre+During-EI) or revising writing (Post-EI) seemed particularly important for the +Prior Knowledge learners. Notably, the +Prior Knowledge
learners in the Pre+During-EI condition (d = 1.27) demonstrated greater
gains against the control group than those in the Post-EI condition (d = .70)
on the posttest, dropping to similar levels on the delayed posttest
(Pre+During-EI: d = .65; Post-EI: d = 56). The Post-EI group did not show as
drastic decreases in their effects over time compared to the Pre+DuringEI group. Both groups showed greater effect sizes than the Pre-EI group
on the posttest. It might thus be possible to argue that it was the opportunity to monitor or revise the text using the EI that promoted the +Prior
Knowledge learners' accurate production ability. In other words, both
"online revision" (the Pre+During-EI condition) and "isolated revision"
(the Post-EI condition) developed the +Prior Knowledge learners' ability
to use the target structure in writing, compared to providing isolated EI
alone. Revision enabled learners to self-correct their production, a cognitive process that is thought to facilitate L2 learning (Doughty, 2001).

The Differences between the -Prior Knowledge and +Prior
Knowledge Learners
The results indicate that the isolated EI used in this study was more effective at enhancing the accurate production of learners with less prior

productive knowledge of the form. It thus seems that gaining explicit
knowledge is particularly helpful for those with limited ability in producing the form in actual writing. This finding is in support of skill-learning
theory, which claims that declarative knowledge (i.e., explicit knowledge) helps learners develop procedural knowledge (DeKeyser, 2015).
The preceding analyses on the timing and online accessibility of
EI identified different patterns for each group that more accurately explain
the results. Notably, the -Prior Knowledge learners benefited more from
the opportunity to thoroughly acquire explicit knowledge, whereas,
comparatively, the +Prior Knowledge learners benefited from the opportunity to revise their texts, either during (i.e., the Pre+During-EI group)
or after (i.e., the Post-EI group) the writing tasks, by consulting the EI
sheet. This may have been due to the opportunity to make comparisons
between the EI and their in-progress or already written texts, which in
turn helped the learners produce the form accurately in a new writing
task. The learners in the Pre+During-EI group had the opportunity to
immediately solve their linguistic problems by consulting the EI, as
evidenced by their highly accurate production (see Table 11). This
was particularly reflected in the posttest scores, in which learners
developed the ability to produce the correct form to the greatest
extent. To fully benefit from the trial-and-error process in the Post-EI
condition, the learners seemingly needed to have previously acquired
some knowledge of the form, which possibly explains why the opportunities for revision did not matter as much for the -Prior Knowledge
learners.
CONCLUSION
The findings of the current study suggest that isolated EI involves different cognitive processes in L2 writing depending on when, how, and to
whom it is provided. The results suggest that providing EI prewriting
can aid in the development of explicit knowledge, especially for learners
with less ability to produce the linguistic form. On the other hand, providing EI postwriting furnishes the opportunity for revision, which is
helpful for those who have already acquired some knowledge of the
target form. The availability of explicit information online had the greatest influence on the writing accuracy of learners with some prior knowledge of the form. The findings suggest that learners who have started to
produce a grammatical structure may benefit from opportunities to
notice the form during and after writing, allowing them to confirm/
revise their original production rather than trying to improve their initial understanding of the grammatical rules. The study showed that the
cognitive processes involved in L2 writing are influenced by both
learner-external (e.g., the design of the instruction) and learner-internal

156

Natsuko Shintani

(e.g., learners' language knowledge) factors (Flower & Hayes, 1980;
Kellogg, 1996). It also suggests that improvement in accuracy in L2
writing is not linear, which is consistent with the idea that improving in
the early stages by acquiring explicit knowledge of problematic grammatical structures is easy, but development slows over time because
sustained improvement requires repeated production practice for
automatization to occur (DeKeyser, 1998).
The study had some limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small for a 2 x 4 factorial, three-repeated-measures design.
Thus, the findings should be interpreted with some caution. Second,
the study only included one type of test for each of the investigated
variables (i.e., explicit knowledge and accuracy in writing). The EC
test required the ability to identify and correct errors in discrete
sentences. Text reconstructions were used to elicit the target sentences, but they also required the ability to comprehend oral input
and take notes based on it. The findings would be more valid if multiple measurements, including metalinguistic explanation and freewriting tasks, were employed. Third, it might have been more pedagogically
fair for the Post-EI groups if the writing tasks were repeated multiple
times, or if more time was given for studying the EI and using it to
revise their text. Finally, it might have been ecologically more valid
if the Pre-EI groups had completed the writing task a few days after
receiving the EI. These issues call for further research and a refined
design.
Future research should expand on the current study in a number
of ways. One possible study could involve task repetition. Studies have
shown that repetitive writing tasks result in different performance
(Baba & Nitta, 2014). It would be interesting to see whether isolated EI
influences learners differently using repeated tasks. Another important
aspect is the effect of FFI on other types of language features. The pastcounterfactual conditional is a complex and salient feature (Izumi et al.,
1999). Roehr (2008, 2010) suggested that difficulty with learning grammatical rules explicitly varies based on the schematicity, conceptual
complexity, technicality, truth value, stability, and context independency
of grammatical structures. Explicit instruction on features with different
difficulties might thus result in different outcomes. Finally, individual
learner differences require further research with regard to noticing in
writing (Sachs & Polio, 2007), working memory capacity (Kellogg, 1996),
and language analytical ability (Shintani & Ellis, 2013), given that these
factors may mediate the effects of a metalinguistic explanation on writing
development.

NOTES
1. The mean scores (SD) of the TOEIC for the individual groups are as follows:
Pre+During-EI = 558.82 (67.00), Pre-EI = 556.35 (67.25), Post-EI = 574.00 (64.37), and the
control = 560.67 (63.45) for the -Prior Knowledge learners and Pre+During-EI = 608.86
(88.96), Pre-EI = 615.73 (54.25), Post-EI = 604.67 (78.05), and the control = 611.33 (64.82) for
the +Prior Knowledge learners.
2. Although the Post-EI and control groups were not informed before the writing task
that the past-counterfactual conditional was the target of instruction, these learners may
have been aware of the grammatical target because the TR test (pretest) contained a high
concentration of the target structure.
3. The number of distractors (n = 8), in comparison to the number of target items
(n = 8), might not have been sufficient to ensure that the participants were unaware of the
target structure.
4. However, for the between-group effect sizes, the difference between the Pre+DuringEI and the Pre-EI groups was notably larger for the -Prior Knowledge learners (1.82 and
1.15) than for the +Prior Knowledge learners (1.12 and 1.30). This result was presumably
due to the group differences in the pretest scores (see Table 4).

APPENDIX A
EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION (EI) SHEET
The original Japanese version is available online.
Grammar Rule Explanation
Expressions for people who tend to regret their past
You might sometimes wonder what would have happened if something that
happened in the past had not occurred. For example, you might have thought,
"If I had left 10 minutes earlier, I might have caught the last train." In English
such expressions require a special form. Let's take a look at the four steps for
composing such sentences.
1.Think about the meaning of the sentence you would like to produce. You
can use this structure when you hypothesize (explain something against
past facts) such as "if . . . had (not). . . ."
2.The sentence consists of two clauses.
1)If I had left 10 minutes earlier
If-clause, "If . . .": In the case of the above sentence--If I had left
10 minutes earlier (If I had left 10 minutes earlier)
2)I would have caught the last train
Main clause "would have": I would have caught the last train (I would
have caught the last train)
Look at the above sentence carefully.
1)An if-clause includes had + past particle
2)A main clause contains a past modal (would/should/could/might) +
have + past particle. The past modal helps you express regret. The
following perfect aspect (have + past particle) expresses that this is
about the past.
3.Either the if-clause or the main clause can come first. So either of the
following sentences is correct.
If I had left ten minutes earlier, I would have caught the last train.
I would have caught the last train if I had left ten minutes earlier.

TEXT RECONSTRUCTION TEST
Listening Text
A boring job
When he was young, Koji Nakano did not know what job he wanted to do.
His first idea was to become a lawyer. But he failed the entrance test for the
university. If he had become a lawyer he might have dealt with an important court case. His next plan was to become an English teacher. But he
found he was too shy to speak English. If he had become a teacher he
would have enjoyed long holidays every year. His parents wanted him to
become a doctor. But Koji was afraid of blood. If he had become a doctor
he would have earned a lot of money. Koji then thought maybe he could
become a vet. But he found that he had animal allergies. If he had become
a vet he would have been very happy. Next he thought about a musician.
But he just wasn't very musical. If he had studied music he might have
joined an orchestra. His next idea was to become an astronaut. But he was
frightened of heights. If he had become an astronaut, he would have been
very famous in Japan. Finally he decided to study economics and became
a tax officer.
