Two Assessments of American Usage
Frequencies for Ninety-Seven Sentence
Complement-Taking Nouns
Shelia M. Kennison1
Two studies documented the American English usage frequencies for ninety-seven nouns that occur
with sentence complements (e.g., "rumor," "The rumor that the student cheated . . ."). An established usage preference methodology was used (see Connine, Ferreira, Jones, Clifton, & Frazier,
1984; Kennison, 1999).2 In Study 1, participants completed short fragments that did not contain the
overt complementizer "that," as in "The rumor . . ." In Study 2, participants completed short sentence fragments that contained the overt complementizer, as in "The rumor that . . ." The results
showed that when the complementizer was absent (Study 1), bare (i.e., unmodified) usages and
prepositional phrase usages were frequently observed. In contrast, sentence complement and relative clause usages were rarely observed. When the complementizer was present (Study 2), the frequency of sentence complement and relative clause usages varied. The estimates of usage frequency
obtained in these studies are intended to be a resource for language comprehension researchers.

An important part of each language user's knowledge of language is information about the possible usages of words. A great deal of attention has
focused on documenting the possible usages of verbs (Hoover & Shaer,
1990; Levin, 1993) and the frequencies of those usages for specific verbs
(Connine et al., 1984; Garnsey, 1996; Kennison, 1999). Consider the verb
"expected." As shown in example 1 a-c, there are at least three possible

This sentence completion method is not the only method for assessing frequency of usage.
Some researchers have relied on calculating usage frequencies from samples taken from corpora (see Gibson & Pearlmutter, 1994; Hindle & Rooth, 1993). However, a recent comparison of the two methods by Merlo (1994) suggests that the sentence completion method is a
better predictor of behavior. One possible reason is that usage frequencies obtained at a given
University or vicinity are more representative of the population to be later studied in behavioral experiments than frequencies obtained from a corpora, which has been compiled using
a variety of language samples, such as newspapers and other printed or spoken sources.

usages. According to usage frequency estimates reported in Kennison (1999),
the verb "expected" occurs 26% of the time with noun phrase complements
(1a), 9.5% of the time with tensed sentence complements (1b), and 38% of
the time with infinitival complements (1c).

c. John expected to be elected

Infinitival complement
The role of verb-specific knowledge in language comprehension has
been the focus of research since the late 1960s. One of the earliest proposals was that comprehenders use their knowledge of the possible usages of a
specific verb to form expectancies about upcoming phrases in the sentence
(Clark & Clark, 1977; Clifton, Frazier, & Connine, 1984; Fodor, 1978;
Fodor & Garrett, 1967; Ford, Bresnan, & Kaplan, 1983; Mitchell, 1987;
Tanenhaus & Carlson, 1989). Consider the examples in 2, the verb
"pushed" can occur with a noun phrase complement, but the verb "fainted"
cannot. This knowledge may lead comprehenders to expect a noun phrase
complement following the verb in 2a, but not in 2b. As a result, comprehenders would likely experience more difficulty resolving the remainder of
the sentence in 2a than in 2b, as the intended interpretation is one in which
the noun phrase "the patient" is the subject of the main clause, rather than
the NP complement of the preceding verb.
(2) a. When the doctor pushed the patient laughed.
b. When the doctor fainted the patient laughed.
More recently, researchers have focused on the possibility that comprehenders use information about the relative frequencies of possible usages to
resolve ambiguous phrases. It is suggested (MacDonald, 1994; MacDonald,
Pearlmutter, & Seidenberg, 1994) that when verbs are comprehended, all
possible usages of the verb are activated in parallel and are considered as
potential analyses of the sentence being comprehended. The activation
levels of the potential analyses are believed to correspond directly to the
frequency with which the specific verb occurs with the different usages.
Prior and following sentence context can be used by comprehenders to activate the most appropriate analysis and to further inhibit competing analyses.
Consider the example in 3. The usage frequencies of NP complements
and tensed sentence complements differ for the verbs "accepted" and
"acknowledged." According to Kennison (1999), "accepted" occurs approximately 48% of the time with NP complements and approximately 2% of
the time with tensed S complements; "acknowledged" occurs approximately

12% of the time with NP complements and approximately 29% of the time
with tensed S complements. When each
(3) a. The student accepted the answer . . .
b. The student acknowledged the answer . . .
verb is comprehended, both NP complement and tensed S complement
analyses would become activated. However, the activation levels of these
analyses would differ for the two verbs. The NP complement analysis
would be the higher activated analysis for "accepted," but the lower activated analysis for "acknowledged." As a result, when the following NP "the
answer" is comprehended, it would be initially analyzed as an NP complement in 3a, but as the subject NP of a tensed S complement in 3b. There
has been several empirical investigations providing support for claims set
forth in the PAH. This support comes from a growing number of experiments, the results of which indicate that ambiguous phrases following verbs
are interpreted as being consistent with their most frequent usage (Gamsey,
Pearlmutter, Myers, & Lotocky, 1997; Holmes, Stowe, & Cupples 1989;
MacDonald, 1994; Mitchell, 1989; Mitchell & Holmes, 1985; Trueswell,
Tanenhaus, & Kello, 1993; but see also Ferreira & Henderson, 1990;
Kennison, 1995).
Despite the fact that the principles set forth in the PAH do not apply
exclusively to the use of verb-specific knowledge in comprehension, very
little attention has been paid to the use of knowledge of other syntactic
categories, such as, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. The purpose of the
research described in this paper was to document that a certain class of
nouns which occur in English have multiple usages and to assess the frequencies of these multiple usages in a way that would benefit language
comprehension researchers. The class of nouns that was the focus of the
present research was the class containing nouns like "rumor," which can
occur with prepositional phrase complements (4b and c) and sentence complements (4d), as well with as with relative clauses (4e) and without any
modification (4a). This class of nouns refer to abstract concepts. Other
examples of this type of noun are "fact," "belief," and "understanding." In
contrast, concrete nouns (e.g., "chair," "car," "fork.") do not occur with
either prepositional phrase complements ("* The car about the race . . .") or
sentence complements ("* The car that the driver died . . ."). Concrete
nouns, like all others, can occur with relative clauses ("The cause that the
driver crashed . . .").

Not only do nouns have multiple usages, as do verbs, but it is also the
case that nouns, like verbs, may be followed by temporarily ambiguous
phrases. The knowledge of usage frequencies may aid comprehenders in resolution of such ambiguities. Consider the example in 5. Clauses following this
special class of nouns (i.e., nouns that can occur with sentence complements)
can be temporarily ambiguous between sentence complements (5a) and relative clauses (5b).
(5) The rumor that the actress had . . .
a. fallen disturbed many of her fans.
b. denied disturbed many of her fans.

Sentence complement
Relative clause

There is been preliminary evidence that the resolution of this type of ambiguous clause is influenced by the frequency with which specific nouns are used
with sentence complements versus relative clauses (Kennison, 1998).
The two studies that are reported in the paper were conducted to assess
the usage frequencies for this class of nouns in English. Ninety-seven nouns,
like "rumor," "fact," and "belief," were initially identified. A considerable
effort was made to identify all nouns of this class. Three steps were particularly useful. A first step involved surveying the nouns listed in Francis and
Kucera (1982). A second step involved identifying verbs, which could be
categorized as "thought" verbs (e.g., understand, believe, and know) and
identifying the deverbal noun form (e.g., "understanding," "belief," and
"knowledge"). A third step involved identifying semantically related nouns
using a thesaurus. The usage frequencies were obtained using a usage preference methodology modeled closely on the one used initially by Connine
et al. (1984) and employed, since then, by a number of others (Gamsey, 1996;
Holmes et al., 1989; Kennison, 1999; Trueswell et al., 1993). This method
involves providing participants with a list of words (verbs in Connine et al.,
1984, Kennison, 1999,) or short sentence fragments containing target words
(also verbs in Gamsey, 1996; Trueswell et al., 1993) and instructing participants to provide sensible sentences containing those words or sentence fragments. The resulting sentences are then coded according to type of usage. The
frequencies of the different usages for each word are calculated.
For the studies reported in the present paper, participants were provided with a list of short fragments, a subset of which contained the target

nouns. In Study 1, target nouns were not followed by the complementizer
"that" (e.g., "The rumor . . ."). Consequently, the frequency of unmodified
and prepositional phrase usages could be obtained (as in 2a-c), as well as the
frequencies of sentence complements, relative clauses, and other structures.
In Study 2, target nouns were followed by the complementizer "that" (e.g.,
"The rumor that . . ."). As a result, the relative frequency of sentence complement and relative clauses usage could be obtained (see 2d-e). In both
studies, participants were instructed to write a sensible completion for each
sentence fragments.
STUDY 1
Method
Ninety-seven target nouns were divided into three sets and were intermixed with the same filler nouns. None of the filler nouns could be used
with sentence complements. In list 1, 36 target nouns were intermixed with
64 filler nouns. In list 2, 35 target nouns were intermixed with 61 filler
nouns. In list 3, 33 target, nouns were intermixed with 62 filler nouns. The
filler in lists 2 and 3 were taken from the set of fillers used in list 1. Each
list was randomized. Participants were presented with each noun in a short
sentence fragment (i.e., "The rumor . . ."). Each of the three lists was completed by fifty undergraduates from the University of Oklahoma. All participants were native speakers of America English, naive to the purpose of the
studies, and received course credit in exchange for participation.
Results and Discussion
In Study 1, participants responses were classified into the following
twelve categories:
(1) unmodified usage
The rumor was spread all over
school.
(2) prepositional phrase (of)
The rumor of war shocked everyone.
(3) prepositional phrase (other)
The agreement between them was
witnessed by a lawyer.
The story by the students was published in the paper.
The statement in the letter was
very disturbing.
The acknowledgment for winning
made him feel proud.

Missing cases occurred when participants failed to provide a sentence for a
noun. For these cases, "n" for the particular noun was reduced by one. For
cases in which participants' responses were illegible, of which there was a
single occurrence, the trial was also coded as missing and the "n" for the
particular noun was reduced by one. Table I displays a summary of noun
usages obtained in Study 1.
The results indicated that although there were as many as six usages for
most nouns, the most frequent usage was the unmodified (or bare) form. Clause
usages (i.e., sentence complements and relative clauses) were infrequent.
Seven nouns appeared in more than one list. These nouns provided an
opportunity to assess the reliability of the frequencies obtained in the
study. Individual chi-square tests were carried out for these seven nouns.
An alpha level of .007 was selected, as seven separate tests were carried
out on the same data set (.05/7) (see Myers & Well, 1991). Six of these
tests failed to approach significance (report: 2(6) = 4.43, p > .61; research:
2(4) = 0, p > .99; resolution 2(16) = 20.82, p >.18 settlement: 2(16) =
15.15, p > .51; and speculation: 2(7) = 12.35, p > .08]. The only significant result occurred for "information" 2(6) = 10.75, p < .007. These
results indicate that the usage frequencies obtained in this study are reliable for multiple assessment of six of the seven nouns. Correlational analy-

ses were attempted, although these tests were likely influenced by a restriction of range problem (see Myers & Well. 1991). The only fruitful analyses were conducted for the frequency of unmodified usages for the five
nouns that appeared in both lists 1 and 3 (i.e., "research," "resolution,"
"rumor," "settlement," and "speculation") (r =.97, p < .005) and for the
four nouns that appeared in both lists 1 and 2 (i.e., "information," "report,"
"resolution," and "settlement"), the correlation failed to reach significance
(r =.52, p > .23).

STUDY 2
Method
In Study 2, the three lists of target and filler nouns, which were used
in Study l, were modified for use in Study 2. Participants were presented
with each noun in a short sentence fragment (i.e., "The noun that . . ."). In
approximately 80% of the filler fragments, a word also followed the noun
(e.g., "The gravel on . . ." "The truck with . . .," and "The witness to
. . ."). Each of the three lists was completed by fifty additional undergraduates from the University of Oklahoma. All participants were native speakers of American English, naive to the purpose of the study, and received
course credit in exchange for participation.

Results and Discussion
In Study 2, participants' responses were classified as either a sentence
complement or a relative clause. Missing cases occurred when participants
failed to provide a sentence for a noun. For these cases, "n" for the particular
noun was reduced by one. For cases in which participants' responses were
illegible or ambiguous, the trial was also coded as missing and the "n" for the
particular noun was reduce by one. Table II displays a summary of noun
usages obtained in Study 2.
The reliability of usage estimates was also investigated for the seven
nouns that appeared in more than one list. Correlational analyzes yield
significant positive correlations between sentence complement usage and
relative clause usage for the four nouns that appeared in both lists 1 and 2
(i.e., "information"., "report", "resolution", and "settlement") (r = .91,
p < .05) and for the five nouns that appeared in both lists 1 and 3 (i.e.,
"research", "resolution", "rumor", "settlement", and "speculation") (r =.96,
p < .006). Individual chi-square tests were carried out for these seven

nouns. An alpha level of .007 was selected, as seven separate tests were
carried out on the same data set (.05/7) (see Myers & Well, 1991). Six of
these tests did not approach significance (information: 2(1) =.7.1, p >
.39, report: 2(1) = .37, p > .54; research 2(1) = 2.28, p > .13; resolution:
2(2) = .63, p > .73; settlement: 2(2) = 7.26, p > .02; and speculation:
2(1) = .78, p > .38]. The only significant result occurred for "rumor"
2(1) = 9.54, p < .002. These results indicate that the usage frequencies
obtained in this study are reliable for multiple assessments of six of the
seven nouns.
A comparison of the results of Study 2 with those obtained in Study 1
revealed that the presence of the complementizer in the sentence fragment
significantly influenced how the nouns were used by participants.
Significantly fewer sentence complements were produced when the overt
complementizer "that" was absent from the sentence fragment (Study 1)
than when the overt complementizer "that" was present (Study 2): [complementizer absent: 2% vs. complementizer present: 55%. F(1, 105) =
578, p < .001]. Significantly fewer relative clauses were also produced
when the overt complementizer "that" was absent from the sentence fragment (Study 1) than when the overt complementizer "that" was present
(Study 2): [complementizer absent: 2% vs. complementizer present: 44%,
F(1, 105) = 326, p < .001].

GENERAL DISCUSSION
Two usage preference studies are reported that assessed the usage frequencies for ninety-seven complement-taking nouns (e.g.. "The rumor that
the student cheated . . ."). In Study 1, participants completed sentence fragments containing nouns that were not followed by the overt complementizer
"that". In Study 2, participants completed sentence fragments containing
nouns followed by the overt complementizer "that." The results indicated
that when fragments did not contain the overt complementizer participants
produced significantly fewer sentence complements and relative clauses
than when fragments did contain the overt complementizer. Furthermore,
the results document that there is variation in the usage preferences across
nouns. These result are intended to be of use to researchers interested in the
storage and the use of lexically-based knowledge in language processing.
