Purpose: To draw on multiple sources of information to determine prevalence of
speech and language impairment in young Australian children.
Method: Information about 4,983 children (ages 4-5 years) from Growing Up
in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (Australian Institute of
Family Studies, 2007) was obtained via parent interviews and questionnaires, teacher
questionnaires, and direct assessment. Data were statistically weighted to the
Australian population of 253,202 children in the target age group.
Results: Parent-reported prevalence: 25.2% had concerns about how their child
talked and made speech sounds (11.8% "concerned"; 13.4% "a little concerned"),
and 9.5% had concerns about how their child understood language (4.4% "concerned";
5.1% "a little concerned"). Parents who reported concerns identified "speech not
clear to others" as the most frequent area of difficulty (12.0%). Teacher-reported
prevalence: 22.3% of children were considered to be less competent than others
in their expressive language ability (6.7% "much less competent"; 15.6% "less
competent"); 16.9% were considered to be less competent than others in their
receptive language ability (4.0% "much less competent"; 12.9% "less competent").
The match between parent and teacher identification was higher for expressive speech
and language concern than for receptive language. Direct assessment: 13.0% of
children were 1-2 SDs below the mean on the Adapted Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test-III (S. Rothman, 2003), and a further 1.7% were > 2 SDs below the mean. Parent
and teacher reports were significantly correlated with scores obtained via direct
assessment. Period prevalence: Parents and teachers reported that 14.5% of children
had accessed speech-language pathologist (SLP) services. 2.2% indicated that they
needed but could not access an SLP.
Conclusion: Multiple indicators of speech and language impairment in diverse
contexts confirmed the high prevalence of this condition in early childhood and a
concomitant need for SLP services.

peech and language competence affects children's ability to communicate effectively with adults and peers in the key contexts of
early childhood development--namely, the family, the child care
setting or school, and the community (Harrison, 2007). According to
Bronfenbrenner 's (1979) ecological model of development-in-context, children's experiences in the family and child care/school shape and inform
their lives. Thus, it is important to have context-specific information
about communicative competence and impairment in young children.

Identification of children with speech and language
impairment becomes particularly critical around age
4-5 years, when parents and teachers consider their children's readiness for formal schooling. When warranted,
diagnosis and intervention by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) is also sought at this time to ensure that
the children will be maximally successful in their future
educational and social endeavors. Intervention prior to
school is encouraged, as untreated childhood speech and
language impairment can have lifelong consequences
(Law, Boyle, Harris, Harkness, & Nye, 1998).

in the years prior to school tend to be smaller. For example, in France, Chevrie-Muller, Watier, Arabia, Arabia,
and Dellatolas (2005) studied 2,059 children who were
31/2 years old; in Australia, Zubrick, Taylor, Rice, and
Slegers (2007) assessed 1,766 two-year-olds; and in the
United States, King et al. (2005) assessed 513 three-yearold children. A summary of the results of these studies
(provided in Table 1) demonstrates that speech and language impairment continues to be regarded as a high
prevalence condition.

Prevalence estimates for communication impairment in young children are relied on by health and education services in order to plan for service provision.
However, the source of the information used to determine prevalence is an important consideration. Primary
informants are parents, teachers, and SLPs, but each
party has different expectations of children's communication. SLP diagnosis provides an objective assessment
of measurable features of the impairment. Parent and
teacher reports, on the other hand, consider the child's
communicative abilities in relation to performance expectations within a social or learning environment. Each
of these identification methods provides different yet
equally valuable insights into the prevalence of childhood speech and language impairment.

Diagnostic Methods Employed
for Identifying Prevalence of Speech
and Language Impairment

Prevalence of Speech and Language
Impairment in Children
Prevalence is the "proportion or percentage of cases
in a given population at a specified time" for a "normal rather than clinical population" (Law, Boyle, Harris,
Harkness, & Nye, 2000, p. 166). In their systematic
review of the literature, Law et al. (2000) found that, on
average, 5.95% (range = 2.28%-6.68%) of typically
developing children had primary speech and language
impairment. For primary language impairment only,
the prevalence estimate was 7.40% (range = 2.02%-
19.00%), and for primary speech impairment only, the
range was 2.30%-24.60%. Law et al. concluded that
speech and language impairment is a "high prevalence
condition" (p. 179) warranting specific consideration in
population screening. Since publication of the Law et al.
(2000) review, there have been 16 more epidemiological
studies of prevalence in children's speech and language
impairment (identified in Table 1). Many of these more
recent studies are based on very large samples of schoolaged children, determining prevalence in thousands
of children--for example, 26,315 eight-year-olds in Utah
(Pinborough-Zimmerman et al., 2007); 21,027 six- to
ten-year-olds in Belgium (Van Borsel et al., 2006); and
14,533 five- to eighteen-year-olds in Australia (McLeod
& McKinnon, 2007). Perhaps because of more difficulty
with recruitment, prevalence studies involving children

1214

Considerable variability has been noted in studies of
prevalence in speech and language impairment, as can
be seen in Table 1. The reasons for this variability include the definition of what constitutes a case, the severity and type of communication impairment that is
included in the definition, the nature of the surveyed
population, and differences in methodological procedures
(Law et al., 2000; Pinborough-Zimmerman et al., 2007).
Researchers have relied on three primary diagnostic
methods: parent report, teacher report, and direct assessment by an SLP or trained research assistant.
Studies regularly use parent and /or teacher report to
determine the prevalence of impairment, for their efficiency (Hall & Segarra, 2007; Klee, 2007) as well as the
high costs associated with direct assessment of children
(Pinborough-Zimmerman et al., 2007).
Parent report. Of the 16 studies reviewed and listed
in Table 1, three relied solely on parent report of communication difficulties. Keating, Turrell, and Ozanne
(2001) found that parents reported that 1.3% of 12,388
children aged 0-14 years had "difficulty talking, producing speech sounds, or who stuttered" (p. 431). Their
peak prevalence for males occurred at age 5 (6.5%), and
for females at 3-4 years (1.8%). However, higher levels of
overall prevalence have been reported in younger
children by Ttofari Eecen, Reilly, and Eadie (2008), who
reported 5.7% for 1-year-old children, and by Zubrick
et al. (2007), who reported a 13.4% level of late language
emergence in 2-year-old children.
It has been found that parent report has good sensitivity and specificity in identifying children with speech
and language impairment, particularly in young children. For example, O'Neill (2007) indicated that there
was high sensitivity and specificity on the Language Use
Inventory for Young Children (O'Neill, 2007), a parentreport measure for distinguishing between typically developing and language-delayed children. Rescorla and
Alley (2001) reported good reliability, validity, and clinical utility of the Language Development Survey ( LDS).

Norbury, Nash, Baird, and Bishop (2004) found that the
Children's Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-2) distinguished children with communication impairments from
nonimpaired peers.
Tomblin et al. (1997) combined parent report, screening assessment, and diagnostic assessment in their landmark study of the prevalence of language impairment
in 7,218 children who lived in the upper midwestern
United States. This study illustrated the variation in
results that are obtained by drawing on different sources
of data: 29% of parents indicated that their kindergarten
child had previously been identified as having speech
and language difficulties; 26.2% of children failed a language screening test; and 7.4% failed subsequent diagnostic language assessments.
Laing, Law, Levin, and Logan (2002) evaluated the
sensitivity and specificity of parent report and direct
assessment using the Reynell Developmental Language
Scales ( RDLS; Edwards et al., 1997) in a prospective
population-based study of children aged 30-36 months.
They found low sensitivity and specificity of parent report, health visitor report, and a screening test, and they
stated that none of these measures adequately identified
either typically developing children or children with serious language problems. Sachse and von Suchodoletz
(2008) also compared parent report and direct assessment. In contrast to Laing et al. (2002), they found that
parent report and direct assessment were similarly successful in identifying expressive language delay in 2- and
3-year-old children. However, Sachse and von Suchodoletz
(2008) indicated that expressive language ability was
more accurately identified by direct assessment in
3-year-olds. In contrast, for children ages 5-15 years,
Hutchison and Gordon (2005) found higher prevalence of
communication and hearing disability in the Office for
Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) records than
that identified by parent report.
Teacher report. Three of the 16 studies reviewed and
listed in Table 1 used teacher reports as the sole means
of identifying children with communication difficulties
(Chevrie-Muller et al., 2005; Okalidou & Kampanaros,
2001; Van Borsel et al., 2006), and three used teacher
report in combination with other methods of diagnosis
(Duff, Proctor, & Yairi, 2004; Jessup, Ward, Cahill, &
Keating, 2008a; McLeod & McKinnon, 2007). Teacher
report has received less scrutiny than parent report;
however, this method of assessing prevalence is seen as
having high content validity because teachers' opinions
are based on daily comparisons among students over
a wide range of behaviors. Furthermore, teachers are
frequently required to determine eligibility for special
needs support and funding (Ysseldyke & Thurlow, 1984).
Teacher report has been used to describe the prevalence
of communication impairment relative to other areas of
learning need in an Australian longitudinal study of more

1216

than 14,500 school-aged children (ages 5-18 years) from
one school district (McLeod & McKinnon, 2007). Identification occurred using a four-stage process involving
school-based training, teacher identification of cases, confirmation of case status by a relevant professional (e.g.,
SLP), and agreement by a team of special education advisors. Teachers reported communication disorders to
be the second most prevalent area of learning need after
learning difficulties. In the first wave of data collection,
13.04% of children were identified by their teachers (and
confirmed by an SLP report) as having a communication
disorder. A similar proportion (12.40%) was reported in
the second wave, conducted 2 years later. Lower prevalence rates are noted for teacher reports of communication impairment subtypes. For example, the prevalence
of stuttering was reported to be 0.58% in 21,027 children attending regular schools in Belgium (Van Borsel
et al., 2006) and 0.33% in a sample of 10,425 Australian
school-aged children (and confirmed by SLP assessment;
McKinnon, McLeod, & Reilly, 2007). McKinnon et al. also
reported that 0.12% of children had a voice disorder and
1.06% had a speech-sound disorder. They also indicated
that there was a decreasing prevalence of identified
speech-sound disorders, voice disorders, and stuttering
with increasing grade level for children in kindergarten
to Grade 6.
The validity of teacher reports has already been noted
in the studies by McKinnon et al. (2007) and McLeod and
McKinnon (2007), in which teacher diagnoses were confirmed by SLPs. In addition, studies have compared
teacher identification and direct assessment. Jessup,
Ward, Cahill, and Keating (2008b) compared teacher report and direct assessment of speech and language skills
for 286 kindergarten students. Agreement between direct assessment and teacher identification was 86.4%
for speech impairment and 71% for language impairment. They found high specificity rates for typical speech
(93%) and language (97%); however, they reported low
sensitivity for speech (50%) and language (15%) impairment. A second study by Williams (2006) compared teacher
report and direct assessment of language. In contrast to
Jessup et al. (2008b), Williams reported high sensitivity
for language impairment (86%) and lower specificity for
typical language (68.2%).
Correspondence among parent report, teacher report,
and direct assessment. Few studies have compared the
correspondence between the three primary methods
(parent report, teacher report, and direct assessment)
used to identify speech and language impairment in prevalence research. Duff et al. (2004) compared the
presence of voice disorders in 2,445 preschool children.
Through use of direct assessment by two SLPs, 3.9% of
the children were identified as having a voice disorder;
however, teachers' reports showed agreement with the
diagnosis in only 26.3% of cases, and parents' reports

showed agreement in only 25.7%. In contrast, Massa,
Gomes, Tartter, Wolfson, and Halperin (2007), in a study
of 73 seven- to ten-year-old children in the United
Kingdom, indicated that "parent ratings were shown to
provide distinct information about language function that
was at least as good as teacher ratings" (p. 100). Massa
et al. reported a significant relationship between the Observational Rating Scale (Semel, Wiig, & Secord, 1996)
scores and children's performance on standardized language and reading tests. It is difficult to draw conclusions
among these studies: Some studies have supported correspondence between direct assessment and parent / teacher
report, and some have reported marked differences.
Need for additional prevalence information. The
present review and that of Law et al. (2000) show that
there is a need for further research into the prevalence of
speech and language impairment. Despite the extent of
data collected to document the prevalence of children's
speech and language impairment and the growth of
large-scale studies, there has been no assessment of the
prevalence of childhood speech and language impairment
in a nationally representative sample. Furthermore, few
studies have considered the prevalence of speech and
language impairment in the years prior to formal schooling. Although there is an increasing focus on prevalence
research in very young children (under 3 years of age),
only limited data are available for prevalence estimates
in 4- to 5-year-old children. This information is particularly important for determining the need for SLP services
in health and early childhood educational settings.

referrals to SLP services in the Middlesbrough Primary
Care Trust, Broomfield and Dodd (2004) reported period
prevalence of 16.3% for primary communication disability and 14.6% for speech/ language disability. Of the
children referred for SLP services, 29.1% had speech
difficulties, 20.4% had receptive language difficulties,
16.9% had expressive language difficulties, 5.3% had
dysfluency, and 2.0% had voice or nasality disruption.
More males than females were referred, and the majority of referrals were for children ages 2-6 years.
Studies of period prevalence for accessing services are
less common than studies of prevalence of speech and language impairment. Thus far, no population studies have
simultaneously examined reported prevalence of speech and
language impairment and use of SLP services. Including
and comparing both of these reporting methods would
enable an estimate of unmet need within a population.

Aims
In the present study, we sought to estimate prevalence of speech and language impairment in a nationally
representative sample of 4- to 5-year-old Australian children by drawing on three sources of information: direct
assessment, parent report, and teacher report. The four
aims of the present investigation were as follows:
1.

To determine prevalence of speech and language impairment in a population-based sample of Australian
children ages 4-5 years as reported by parents,
teachers, and direct assessment.

Research that takes into account speech and language impairment within the diverse ecological contexts
of early childhood--namely, with parents and family members, teachers, and peers--is also needed. Children's interaction with others and their communicative performance
are likely to differ in different environments. Therefore,
the use of multiple sources of information about children's
speech and language capabilities can generate a more
comprehensive picture of prevalence as well as provide
an estimate of the correspondence among parent report,
teacher report, and direct assessment measures.

2.

To determine the prevalence of subtypes of speech
and language impairment as reported by parents.

3.

To determine the correspondence among the three
methods of identification of speech and language impairment: parent report, teacher report, and direct
assessment.

4.

To determine period prevalence of the use of SLP
services, as reported by parents and teachers, and
the correspondence between prevalence of speech
and language impairment and period prevalence for
accessing services.

Period Prevalence for Accessing
SLP Services

The data in this study are extended in the companion
article (Harrison & McLeod, in press) that uses the outcome measures identified in the present article to identify risk and protective factors for speech and language
impairment.

The epidemiology of speech and language impairment is also described by period prevalence of the
number of children receiving services at a certain period
of time (typically over the past year). According to the
U.S. Department of Education (2005) report for 2003,
24.1% of the 6.1 million children (ages 3-21 years) with
disabilities who were served in the public school system
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
( IDEA) received services for primary speech or language
disorders. In the United Kingdom, using figures for

Australian Children (LSAC; Australian Institute of Family Studies [AIFS], 2007; Sanson et al., 2002; Wake et al.,
2008). LSAC is the first comprehensive national study to
examine the lives of Australian children at regular intervals across infancy, early childhood, and middle childhood. Recruitment of the LSAC sample was via the
national Medicare database, the most comprehensive
database of Australia's population, and was facilitated
by the Australian government and the Health Insurance
Commission ( HIC). A target sample of 5,000 children
ages 4-5 years and 5,000 infants was sought. The present report focuses on the child cohort only.
The recruitment process ensured that the numbers
of children in each of the eight states and territories of
Australia, and within and outside each of their respective capital cities, were proportional to the total numbers of children resident in these areas (see Gray &
Sanson, 2005). A two-stage clustered design was chosen,
based on postcodes (zip codes). The first stage of sampling entailed selecting postcodes, and the second stage
sampled children within these postcodes, allowing analysis of children within communities. Stratification was
used to ensure proportional geographic representation
for states/territories and capital city statistical division /
rest of state areas. Postcodes were randomly selected,
with probability proportional to size selection where
possible and with equal probability for small population
postcodes. Because of excessive data collection costs,
some remote postcodes were excluded from the design,
and the population estimates were adjusted accordingly.
Children were randomly selected with approximately
equal chance of selection for each child (about 1 in 25).
The selection of children and corresponding fieldwork
occurred in four phases. This was done to enable sample
selection of children born across all months of the calendar year and to attempt to reduce the age range of
children at interview. The achieved response rate for the
final Wave 1 sample, after accounting for noncontact,
was 57% of families who were sent a letter by the HIC.
Broadly, the LSAC sample is representative of the Australian population with no large differences from 2001
Australian Bureau of Statistics Census data on most
characteristics--including, for example, Indigenous status.
Comprehensive details on the design and sample are available elsewhere (Soloff, Lawrence, Misson, & Johnstone,
2006).
With support from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Soloff et al. (2006, p. 5) developed weights to ensure "proportional geographic representation for states/
territories and capital city [and] rest of state areas" and
to compensate for differences between the final LSAC
sample and the national population. This process produced weights for the LSAC sample that were used as
expansion factors to allow the scaling of the sample to

1218

the population. LSAC weights reflect both the design
of the study (to allow for unequal probabilities of inclusion in the study that may result in sampling biases) and
likelihood of response (those less likely to respond are
given a higher weight, and those more likely to respond
are given a lower weight). A poststratification weighting system was used in all analyses to allow for any
nonresponse effects. As the survey design used both clustering and stratification in the sampling, this is also
accounted for in all relevant analyses. Analyses in the
present article entailed the use of sample weights. Thus,
the population weighted number of 4- to 5-year-olds was
253,202, and population weighted data has been used
throughout this article to represent the Australian
population.

Participants
A total of 4,983 children (2,537 boys, 2,446 girls) and
their parents participated in the child cohort of the LSAC
study. Children ranged in age from 4;3 (years;months) to
5;7, with the majority (80%) being within the 4;6-5;0 age
span. The mean age was 56.91 months (SD = 2.64) or 4;9.
The children were born between March 1999 and February 2000. A similar proportion of boys (50.9%) and girls
(49.1%) were included, and boys and girls did not differ by
age. Nearly half of the households contained 2 children
(47.5%), 26.8% had 3 children, and 14.2% had 4 or more
children. Only 11.5% of the children were only children.
Seventy-five percent of children were living in intactcouple families, 15% were in single-parent families, and
8.3% were in step-families. On other key characteristics
(ethnicity, country of birth, education and income, and
whether a language other than English was spoken at
home), the families were a close match to the Australian
population of families with a 4- to 5-year-old child (Gray &
Sanson, 2005).
The study informants used included the child's primary caregiver, the child her / himself through direct
assessment, and the child's teacher. Data collection
was conducted during a 1- to 2-hr home interview and
via two questionnaires. Interviewers were asked to complete the following tasks: (a) obtain detailed information
about the child, including his / her health and aspects of
social, cognitive, and behavioral development, from the
primary carer (the child's mother in over 97% of cases);
( b) obtain sociodemographic information on the family
(e.g., household structure and parental labor force status,
educational attainment and income); (c) provide a selfcomplete questionnaire for the primary carer, covering
aspects of the child's personality and behavior as well as
other areas of family functioning, health, and support,
to be completed while the interviewer was in the home or
to be mailed back; (d) administer the Adapted Peabody

of receptive language to the child; and (e) obtain consent
to contact the child's teacher and to acquire the relevant
postal address. Full information about the interviews and
content is available elsewhere (Soloff, Millward, Sanson,
LSAC Consortium Advisory Group and Sampling Design
Team, 2003).
Information provided by the primary carer indicated
that more than 95% of the LSAC children (n = 4,736)
were attending a regulated early childhood program
provided in a school, preschool, or child care center. With
parental permission, a letter was sent to the child's main
early education setting to explain the LSAC study and
invite the child's teacher to complete a mailback questionnaire. The teachers of 3,276 children returned the
questionnaire (a 69% rate of return). Of these, 21.7%
worked in a child care center, 59.5% worked in a preschool, 15.3% worked in a school, and 3.4% worked in
other education or care settings. To broadly assess the
representativeness of the sample for which teacher data
were available, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were
used to compare the two subsamples (children with
and without teacher data) on key demographic values,
including mother's age at birth, mother's and father's
level of education, family income, neighborhood disadvantage based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) Socio Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA; ABS,
2001), number of children in household, age and gender
of study child, Aboriginal/ Torres Straits Islander ( Indigenous) background, and exposure to a home language
other than English. Significant differences were noted
for mother's age (slightly older in the subsample of children for whom the teacher returned the questionnaire),
F(1, 4917) = 8.10, p = .004, h2 = .002; mother's years of
education (slightly higher in the teacher subsample),
F(1, 4913) = 6.93, p = .009, h2 = .001; father's years of
education (slightly higher in the teacher subsample),
F(1, 4909) = 5.92, p = .015, h2 = .001; family income
(slightly higher in the teacher subsample), F(1, 4947) =
10.92, p = .001, h2 = .002; SEIFA (slightly higher in the
teacher subsample), F(1, 4951) = 4.47, p = .045, h2 = .001;
and number of children in the family (slightly more
in the teacher subsample), F(1, 4951) = 4.50, p = .034,
h2 = .001. Children in the subsample for whom teachers returned the questionnaire were also less likely to
be from an Indigenous background, F(1, 4951) = 17.75,
p = .000, h2 = .004, or less likely to be exposed to a language other than English at home, F(1, 4976) = 7.34,
p = .007, h2 = .002, but did not differ by age, F(1, 4951) =
0.95, p = .758, h2 = .000, or gender, F(1, 4951) = 0,23,
p = .879, h2 = .000. Although these subsample differences
were significant, the measure of association for each test
was very small (h2s between .004 and .001), suggesting
that the actual differences were of minimal import.
Therefore, population weights were also applied to the

data provided by teachers. Note, however, that teacher
information was available for only 65.4% of the total
LSAC sample. This lower proportion is reflected in the
weighted outcomes.

Procedures
Parent, teacher, and child sources of data were used to
identify prevalence of speech and language impairment.
Parent report. Parents were interviewed about their
child's communication as part of a broad battery of items
about their child's health. Three questions were asked
about the child's speech and language: (a) Question 1:
"Do you have any concerns about how your child talks
and makes speech sounds?" ( b) Question 2: "Do you have
any concerns about how your child understands what
you say to him / her?" and (c) Question 3: "Do you think
your child was late in starting to talk?" The first two
questions were drawn from the Parent's Evaluation of
Developmental Status (PEDS; Glascoe, 2000). The PEDS
is reported to have good concurrent validity, sensitivity,
and specificity (Coghlan, Kiing, & Wake, 2003; Glascoe,
1994, 1996). For example, Glascoe (2000) reported that
for children who were identified with parental concerns
about speech and language, there was a 79% chance of
children being referred to SLP services at 3;6-4;0.
All parents were asked Questions 1, 2, and 3, with
Questions 1 and 2 being used as a screener for gathering
further details about any speech and language impairment. If some level of concern was indicated, parents
were then asked to identify if the problem was in any of
the following areas: (a) reluctant to speak; ( b) speech not
clear to family; (c) speech not clear to others; (d) difficulty
finding words; (e) difficulty putting words together; (f )
doesn't understand you when you speak; (g) doesn't understand others when they speak; ( h) voice sounds unusual; (i) stutters, stammers, or lisps; or ( j) other. As part
of the leave-behind questionnaire, parents were also
asked to report their use of or need for SLP services,
and other community services, for their children. The
items were (a) "In the past 12 months, have you used
(speech-language pathology) services for your child?"
( b) "In the last 12 months, have you needed (speechlanguage pathology) but could not get this service?"
Questionnaire data were available for 89.5% of the
LSAC sample.
Teacher report. Each child's teacher was asked to
rate a number of aspects of the child's developing skills
and competences, including aspects relating to speech
and language abilities, on a 4-point scale (1 = more competent than other children of a similar age, 2 = as competent as others, 3 = less competent than others, and 4 =
much less competent). Two items were used as indicators
of speech and language competence in the present study:

(a) expressive language skills (e.g., using language
effectively, ability to communicate ideas) and ( b) receptive language skills (e.g., understanding, interpreting,
and listening). Teachers were also asked to indicate
whether or not the LSAC child had received any additional services specifically available or provided through
the center/school to support learning. In cases where the
response was "yes," teachers were asked to identify the
type of services received, including any receipt of SLP
services provided through the center/school.
Direct assessment. The children were assessed by the
interviewer with a number of tests, including the Adapted
PPVT-III, a test of receptive vocabulary adapted especially for the LSAC study (Rothman, 2003). The Adapted
PPVT-III is a shortened version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III (PPVT-III; Dunn & Dunn, 1997).
Rasch modeling was applied to the results of preliminary testing of 215 children ages 3;7 to 5;6 using the full
PPVT-III. This process identified the best 40 items (core
set of 20 items, with additional basal and ceiling sets) for
use in a shortened version. For the LSAC sample, Rasch
estimates were determined for each item. Estimates
were transformed to generate a scale with a mean of
64 and an SD of 8 (Rothman, 2003). Further details on
scaling of the Adapted PPVT-III are available on the
LSAC Web site (AIFS, 2007). The Adapted PPVT-III was
administered directly to each child during the home interview. For each word presented, the child was shown a
card containing four pictures and was asked to point to
the picture corresponding to the word (e.g., "Show me
wrapping"). Scaled scores for the Adapted PPVT-III were
used in all analyses. Data were available for 87.8% of the
sample.

Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 12.0. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of
speech and language impairment as reported by parents
and teachers and via direct assessment. Similar analysis
procedures were used to describe communication impairment subtypes and combinations of impairment, as

reported by parents. Correspondence between parent
ratings (on a three-point ordinal scale) and teacher ratings (on a four-point ordinal scale) was analyzed using
cross-tabulation tables with c2 statistical tests. Correspondence between parent and teacher ratings of receptive language ability and directly assessed receptive
language /vocabulary was analyzed using comparison-ofmeans tests with ANOVA tests for linearity. The test of
linearity was selected as appropriate for use with the
three-point and four-point ordinal scales. All analyses
were undertaken using weighted scores for the entire
population.

Results
Prevalence of Speech
and Language Impairment
Parent report: Concern regarding speech and language impairment. Two questions from the PEDS scale
(Glascoe, 2000) provided an overall perspective on parents' concerns regarding speech and language impairment (see Table 2). Just over one quarter (25.2%) of
parents indicated that they had concerns (11.8% responded "yes", and 13.4% responded "a little") about
how their child talked and made speech sounds. A
smaller portion (9.5%) had concerns (4.4% responded
"yes", and 5.1% responded "a little") about how their
child understood what was said. Additionally, 18.0% of
parents indicated that their child was late in starting to
talk.
Parents who had a concern about their child's speech
and understanding were asked to indicate whether their
child exhibited 10 different aspects of speech and language difficulty, which represented seven subtypes of
impairment. Table 3 provides a summary of parental responses. The most frequently occurring area of difficulty
was articulation/phonology: 12.0% of parents gave a
"yes" response to "speech not clear to others," and 6.0%
said that "speech (was) not clear to the family." Other
areas of concern were "difficulty putting words together"
(5.8%); "stutters, stammers, or lisps" (5.6%); "difficulty

for the parents to elaborate their response.
Further analyses were then conducted to assess the
number and combination of multiple aspects of speech
and language impairment identified by parents. Table 4
indicates the number of aspects of speech and language
difficulty that were identified at the population level
(N = 253,202) and for the subsample of children (n = 66,780)
with parent-reported speech and language impairment.
Results showed that over half (54.2%) the subsample
of children with speech and language impairment exhibited only one aspect of speech and language impairment.

About one quarter (24.2%) had two aspects of speech and
language impairment. The proportion of children decreased
as the number of multiple problems increased, with a very
small number of children (2%) being identified as exhibiting seven or more different aspects of speech and language impairment.
Further examination of the data for children with
multiple speech and language difficulties generated 170
different combinations. The most common combination
was "speech not clear to others" and "speech not clear to
the family" (1.4% of the population). The next most common combinations were (a) "speech not clear to family,"
"speech not clear to others," and "stutters, stammers, or
lisps" (0.3% of the population); ( b) "speech not clear to
others," "difficulty finding words," and "difficulty putting words together" (0.3% of the population); and

others," and "difficulty putting words together" (0.2% of
the population).
Teacher report: Concern regarding speech and language impairment. As noted earlier, teacher ratings of
children's expressive and receptive language abilities
were provided for 65.4% of the total sample. Table 5 presents valid frequencies and percents derived from the
weighted data set. Teachers had concerns about the
expressive language skills of just under one quarter
(22.3%) of the children (15.6% received ratings of "less
competent" and 6.7% of "much less competent" than
other children of a similar age). For receptive language
skills, teachers indicated that they had concerns about
16.9% of the children (12.9% were rated as "less competent" and 4.0% were rated as "much less competent"
than others).
Correspondence between parent- and teacherreported prevalence. Cross-tabulation tables were used
to determine the degree of overlap between parents' responses to the PEDS questions and teachers' ratings of
the child's level of competence. Results are presented in
Table 6.
Expressive speech and language. Results showed a
good match between parents' responses to the PEDS
question "Do you have concerns about how your child
talks and makes speech sounds?" and teachers' ratings
of the child's "expressive language skills (e.g., using language effectively, ability to communicate ideas)." In general, as the teachers rated the children as less and less
competent, parents reported their children as having
more and more difficulties. Correspondence was best demonstrated by figures for the highest and lowest ratings of
speech and language abilities: 86.9% of children who were
identified by teachers as "more competent" than others in
expressive language skills were also identified by their
parents as having "no" difficulty in "talking and making speech sounds," and 74.1% of children identified by
their teachers as being much less competent than
others were also identified by their parents as having

difficulties (51.3% "yes" + 22.8% "a little"). A c2 test was
conducted to assess the strength of the match; results were highly significant, c2(6, 162,889) = 30,068.5,
p < .001, and achieved a medium-to-large effect size
( = .43; see Pallant, 2007).
Receptive language. A similar analytic approach was
taken to determine the overlap between parents' responses to the question "Do you have any concerns about
how your child understands what you say to him / her?"
and teachers' ratings for "receptive language skills (e.g.,
understanding, interpreting and listening)." Again, the
pattern of results showed that as teachers rated the
child as being less and less competent, parents reported
more difficulties. However, the overlap in identified impairment in receptive language was lower than that seen for
expressive language. For example, although 96.3% of children who were identified by teachers as "more competent"
than others in receptive language skills were also identified
by their parents as having "no" difficulty in "understanding," only 48.5% of children who were identified by teachers
as much less competent were also identified by their parents as having difficulties (31.0% "yes" + 17.5% "a little").
The c2 test was highly significant, c2(6, 162,973) = 20,241.3,
p < .001, and generated a medium effect size ( = .35).

Direct Assessment: Prevalence
of Receptive Language Impairment
Data on children's assessed receptive vocabulary
skills based on the scores on the Adapted PPVT-III were
available for 87.8% of the LSAC children. The mean
score for the Adapted PPVT-III was 63.63 (SD = 8.23;
minimum = 11.03, maximum = 84.07). The distribution
of these scores (converted to z scores) is illustrated in
Figure 1. A cutoff of more than 1 SD below the mean was
used to identify children with receptive language
difficulty: 14.7% of children fell within this group,
which consisted of the 13.0% of children who received a
score that was between 1 and 2 SDs below the mean and

three sources of data (parent report, teacher report, and

Period Prevalence for Accessing
SLP Services
Parent report: Accessing SLP services. Period prevalence for accessing services was calculated from information provided in the parent questionnaire, which
asked about the child's use of SLP services. Parents indicated that in the past 12 months, 10.5% of children had
accessed an SLP. In addition, 2.2% (n = 5,573) of parents
indicated that they needed but could not access SLP
services; however, of these, more than half (57.1%) indicated that they had accessed SLP services (i.e., they
had answered "yes" to both questions). Unfortunately, it
was not possible within the LSAC data collection schedule to probe for further details. Therefore, we do not know
if these children had initial difficulty accessing SLP services because of long waiting lists or if they were not able
to access their preferred SLP service.
Cross-tabulation tables were used to determine the
correspondence between the use of SLP services and
parent-identified concern about their children's speech
and language abilities. Results, presented in Table 7,
showed that SLP was used by less than half (49.2%) of
children whose expressive speech and language was a
concern (parents indicated "yes") and by only 17.4% of
children whose parents were "a little" concerned. A sizable
proportion of children whose parents were concerned

about their speech and language had not accessed SLP
services: 50.8% of children in the clearly concerned
group ("yes") and 82.6% of the children in the somewhat
concerned group ("a little"). Note, however, that some of
these parents indicated that their child needed but was
unable to access SLP services (12.2% of children in the
"yes" group; 4.3% in the "a little" group). It is not clear
whether the lack of take-up of SLP services was because
parents were unaware of the benefits of these services,
because they were unaware of how to access SLP, or for
other reasons.
Similar proportions were noted for the use of SLP
services for children identified by parents as having
receptive language difficulties: 41.6% in the clearly
concerned group ("yes") and 21.1% in the somewhat
concerned group ("a little") had accessed SLP services.
Further, 10.9% in the clearly concerned group ("yes")
and 5.3% in the somewhat concerned group ("a little")
indicated that they were unable to access SLP services.
Finally, it is worth noting that there were a number of
children whose parents did not indicate concern yet had
used SLP: 3.2% for expressive language ("no" concern
about how their child talks and makes speech sounds) and
8.4% for receptive language ("no" concern about how their
child understands what they say). This may have been due
to resolution of the problem during SLP or only seeking
SLP advice on typical speech and language acquisition.
Teacher report: Accessing SLP services. Teachers
reported on any services supplemental to the early childhood program that had been used by the LSAC child at
their school, preschool, or child care center since the
children had been in their classes. A total of 8.0% of children received additional services to support the study
child's learning, of which the majority (5.8%) received
SLP services. Results presented in Table 8 showed that
SLP services were used by more children than any other
service: 3.9% received learning support, 1.3% received
behavior management, 0.7% had a psychological assessment, and 3.5% received other services.

the weighted total population, which includes 34.9% of children for whom
teacher ratings were not available. Thus, the weighted population was
164,723.

The correspondence between the use of SLP services
in the school /child care center and teacher-reported concern for expressive and receptive language competence
was examined using cross-tabulation tables. Results are
presented in Table 9. Only one third of children whose
speech and language was a concern to their teachers
were accessing SLP services at their school, preschool, or
child care center (32.7% who were much less competent
with expressive language and 33.8% who were much less
competent with receptive language). Conversely, almost
two-thirds of children whose teachers were concerned
about their speech and language had not accessed SLP
services at school. This low take-up of services is likely
because SLP services are not available in many schools,
preschools, or child care centers in Australia (Speech Pathology Australia, 2001), as these services are not legislated
(unlike in countries such as the United States and the
United Kingdom). Finally, there were a few children
whose teachers did not indicate concern yet who had
used SLP services. This may have been due to resolution
of the problem as a result of SLP services.
Period prevalence for accessing SLP services: Parent
and teacher report. Parent and teacher reports of the use
of SLP services were compared and combined in order
identify the total number of children who had received
SLP services in the last 12 months. Overall, 14.5% of

children were receiving SLP either organized by the
school, preschool, or child care teacher and /or organized
by their parents (accounting for overlaps between parent and teacher reports). Additionally, 2.2% of parents
reported that they needed but could not access SLP
services in the past year. There was no equivalent question asked of the teachers, so the extent of unmet need is
unknown.

Discussion
Prevalence
The primary conclusion to be drawn from these new
Australian data from a nationally representative sample of 4- to 5-year-old children is that speech and language impairment in young children is a high prevalence
condition. The study provides additional support to previous research but extends this support by drawing on
and comparing multiple sources of information about
prevalence. One quarter (25.2%) of parents indicated
that they had concerns about how their child "talks and
makes speech sounds" (11.8% responding "yes" and
13.4% responding "a little"), with a smaller proportion
(9.5%) having concerns about how their child understands what is said (4.4% responding "yes" and 5.1% responding "a little"). Difficulties were noted in many
aspects of speech and language impairment: being understood by others (12.0%) and their family (6.0%),
"putting words together" (5.8%), stuttering (5.6%),
"finding words" (5.1%), comprehending family (2.7%) and
comprehending others (2.3%), "being reluctant to speak"
(2.2%), and having a voice that "sounded unusual" (2.2%).
Teachers reported a similar level of concern about children's speech and language: 22.3% of children were
considered to be less competent (15.6%) or much less
competent (6.7%) than others in their expressive
language ability, and 16.9% were considered to be
less competent (12.9%) or much less competent (4.0%)
than others in their receptive language ability. A third
source of information was provided by direct assessment of receptive language using the Adapted PPVT-III.
This assessment identified 14.7% of children as being of
concern.

Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecological model of development-in-context highlights the importance of the family and child care/school contexts in children's lives. The
present study aimed to provide context-specific information about the communicative competence of young
children as they transition to formal schooling, recognizing that informants from each context bring with
them different expectations. In the present study, there
was a highly significant match between parents' and
teachers' ratings for expressive speech and language
abilities. Scores from the direct assessment of receptive
language were moderately associated with teachers'
ratings for receptive language abilities and weakly associated with parents' ratings of receptive language
concern. It is not surprising that teachers' ratings of
competence were more closely linked with PPVT-III scores
than parents' ratings of concern, as teachers' judgments
are likely to be based on a greater knowledge of language
development and a wider experience of receptive language ability in early childhood. In fact, the finding that
correspondence across the three sources of information
about receptive language impairment varied by informant further supports the view that each provides a
valid but different way of determining prevalence within
a large population sample.

primary language impairment, and primary speech impairment. They are also within the range of the more recent studies reviewed in Table 1. Applying the present
findings to recent Australian prevalence data (Jessup
et al., 2008a; McKinnon et al., 2007; McLeod & McKinnon,
2007), parents and teachers are concerned about the
speech and language of up to a quarter of preschool and
early school-aged children.

Only a limited number of previous studies have
compared the concerns of parents and teachers with
direct assessment. Some studies have found a correspondence among parent report and /or teacher report
and direct assessments (e.g., Sachse & von Suchodoletz,
2008; Williams, 2006), whereas others have demonstrated
marked differences between the three methodologies (e.g.,
King et al., 2005; Laing et al., 2002; Tomblin et al., 1997).
In the present study, the degree of association between
parent and teacher reports differed by type of communication, being stronger for expressive language than for
receptive language. The weaker association for receptive
language is consistent with the results for directly assessed receptive vocabulary and point to the differing
expectations of teachers and parents within different
contexts of language function. Parents may be reporting
on their child's understanding of what they or others
said, whereas teachers may be reporting on a broader
range of receptive language abilities, including listening
and interpreting as well as understanding.

Parents participating in the LSAC reported that
10.5% of children had accessed SLP services. A lower
figure (5.8%) was reported by teachers. However, SLP
services were the most frequently accessed service that
was provided at the child care center or school. After combining parent and teacher reports, a summary figure of
14.5% was generated for the proportion of children identified as having accessed SLP services in the past year.

Despite these differences, however, the prevalence
figures reported in the present study were similar across
the sources of identification. For expressive speech and
language, the prevalence was 25% ( parent report) versus 22% (teacher report). For receptive language, the
prevalence was 9.5% (parent report) versus 16.9% (teacher
report) versus 14.7% (direct assessment). The figures
are higher than the median figure of 5.95% identified by
Law et al. (2000) but are within the range provided by
Law et al. (2000) for speech and language impairment,

1226

A number of studies have indicated that as children
become older, the prevalence of speech and language impairment decreases (e.g., McKinnon et al., 2007; McLeod &
McKinnon, 2007). This may be due to resolution of difficulties as a result of targeted intervention, environmental
intervention, or spontaneous recovery. For example, a number of studies of late talkers have found that many of these
children performed within the average range when they
were school-aged (Paul, Murray, Clancy, & Andrews, 1997;
Rescorla, 2002). However, even though they performed
within the average range on speech, language, and reading tests, a number of these children were still performing
below their peers who were not identified as late talkers.

Period Prevalence for Accessing
SLP Services

Parents indicated that 2.2% of children needed but
could not access SLP services, but at least half did access
the services. Teachers were not asked a question about
lack of access to services, so the full extent of unmet need
is not known. However, considering the fact that almost
a quarter of parents and teachers reported concerns
about children's speech and language yet only 14.5% of
children received SLP services, then clearly there are
many children whose parents did not access or did not
have access to professional support to alleviate or confirm their concerns. Thus, it appears that there is a high
level of unmet need for SLP services in Australia. Australia does not have legislation that mandates services
for children with communication impairment (such as
the IDEA [U.S. Department of Education, 2005]), which
likely contributes to the higher rate of unmet need than
is reported in countries that do legislate services.

Limitations
One of the major limitations of the study was that
direct assessment was only available for receptive

language, and expressive speech and language skills
were not directly assessed. Additionally, the Adapted
PPVT-III assessed only receptive single-word vocabulary, which may have resulted in underidentification of
some children with language impairment who may have
had difficulty with sentence- and discourse-level morphology and syntax. Another limitation was that the
teachers were not asked about the subtypes of communication impairment, nor were they asked about unmet
need with respect to accessing SLP services. These
limitations are being addressed in a new research study
being undertaken by the authors that will extend and
complement the assessments used in the LSAC design,
with more detailed reports from teachers as well as
specific tests of speech and language ability (McLeod,
Harrison, & McAllister, 2007-2009).

Future Directions
We are presently exploring three major future directions to build on the foundational work presented
in this article. First, a companion paper (Harrison &
McLeod, in press) further examines these epidemiological
data to describe risk and protective factors for the different indicators of speech and language impairment in
4- to 5-year-old children. This and the present article
together address the need (identified by Law et al., 2000)
"for large-scale cohort studies to tease out the relationship between the component parts of the equation across
time and to establish a better understanding of the incidence of speech and language delays. More attention
needs to be paid to the risk and protective factors and the
extent to which they are influenced by confounding
variables and their interactions" (p. 184). Second, we are
undertaking a study using principles outlined in the
Tomblin et al. (1997) study to directly assess a subset of
children identified as having speech concerns by their
parents and teachers. Third, we are analyzing subsequent waves of the LSAC to explore the change, over
time, for point prevalence of speech and language impairment and period prevalence for accessing services
(Harrison, McLeod, Berthelsen, & Walker, 2009).

Conclusions
The results of an analysis of a nationally representative study of 4- to 5-year-old Australian children indicate that speech and language impairment is a high
prevalence condition, with unique yet consistent findings for parent- and teacher-reported outcomes and direct assessment. Although the majority of children who
were identified as having communication impairment
had received SLP services over the past year, parent and
teacher reports suggest that there is a large unmet need
for SLP services. The analyses presented in this article

provide a valuable baseline for examining the progress
of these children over the course of the LSAC. The present and future findings can also be used to inform the
identification of children with speech and language
impairment and the planning of provisions for health
and educational support.
