Abstract This study examined subject-object asymmetry and developmental sequence in
the second language (L2) acquisition of three types of wh-extraction, i.e., English headed
relatives, headless relatives, and embedded wh-questions. Sixty-four L1 Korean learners
of English completed an elicited imitation task and a grammaticality judgment task. The
learners demonstrated a subject advantage in the headed RCs and headless RCs, but an
object advantage in the embedded wh-questions, which suggests that they treat embedded
wh-questions differently from headed relatives and headless relatives despite the similarities
in surface forms. The learners further demonstrated the order of developing headless RCs
followed by embedded wh-questions, and subsequently headed RCs, which supports the
primacy of headless relatives as a simple nominal in L2 development.

Introduction
A large body of literature has investigated the second language (L2) acquisition of English
relative clauses (RCs), with particular attention to the disparity between the subject versus
object positions as the site of extraction within the RC. This draws upon Keenan and Comrie's
(1977) Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy (NPAH) hypothesis and its implications on
language acquisition (Comrie 2007). The NPAH hypothesis predicts that, from a typological
perspective, if a language relativizes an NP in the hierarchy, then any other NP in a higher
position can also be relativized. Subjects are highest in the NPAH, followed by direct objects,
indirect objects, obliques, genitives, and objects of comparison. There is general consensus

that RCs with direct object gaps are more difficult to process and acquire than RCs with
subject gaps in L2 acquisition (Doughty 1991; Eckman et al. 1988; Gass 1979).
While the NPAH hypothesis only addresses headed RCs, a question arises whether subjectobject asymmetry, which has been observed in the acquisition of headed RCs, can be extended
to other types of filler-gap dependencies, such as headless RCs and wh-questions. In examining the L2 acquisition of extraction structures involving the occurrence of a relative pronoun
or wh-question word in the initial position of a dependent clause, with a gap in the place
where the argument would be expected, this study chose to look into headless relatives and
embedded wh-questions, as well as headed RCs. This is in part due to the fact that headless
RCs and embedded questions are similar in surface form (e.g., `I eat what you cook (headless
RC)' vs. `I wonder what you cook (embedded wh-question)' from Ott 2011). This research
further aimed to examine the developmental order that L2 learners of English demonstrate
for headed relatives, headless relatives, and embedded wh-questions.
To pursue these goals, sixty-four L1 Korean learners of English, of three different proficiency levels, participated in an elicited imitation task and a grammaticality judgment task.
Korean learners of English are a good testing ground in that RCs and wh-questions involve
different learning mechanisms in the two languages. In English, both RCs and wh-questions
involve wh-movement and the filler-gap dependencies that necessarily result. However, in
Korean wh-words typically stay in situ (i.e., they remain in their canonical subject/object
position in the sentence), and thus wh-questions are syntactically distinct from RCs. Therefore, the processes underlying comprehension and acquisition of these two kinds of structures
in Korean may be less similar than they are in English. In pursuing these goals, two tasks,
elicited imitation and grammaticality judgment were employed, considering the inconsistent
findings depending on the tasks used in previous studies. While studies using an elicited
production task (e.g., Jeon and Kim 2007) or a sentence combination task (e.g., Ozeki and
Shirai 2007) generally demonstrated evidence in support of the NPAH effect while those that
used a sentence comprehension task (e.g., Yabuki-Soh 2007) or naturalistic data (Ozeki and
Shirai 2007; Yip and Matthews 2007) showed little evidence for the NPAH effect.

Acquisition of Relative Clauses
A relative clause is a dependent clause that modifies a noun in a matrix clause. Different
hypotheses have been proposed to account for subject-object asymmetry in the acquisition of RCs: the conjoined-clause analysis hypothesis and the structural distance hypothesis
are arguably the two most prominent of these. The conjoined-clause analysis hypothesis
(Tavakolian 1981) suggests that learners at an early stage of RC comprehension tend to interpret sentences with RCs as though they were conjoined sentences. This hypothesis would
therefore predict that the subject relative in (1a) below would be processed as `this is the
girl and met the boy,' which might not be possible for language learners to make sense of.
In objective relatives, on the other hand, the conjoined analysis would enable learners to
interpret the sentence in (1b) below as `this is the girl and the boy met,' which is preferable
to the conjoined analysis of the subject relative (Friedmann and Novogrodsky 2004). This
hypothesis yields a prediction that learners would show better performance in processing
object relatives than they would with subject relatives.

The structural distance hypothesis states that the distance between the filler and gap, or the
depth of embedding of the gap, can constrain the acquisition order of various types of RCs
(O'Grady 1997; Wolfe-Quintero 1992). The structural distance hypothesis entails two phases
of movement: (1) moving an element (a subject or direct object) within the RC to the left
periphery of the embedded clause or spec-CP (complementizer phrase), and (2) indexing the
spec-CP to the relative head. In (1a) above, the head of the RC, `the girl' is co-indexed with
the subject position of the embedded clause. Sentence (1b) includes a further movement of
`the girl' from an object position, which might pose more difficulty for language learners than
the subject relative in (1a). The structural distance hypothesis therefore predicts that English
subject relatives as in (1a) are acquired before their direct object counterparts as in (1b), due
to the shorter distance between the head noun and the gap created at the site of extraction.
Moreover, the challenge associated with the second phase of movement, i.e., relating the left
periphery of the embedded clause (spec-CP) to the relative head by co-indexation, accounts
for the occurrence of headless relatives before that of headed relatives in L2 development
(Friedmann and Novogrodsky 2004). More discussion is made on the acquisition of headless
relatives in the ensuing section.

Acquisition of Headless Relatives
Previous research (Bresnan and Grimshaw 1978; Ott 2011; Riemdsdijk 2006) has looked
into headless relatives in relation to embedded wh-questions. There is consensus that headless RCs and embedded wh-questions behave differently, despite similarities in surface form
(e.g., `I eat what you cook (headless RC)' vs. `I wonder what you cook (embedded whquestion)' from Ott 2011). Both constructions show CP properties, requiring wh-movement
from the object position of "cook" to the internal left periphery. Embedded questions have
a clause type, selected by the matrix verb and attracting the wh-element (Ott 2011). However, headless RCs do not have a clause type, but simply replace DP (determiner phrase)
or PP (preposition phrase) arguments, serving as subjects, complements, and adjuncts. That
is, they tend to have the distribution of a nominal, and the wh-phrase does not match selection requirements of the matrix predicate (Caponigro and Pearl 2009; Ott 2011; Riemsdijk,
2006).
As far as developmental patterns of headless RCs are concerned, Flynn and Lust (1980)
investigated L1 acquisition of the construction (e.g., `Cookie Monster hits what pushes Big
Bird') in relation to lexically headed RCs, specified (e.g., `Big Bird pushes the balloon which
bumps Ernie') versus unspecified (e.g., `Ernie pushes the thing which touches Big Bird')
for English-speaking children whose ages ranged from 3; 6 to 7; 7 years. The study used
two tests for different purposes: an elicited imitation task to test structural representations,
and an act-out task to test semantic comprehension. It was found in the elicited imitation
task that headless RCs are more frequent and target-like than headed RCs, regardless of the
semantic determinacy of the head (e.g., `Big Bird pushes the balloon which bumps Ernie';
`Ernie pushes the thing which touches Big Bird'). Results from the act-out comprehension
task revealed that there was no difference between children's interpretation of the headless
RCs and the unspecified headed relatives, and that both of these were more difficult for
children to comprehend than the specified headed relatives. The results suggest that children
are sensitive to different structures of RCs, and show preference of the headless RCs based
on their structure, independently of the semantic determinacy. An error analysis revealed
that headless RCs were easier for children because they allow a simple nomination of a

relativized clause, which is compatible with the structural account of headless RCs noted
earlier (Bresnan and Grimshaw 1978; Ott 2011; Riemsdijk, 2006).
Using the same experimental procedure as Flynn and Lust's (1980) L1 study with monolingual English-speaking children, a series of studies led by Flynn (Berkes and Flynn 2012a, b)
investigated the L2 and L3 acquisition of headless RCs in relation to specified and unspecified headed RCs, with emphasis on the developmental patterns of CP structure. L1 Japanese
speakers of L2 English and L1 German speakers of L2 English performed better on headless RCs than on the lexically headed RCs, whereas an L1 Spanish group did not show any
difference in performance across the three types of RCs. Considering the match between
Spanish and English in CP properties, the authors argued that the headless RC structure is a
developmental precursor to the lexically headed form in that the L1 Spanish learners would
have drawn upon their L1 knowledge of CP structure. The primacy of headless RCs was
further supported by the L3 study with an adult group of L1 Kazakh / L2 Russian learners of
L3 English (in which the CP properties of L2 and L3 match one another, but not the L1, in
constituent word order within the RC) and L1 Hungarian / L2 German learners of L3 English
(in which the CP properties of L1 and L3 match one another, but not the L2, in terms of
constituent word order within the RC).

Acquisition of Wh-Questions
A great deal of empirical research has addressed the developmental stages of question
formation in L2 acquisition with different foci. Research by Pienemann and colleagues
(Pienemann 1989; Pienemann et al. 1988) proposed that there is a fixed universal order
of acquisition of question forms, addressing L2 learners' developmental readiness to attest
the processability and learnability of structures in a target language. This proposal has
been employed to answer various research questions, such as the contribution of interaction and instruction to L2 development and its patterns (e.g., Mackey 1999; Spada and
Lightbown 1999). In this framework, embedded questions tend to emerge later in the development of L2 English question formation, presumably because L2 learners might have to
re-learn or cancel the wh-phrase inversion rule that they may have established in their L1
system.
Lee (2008) extended the L2 literature on question development by comparing argument wh-questions (what and who) and adjunct wh-questions (how and why). She used a
grammaticality judgment task with adult L1 Korean learners of L2 English. The results
demonstrate an argument-adjunct distinction: the learners were more successful in judging the (un)grammaticality of what and who questions than how and why questions. More
recently, Pozzan and Quirk (2014) examined main versus embedded questions, yes/no versus wh-questions, and wh-words as arguments (who and what) versus as adjuncts (why
and where), as well as the role of L1 properties (Chinese versus Spanish) in adult L2
acquisition. They used an elicited production task with L1 Chinese and L1 Spanish adult
learners of English. Unlike the argument-adjunct asymmetry found in Lee's study, their
research showed a significant effect of why-questions--while why-questions in matrix questions were associated with lower inversion rates than other wh-questions, learners produced
higher rates of target-like non-inverted embedded why-questions than other embedded whquestions.
Of note is that both Lee (2008) and Pozzan and Quirk (2014) used wh-questions with
direct object gaps as argument questions, which makes it impossible to look into a subject-

123

object distinction in the L2 acquisition of wh-questions. To address this void, the current
study has looked into a subject-object distinction in the L2 acquisition of wh-questions.
In doing so, this study used embedded wh-questions that look similar to headless RCs on
the surface, while pursuing the well-studied subject-object asymmetry in the domain of
RCs.

Testing Hypotheses About L2 Acquisition of Relative Clauses and
Embedded Wh-Questions
Two accounts have been put forward with respect to subject-object asymmetry in L2 acquisition of headed RCs, headless RCs, and embedded wh-questions: a learnability approach
to the acquisition of extraction and a structure-based approach. The learning principles were
proposed by Wolfe-Quintero (1992), to predict a developmental sequence of RCs and whquestions in English. Drawing upon Keenan and Comrie's (1977) relativization hierarchy
and its implications on acquisition (Comrie 2007), this approach to RCs in L2 acquisition attributes the subject-object contrast to differences in the depth of embedding of the
gap (Wolfe-Quintero 1992; O'Grady 1997). That is, the more deeply the extracted noun
is embedded, the more difficult it is to process and acquire. When a constituent does not
occur adjacent to the constituent with which it normally co-occurs, this results in a discontinuous phrase that may be embedded at different levels of a syntactic structure. The
learnability approach to the acquisition of various levels of embeddedness associated with
extraction predicts the initial stage production of RCs or wh-questions without any movement or extraction, by means of resumption or canonical word order. The next steps would
be to learn to front the relative or wh-pronoun and to leave a gap. It is not likely that a
learner could produce extraction within three levels of embeddedness without already being
able to produce extraction within fewer levels. It was further proposed that, in English,
both RCs and wh-questions exhibit the same type of extraction (Wolfe-Quientero, 1992:
50).
Contrary to the treatment of RCs and wh-questions as the identical type of extraction in
the learnability approach, a structure-based approach proposed by Stromswold (1995) posits
that learners demonstrate different rates and routes for different grammatical constructions,
such as RCs and wh-questions. On the basis of analysis of the CHILDES transcripts of
12 English-speaking children, she uncovered that object wh-questions were acquired at the
same age or earlier than subject wh-questions in L1 acquisition of English, and attributed
the acquisition order to the underlying difference in structural properties. Stromswold (1995;
pp. 10-11) noted that complement traces (object traces) and non-complement traces (subject and adjunct traces) are governed in different ways, and that government of subject
traces is less local and less direct than government of object traces, drawing on Lasnik
and Saito's (1984) proposal that the proper government of traces can be accomplished
through theta-government or antecedent-government. Lee (2008) provided supporting evidence for a structure-based account, albeit in terms of an argument-adjunct asymmetry
in subject-auxiary inversion in the L2 acquisition of wh-questions, as discussed earlier.
Taken together, the structure-based account predicts that rather than treating headed RCs,
headless RCs, and embedded wh-questions as the same type of extraction, learners will
demonstrate different rates and patterns for the structures in terms of a subject-object-gap
distinction.

The First Language Properties
Although Pozzan and Quirk (2014) reported that the L1 is not a predictor of L2 learners'
production for either main or embedded questions, it is worthwhile to describe the linguistic
properties of the present participants' L1, Korean, in comparison to English, in terms of
the target structures, headed RCs, headless RCs, and embedded wh-questions. In English,
both RCs and wh-questions involve wh-movement and filler-gap dependences. However, in
Korean, wh-words typically stay in situ (i.e., they remain in their canonical subject-object
position in the sentence), and thus wh-questions are distinct from RCs. The RC in Korean
precedes the noun it modifies, and relativization is marked by adnominal verbal suffixes
that convey the tense of the embedded clause. The cognitive mechanisms underlying the
comprehension and acquisition of RCs and wh-questions in Korean may be less similar than
they are in English.
When it comes to acquisition of RCs in Korean, previous studies have reported that
subject relatives are more frequent and accurate than direct object relatives in naturalistic
production by L1 Korean children (Kim 1987) and in elicited production by L1 English adult
learners of L2 Korean (Jeon and Kim 2007; Kang 2014). With respect to acquisition of whquestions in Korean, Clancy (1989) reported that in the naturalistic, longitudinal production
and comprehension of two Korean children (aged 1 year 8 months to 2 years 8 months for one
child and 1 year 10 months to 2 years 10 months for the other child), direct object wh-questions
occurred earlier than subject wh-questions. Wh-words with the copular in mue ya 'what is' and
eti isse 'where is' appeared first in the two children's production and comprehension. What
as a direct object of a lexical verb (e.g., mue hay 'what do (you do)?') and elliptical `why?'
were next to be acquired, followed by nwu 'who' as a subject and way 'why' in sentences.

Research Questions and Predictions
Drawing upon the literature on acquisition of headed relatives, headless relatives, and whquestions, this study aims to answer the following research questions:
1. Do L2 learners show a subject-object asymmetry in the L2 acquisition of English headless
relatives and embedded wh-questions, as well as headed relatives?
Prediction: If Wolfe-Quintero (1992)'s proposal is right, the same kind of asymmetry across
the target structures is predicted, either an object advantage throughout as proposed by the
conjoined-clause analysis (Tavakolian 1981) or a subject advantage proposed by the structural
distance hypothesis (O'Grady 1997). If Stromswold (1995)'s proposal is right, the learners
will show a different kind of subject-object asymmetry across the target structures.
2. What is the developmental order that adult learners of L1 Korean L2 English demonstrate
for English headed relatives, headless relatives, and embedded wh-questions?
Prediction: (1) English headless relatives will be acquired before headed relatives, drawing
on the primacy of headless relatives over headed relatives in the acquisition literature (Berkes
and Flynn 2012a, b; Flynn and Lust 1980; Kim 1987; Lee 1991); (2) the L2 learners will find
headless relatives easier than embedded wh-questions on the basis of the previous analysis
of headless relatives as a nominal as opposed to embedded wh-questions as a complex clause
type (Caponigro and Pearl 2009; Ott 2011; Riemsdijk, 2006); and (3) embedded wh-questions
will be easier than headed relatives for the L2 learners in that the latter requires co-reference
between a relative pronoun in the spec-CP and the lexical relative head (Friedmann and
Novogrodsky 2004).

Methods
Participants
Sixty-four Korean speakers (41 female), residing in a Midwestern university community at
the time of data collection, participated in the study. They ranged in age from 19 to 37 years
(M = 25 years 9 months). Twenty native speakers of English (14 female) participated as
a control group, whose age ranged from 18 to 22 years (M = 20 years 4 months). The L2
speakers all reported Korean as their dominant/first language and moved to the U.S. or an
English-speaking country after the age of 12. The age of arrival for the Korean-speaking
participants ranged from 12 to 35 years (M = 21 years 6 months, S D = 5 years 6 months).
The L2 learners reported having been in the U.S. from 9 months to 13 years (M = 3 years
9 months, S D = 3 years 3 months) as summarized in Table 1. Some were enrolled in an intensive English-language program, taking English-as-a-second-language courses for academic
purposes, while others were in undergraduate or graduate degree programs of various majors,
all using English for academic and professional purposes every day in the U.S. Consequently,
participants in this study showed mixed English language proficiency. The L2 learners were
therefore divided into three proficiency groups, after removing those who scored zeros on
most of the task items. The proficiency groups were formed on the basis of participants'
performance ratings on a speaking task and a writing task, as described below.

Target Linguistic Structures
Target structures of this study were English headed RCs, headless RCs, and embedded whquestions attached to the object of a matrix verb. Each sentence contained a lexically-headed
relative, a headless relative, or an embedded wh-question, with two lexical NPs, having a
subject or direct object gap. The number of words in each sentence and the number of syllables
in each word and sentence were controlled, respectively, throughout the different items in
each test measure, as well as across the test measures. Ungrammatical stimuli items contained
either a resumption error or an inversion error. Sample sentences are given in Table 2.

Materials and Procedures
After providing informed consent, participants completed a language background questionnaire and then experimental tasks in the following order: (1) an elicited imitation task; (2) a
timed grammaticality judgment task; and (3) general proficiency measures. The two tasks,
elicited imitation and grammaticality judgment, were used to tap into distinct aspects of the
learners knowledge on the target structures: Elicited imitation, which is reconstructive in
nature, was predicted to elicit implicit linguistic knowledge with emphasis on meaning while
the grammaticality judgment task was expected to tap into learners' implicit knowledge on
the target forms over meanings (Ellis 2005; Erlam 2006). The tasks were implemented individually in a quiet room on a university campus. Below are descriptions of each task and its
procedure.
Language Background Questionnaire The language background questionnaire contained
questions about participants' language background, the age at which they started to learn
English, the amount of time they had spent in English-speaking countries, the kind of Englishlanguage instruction they had received, and any other languages they had learned.

Elicited Imitation Task Following Erlam's (2006) paradigm, participants were asked to say
out loud whether they would agree or disagree with the meaning of a statement by saying out
loud "yes," "no," or "I don't know." Immediately after making this judgment, they repeated
the sentence in correct English. Prior to the actual task, each participant received pre-recorded
training to become familiar with the procedures of the task. The practice session contained
eight statements in total, four grammatical and four ungrammatical. The elicited imitation
task consisted of 30 sentences, 24 items of which contained the target structures under
investigation. The rest of the statements addressed tense/aspect, and number agreement, as
a way to distract learner attention from the target structures. Each sentence used in the task
contained eight to sixteen syllables in six to ten words. The target structures, English headed
relatives, headless relatives, and embedded wh-questions, were placed at the end of each
sentence, functioning as a direct object of the main verb. There were two grammatical and
two ungrammatical sentences per target structure.
The thirty sentences were read and audio-recorded by a female native speaker of English.
Shorter sentences came first, and longer sentences were presented later in the testing session
(Erlam 2006). Each sentence was played once for each participant. Participants' responses
were audio-recorded using the computer software Audacity. Responses during the elicited
imitation task were scored following Diessel and Tomasello (2005). A response was scored 1
if a learner showed exact repetition, sometimes after self-correction. Learner responses with
changes (tense, aspect, modality and negation) that did not drastically alter the meaning of
the test sentence were still coded as correct. A 0.5 was given for responses with a minor
deviation from the test sentence, such as lexical substitutions (e.g., artistic for autistic, psychologists for counselors, use of they for a plural noun), lexical omissions (e.g., `kids' for
`autistic kids'), omissions of adverbs, adjectives, or determiners. A score of 0 was assigned
if the target structure of the test sentence was altered, or if the learner produced an ungrammatical repetition. The data for each sentence type were converted to percentages of correct
responses.
Grammaticality Judgment Task The grammaticality judgment task was composed of 48
sentences that were evenly divided between grammatical and ungrammatical. 24 test items
(two pairs of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences for each target structure) and 24
distracters were used for the task. The sentences were presented on a computer screen in
randomized order using E-Prime (version 2). The participants were instructed to judge the
grammaticality of each sentence and press a "1" key for grammatical or a "2" key for ungrammatical on a joystick as fast as they could. The time limit for each sentence was 20 seconds,
and every participant was able to answer all of the questions on the task. A percentage
accuracy score was calculated for each participant for each of the target structures.

Proficiency Measures To determine participants' general proficiency level in English, their
production in L2 speaking and writing was elicited. Both the speaking and writing tasks
contained six authentic items pertaining to various situations that undergraduate/graduate
students were likely to encounter, regardless of academic program. To respect confidentiality, participants were told that they did not have to reveal any personal details during the
completion of the tasks, but instead could make up details as they wished. Responses to the
speaking component were audio-recorded and transcribed, and responses to the writing task
were recorded in a paper-based format. A 7-point scale was used for each rating in both
speaking and writing, where higher scores indicated higher quality speech. The reliability
of the measures was acceptable as indexed by Cronbach's alpha values (speaking = 0.87;
writing = 0.89).
The researchers rated the learners' responses during the completion of the speaking and
writing tasks, following the criteria from MacIntyre et al. (1997). The speech samples were
rated in terms of the number of ideas expressed and the quality of the English. The rating criteria for output quality entailed fluency (flowing speech without pauses), sentence complexity
(use of complex sentences rather than fragmented phrases), accented speech (the extent to
which the learner sounded like an English native speaker), elaboration (amount of detail),
grammar, and proximity to American English colloquial expressions. The writing responses
were scored on the basis of the number of ideas expressed and output quality. Criteria for
output quality included grammaticality, sentence complexity, degree of elaboration, and similarity to a native speaker of American English. The aggregate ratings of the aforementioned
criteria for output quality in speaking and writing were used for analysis. Fifty percent of
the spoken data were rated by an English-native-speaking research assistant after a training
session with the researchers, and there was 85 % agreement for speaking and 90 % for writing
between the raters. Even when the raters were not in complete agreement, the difference was
never by more than 1 point on the 7-point scale, and the average score between the raters was
used for analysis.
The group average and standard deviation of the individual sums of scores were calculated
to divide the sixty-four participants into three groups. Group 1 (N = 21) consisted of those
who scored more than a standard deviation below the average, Group 2 (N = 21) scored
within the range of a standard deviation below and above the average, and Group 3 (N = 22)
scored more than a standard deviation above the average.

Results
Results of the elicited imitation task and the grammaticality judgment task, completed by
64 adult learners of L1 Korean L2 English of three different levels of English proficiency,
and by twenty native speakers of English, were analyzed. Table 3 shows the means and
standard deviations of percentage scores that the L2 learners and native speakers obtained on
the elicited imitation task and the grammaticality judgment task. Overall, the native speakers
demonstrated scores exceeding the scores of the L2 learners across all the different proficiency
levels, with less variation on the measure. It was noted that the grammaticality judgment task
performance of Group 3, which had the highest proficiency level, was similar to that of the
native speakers, particularly with respect to the headless relative construction.
To answer the research questions with respect to subject-object asymmetry and the developmental order of the three wh-extracted structures, a three-way mixed analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted, with the target structure (headed RCs, headless RCs, and embed-

for the headed RC, headless RC, and embedded wh-questions in terms of the subject-object-gap distinction

ded wh-questions) and the gap position (subject and direct object) as within-participants
variables, and with proficiency level (Groups 1, 2, and 3) as a between-participants variable, for the results of the elicited imitation task and the grammaticality judgment task. The
percentage of correct responses on the elicited imitation task and the grammaticality judgment task for the target structures across different proficiency levels in Fig. 1 illustrate the
three-way interaction.
Results of the elicited imitation task showed a significant main effect of the linguistic
structure, F(2, 122) = 117.64, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.66. Simple effect analyses revealed that
the L2 learners showed better performance with headless RCs than they did with headed RCs,
F(1, 61) = 194.68, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.76, or with embedded wh-questions, F(1, 61) =
47.24, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.44, and that the L2 learners were more successful with embedded
wh-questions than they were with headed RCs, F(1, 61) = 84.80, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.58.
The main effect of the gap position was significant, F(1, 61) = 11.30, p < 0.05, 2p = 0.16,
which indicates a significant difference between subject versus direct object positions as the
site of extraction across the target structures. The main effect of proficiency level was also

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2016) 45:1389-1406

1401

significant, F(2, 61) = 92.00, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.75, suggesting that the elicited imitation
task was able to differentiate among the three levels of English proficiency for the learners
in this study.
There was a significant interaction between the linguistic structure and the gap position,
F(2, 122) = 12.82, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.17, suggesting that the L2 learners' performance
in terms of the target linguistic structures differed between the subject gap and the direct
object gap. To examine the interaction further, simple effect analyses were conducted, comparing headed RCs and headless RCs to embedded wh-questions. Those results revealed
significant interactions when comparing the subject-object gaps between headed RCs and
headless RC, F(1, 61) = 5.79, p < 0.05, 2p = 0.08, between headed RCs and embedded
questions, F(1, 61) = 5.961, p < 0.05, 2p = 0.09, and between headless RCs and embedded questions, F(1, 61) = 31.34, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.34. This indicates a subject-object
asymmetry across the target structures. No significant interaction was observed between the
linguistic structure and proficiency level on the elicited imitation task,F(4, 122) = 1.88, p <
0.05, 2p = 0.06. This indicates that the L2 learners' performance pertaining to the target
structures was similar across the three levels of English proficiency. The interaction between
the gap position and proficiency level, F(2, 61) = 0.25, p = 0.78, 2p = 0.01, was not
significant, which suggests the learners' treatment of the gap position in the target structures
was not significantly different across the different proficiency levels.
The elicited imitation task results showed a significant three-way interaction among the
linguistic structure, gap position, and proficiency level, F(4, 122) = 2.47, p < 0.05, 2p =
0.08. This suggests that the level of interaction between the linguistic structure and the gap
was different across the three groups of L2 learners with different proficiency levels. Simple
effect analyses were used to break down this three-way interaction. The first simple effect
analysis revealed a significant interaction when the learners' imitation of the headed RCs
was compared to that of the embedded wh-questions across the proficiency levels when the
learners produced a structure with a subject gap compared to a structure with a direct object
gap, F(2, 61) = 4.52, p < 0.05, 2p = 0.13. However, no significant differences were
observed across the proficiency levels when the learners' imitation of the headless RCs was
compared to that of the headed RCs, F(2, 61) = 0.69, p = 0.51, 2p = 0.02, or to that of the
embedded questions, F(2, 61) = 2.19, p = 0.12, 2p = 0.07, when the learners produced a
structure with a subject extracted, compared to a structure with a direct object extracted.
To follow up with the three-way interaction, three two-way ANOVAs were conducted
for each proficiency group. The three ANOVAs revealed significant main effects for the
linguistic structure [Group 1, F(2, 40) = 52.64, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.73; Group 2, F(2, 40) =
55.37, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.74; Group 3, F(2, 42) = 26.34, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.56]. Simple
effect analyses showed that the learners across the different proficiency levels showed better
performance with headless RCs than they did with headed RCs [Group 1, p < 0.001, Group
2, p < 0.001, Group 3, p < 0.001] or embedded wh-questions [Group 1, p < 0.001,
Group 2, p < 0.05, Group 3, p < 0.001] and that the L2 learners were more successful
with embedded questions than they were with headed RCs [Group 1, p < 0.001, Group 2,
p < 0.001, Group 3, p < 0.001]. The main effects for the gap position were significant
for Group 1, F(1, 20) = 5.99, p < 0.05, 2p = 0.23 and Group 3, F(2, 21) = 11.19, p <
0.05, 2p = 0.35, but Group 2 showed a non-significant main effect for the gap position,
F(1, 20) = 1.04, p = 0.32, 2p = 0.05. The interaction between the structure and the gap
position was significant for Group 1, F(2, 40) = 52.64, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.02 and for Group
2, F(2, 40) = 11.26, p < 0.001, 2p = 0.36, but not for Group 3, F(2, 42) = 2.40, p <

0.05, 2p = 0.10. This suggests that the learners with lower proficiency levels in the L2 tended
to show a greater subject-object asymmetry for the target wh-extracted structures than the
advanced learners did.
Results of the grammaticality judgment task, on the other hand, yielded no statistically
significant effects, except for the significant main effect of proficiency level, F(2, 61) =
5.08, p < .05, 2p = 0.14, suggesting that the grammaticality judgment task was able to
differentiate between the three levels of English proficiency for the learners. Although not
statistically significant, a trend similar to the results of the elicited imitation task was observed
in the results of the grammaticality judgment task, as shown in Fig. 1. A difference between
the subject versus direct object positions as the site of extraction across the target structures
was detected. In the headed relatives and headless relatives, the L2 learners demonstrated
higher scores with a subject gap than with a direct object gap. In the embedded wh-questions,
on the other hand, the L2 learners showed better performance with a direct object gap than
they did with a subject gap.

Discussion
Results of this study revealed that subject-object asymmetry (i.e., a subject advantage), which
has been observed in L2 acquisition of lexically headed RCs, is also found in L2 acquisition
of headless RCs by L1 Korean L2 English adults. The structural distance hypothesis, drawing
on the distance between a filler and a gap (O'Grady 1997; Wolfe-Quintero 1992), was supported in the domain of headless relative. Rather than interpreting embedded RC sentences
as conjoined sentences, as proposed by the conjoined-clause analysis (Tavakolian 1981), the
adult L2 learners rely on the distance between the filler and gap as a cue for processing and
analyzing a headless relative, as well as a headed relative.
In contrast to the subject advantage found in the headed relatives and headless relatives, a
backward asymmetry (i.e., an object advantage) was observed in the L2 acquisition of embedded wh-questions. This finding suggests that the L2 learners might have treated the embedded
wh-questions differently from the headed RCs and headless RCs. This is inconsistent with
Wolfe-Quintero's (1992) proposal with respect to the implicational order of acquisition in
RCs and wh-questions in adult L2 acquisition. She noted that cumulative sequences of L2
development would apply "equally" to RCs and wh-questions, in that both RCs and whquestions require learners to extract a noun appropriately to prevent a gap. If the depth of
embedding serves as a criterion for L2 acquisition, as predicted by Wolfe-Quintero (1992),
then the Korean-speaking learners of L2 English should have shown a subject advantage in
the L2 acquisition of embedded wh-questions, as well as in the acquisition of headed RCs and
headless RCs. Across the three target structures, the level of embeddedness for the object gap
was deeper than that for the subject gap. The findings reported here, however, suggest that
L2 learners instead treat embedded wh-questions differently from headed RCs and headless
RCs.
The backward asymmetry found in the embedded wh-questions, in contrast to the subjectobject asymmetry in the headed RCs and headless RCs, lends support to a structure-based
account proposed by Stromswold (1995) that learners demonstrate different developmental
routes for different grammatical structures in the target language. Of particular relevance
to the current study is her account for the development of wh-questions with an object
gap prior to wh-questions with a subject gap in L1 English-speaking children's naturalistic
production. She attributed the developmental sequence to the difference in the underlying

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2016) 45:1389-1406

1403

properties of the grammatical structures. Drawing on Lasnik and Saito's (1984) proposal
that the government of traces can be accomplished through theta-government or antecedentgovernment, it was argued that complement traces (object traces) and non-complement traces
(subject and adjunct traces) are governed in different ways, and that the government of subject
traces is less local and less direct than the government of object traces. Therefore, the L2
learners would find it less difficult to process the representation of embedded wh-questions
with object gaps than of embedded wh-questions with subject gaps.
In addition to structural differences between the relative clauses and the embedded whquestions in the target language, English, an L1 transfer effect also might have come into
play. As noted in the literature review, earlier work on the L1 acquisition of Korean (Clancy
1989) reported that wh-questions (with lexical verbs) with object gaps occur before those with
subject gaps in Korean children's naturalistic production. The backward asymmetry pattern
in the acquisition of wh-questions in Korean is consistent with that in English, as reported by
Stromswold (1995). The Korean-speaking learners of L2 English, who might have treated
English embedded wh-questions different from relative clauses, would have carried over the
backward asymmetry feature in wh-questions from their L1 to the L2. The occurrence of
wh-questions with object gaps no later than those with subject gaps in the acquisition of L1
Korean offers another explanation for the current findings on the backward asymmetry in L2
acquisition of English embedded wh-questions by Korean speakers.
Turning to the developmental findings across the headed RCs, headless RCs, and embedded wh-questions, this study uncovered three developmental patterns: (1) headless RCs
before headed RCs; (2) headless RCs before embedded wh-questions; and (3) embedded
wh-questions before headed RCs. The first developmental pattern observed in this study, the
acquisition of headless RCs followed by that of lexically headed RCs, is aligned with what
has been reported in the acquisition literature. A series of experimental studies have reported
headless RCs serving as a developmental precursor to lexically headed RCs in the acquisition
of L1 English (Flynn and Lust 1980), and in the acquisition of L2 English by speakers of
languages with a different word order within the RC from that of English, such as Japanese
and German (Berkes and Flynn 2012a, b). Previous findings on the acquisition of L1 Korean
provide evidence in support of the precedence of headless RCs over headed RCs. Kim (1987:
346) observed in her longitudinal data of the spontaneous speech of three Korean children
that the earliest forms of the RC were headless structures (e.g., Mary-ka sa-n ke, "what Mary
bought"). The children later produced a juxtaposition of ke(s) ("a thing") and a lexical head
noun (e.g., pay tha-nun ke salam, "the person, the one who is riding a boat") prior to their
production of head-external RCs. In a study with the natural speech data of 36 children whose
ages ranged from 16 to 45 months, Lee (1991) found a similar developmental pattern. Results
of the current study on the L1 Korean L2 English learners' better performance with headless
RCs than with lexically headed RCs lends support to the cross-linguistic observation that
headless RCs, perceived as a complex nominal phrases rather than as embedded clauses, are
acquired earlier than headed RCs.
The second pattern, the acquisition of headless RCs prior to embedded wh-questions, is
consistent with a linguistic account for the disparities between headless RCs and embedded
wh-questions despite the similarity in surface form between the two structures. Previous studies (Caponigro and Pearl 2009; Ott 2011; Riemsdijk, 2006) pointed out that while embedded
questions have a clause type, selected by the matrix verb and attracting the wh-element, headless relatives tend to have the distribution of a nominal, and the wh-phrase does not match
selection requirements of the matrix predicate. Results of the current study on the relative ease
of headless RCs over embedded wh-questions in L2 acquisition provide supporting evidence
for the analysis of headless RCs as a complex nominal phrase, as opposed to a clause.

The relative difficulty of lexically headed RCs is found not only in the developmental
order between the two types of RCs, headed and headless relatives, but also in the observation
that L2 learners showed better performance with the embedded wh-questions than they did
with headed RCs. The relative difficulty of lexically headed RCs can be accounted for by a
structure-based account, which is aligned with the structure-based approach to the disparity
in acquisition of the gap position between headed RCs and headless RCs, on the one hand,
and embedded wh-questions, on the other. Headless RCs, headed RCs, and embedded whquestions all involve movement of a relative pronoun or an interrogative pronoun to the left
periphery of the embedded clause (i.e., spec-CP). What sets headed RCs apart from the other
two structures is that there is an additional step, i.e., relating a relative pronoun in the left
periphery of the embedded clause to the relative head by way of co-reference (Friedmann and
Novogrodsky 2004). Results of the current study suggest that this additional step required for
the acquisition of headed RCs might present a challenge to L1 Korean L2 English learners.

Conclusions
This study examined the subject-object asymmetry and developmental sequence in L2 acquisition of three types of extraction, i.e., English headed RCs, headless RCs, and embedded
wh-questions, by adult speakers of L1 Korean in which the target structures are less similar to
one another than they are in English. Sixty-nine learners of L1 Korean and L2 English completed an elicited imitation task and a grammaticality judgment task. The results revealed
a subject advantage in the headed RCs and headless RCs, but an object advantage in the
embedded wh-questions. The finding about the subject advantage in the domains of headed
RCs and headless RCs suggests that the L2 learners rely on the structural distance between a
filler and a gap as a cue, rather than interpreting the RC sentences as if they were conjoined.
The object advantage found in the acquisition of embedded wh-questions indicates that the L2
learners might have treated the embedded wh-questions differently from headed relatives and
headless relatives despite the similarities in their surface forms. The results further suggested
a developmental order of acquisition: headless RCs, followed by embedded wh-questions,
and subsequently headed RCs.
Findings from this study are a notable contribution to L2 research. The study is one of
the few empirical attempts to examine the representation of L2 knowledge with respect to
different wh-extraction structures (English lexically headed relatives, headless relatives, and
embedded wh-questions) as a function of L2 proficiency level. While issues concerning the
developmental patterns of lexically headed RCs have been widely addressed in the literature,
this study brings the different wh-extraction structures together and directly tests their relational status to each other in L2 development for learners at different developmental stages.
The current study further attempted to apply the well-established findings on the developmental patterns of headed relatives to the L2 acquisition of less-studied headless relatives
and embedded wh-questions.
Despite its significant merits, this study may have some potential limits which lead to
suggestions for future research. The elicited imitation task and grammaticality judgment
task employed in the study was narrowly targeted at the structural representations of the
wh-extraction structures at different developmental stages. The tasks can therefore tell us
little about the L2 learners' processing or semantic interpretation of these structures. Little
information is available what processing strategies they used during the completion of the
elicited imitation task and which element(s) they spent more time on while reading each

sentence on the computer screen in completing the grammaticality judgment task. The tasks
cannot provide any fine-grained information as to any disparity or lack thereof in meaning
comprehension across the target structures. In addition, no measure was taken to control
the semantic categories of verbs (e.g., mental versus physical verbs) used in the task items,
which might have potentially led to different results. Taken together, there is a need for future
research to investigate the online processing and semantic interpretation of these structures
with semantically-controlled verbs as a function of L2 proficiency levels in order to obtain a
fuller picture of L2 development pertaining to English wh-extraction structures.
