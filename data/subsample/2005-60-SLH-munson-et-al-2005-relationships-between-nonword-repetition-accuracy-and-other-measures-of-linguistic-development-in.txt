A growing body of research has documented effects of phonotactic probability on
young children's nonword repetition. This study extends this research in 2 ways.
First, it compares nonword repetitions by 40 young children with phonological
disorders with those by 40 same-age peers with typical phonological development on a nonword repetition task in which the frequency of embedded diphone
sequences was varied. Second, it examines the relationship between the frequency effect in the nonword repetition task and other measures of linguistic
ability in these children. Children in both groups repeated low-frequency
sequences less accurately than high-frequency sequences. The children with
phonological disorders were less accurate overall but showed no larger disadvantage for the low-frequency sequences than their age peers. Across the group, the
size of the frequency effect was correlated with vocabulary size, but it was
independent of measures of speech perception and articulatory ability. These
results support the hypothesis that the production difficulty associated with lowfrequency sequences is related primarily to vocabulary growth rather than to
developments in articulatory or perceptual ability. By contrast, production
problems experienced by children with phonological disorders do not appear to
result from difficulties in making abstractions over known lexical items. Instead,
they may be associated with difficulties in building representations in the primary
sensory and motor domains.

A

number of recent studies have examined the influence of the
likelihood of occurrence of phoneme sequences (phonotactic probability) on the processing and production of nonsense words.
These studies have found that nonwords containing sequences of phonemes attested in many words (high-probability nonwords) are processed
and produced differently from those containing sequences of phonemes
attested in few or no words (low-probability nonwords). Phonotactic probability has been found to affect repetition latency, accuracy, and duration; novel-word learning; ratings of wordlikeness; and both immediate

and long-term memory (e.g., Frisch, Large, & Pisoni,
2000; Munson, 2001; Storkel, 2001; Vitevitch & Luce,
1999). The effects of phonotactic probability have been
found to change throughout development. For example,
the effect of phonotactic probability on segment durations and repetition accuracy declines with age (Munson,
2001). These findings prompted us to explore how and
why the effects of phonotactic probability change during the course of phonological development.
Edwards, Beckman, and Munson (2004) examined
the influence of phonotactic probability on nonword repetition accuracy in typically developing (TD) children
age 3 to 8 and in adults. Edwards et al. replicated
Munson's finding that the difference in repetition accuracy between high- and low-frequency sequences of phonemes declines with age. Moreover, they showed that
this decline was correlated more strongly with vocabulary growth than with age. That is, there was an interaction between the magnitude of the difference in repetition accuracy between high- and low-frequency
sequences (which Edwards et al. termed the frequency
effect) and vocabulary size: The frequency effect was
smaller in children with larger vocabularies, even when
the effects of age were controlled. These results suggest
a model in which children's representation and productive control of sublexical fragments are related to their
vocabulary growth. In such a model, phonemes--that
is, representations of each of the consonant and vowel
categories of the language robustly abstracted away from
the acoustic-auditory and articulatory representations
of the words in which they appear--are presumed to
develop gradually throughout childhood.
Nonword repetition is a task that can be used to
assess the robustness of these abstractions. In nonword
repetition, the speaker must assemble production plans
for individual phonemes into a larger unfamiliar sequence. This may be more difficult when the nonwords
contain infrequent sequences of phonemes because children cannot bootstrap from information in known lexical items. Edwards et al. (2004) hypothesized that young
children with smaller vocabularies repeated nonwords
less accurately when they contained sequences that were
not attested in the lexicons because they did not have
access to robustly abstracted phonemic representations
that they could combine into novel sequences. Older
children with larger vocabularies showed a smaller effect because their representational systems had grown
to include robust representations of phonemes separate
from the lexical items in which they occur. This interpretation is consistent with a variety of other recent investigations, which have converged on the notion that
early phonological representations are relatively holistic and that lexical growth influences the ability to segment words into phonemes and to produce and process
these phonemes independently of the words in which
62

they occur (Edwards et al., 2004; Metsala, 1999; Storkel,
2002). These phonemic representations are categorical
units that link to the more primary acoustic and articulatory representations of whole word-shapes that children accrue by producing and perceiving words. These
phonemic categories supplement children's knowledge
of the complex relationship between articulatory movements and their acoustic consequences (i.e., the forward
model described by Bailley, Laboissiere, & Schwartz,
1991; Jordan, 1990) that have already begun to develop
in infancy during babbling.
The creation of autonomous phonemic categories
would facilitate subsequent word learning, as suggested
by Lindblom (1992), Beckman and Edwards (2000), and
Fisher, Hunt, Chambers, and Church (2001), among others. Such categories would allow for a fast mapping of
the phonological structure of a new word. This mapping
can be considered analogous to the fast mapping of novel
words that has been studied by Dollaghan (1987). That
is, the fast mapping that these categories afford would
allow the language learner to make an automatic association between an immediate acoustic representation
of a newly encountered word and the articulatory movements required to produce the same acoustic output. It
could be that the increase in repetition accuracy noted
by Edwards et al. (2004) reflects the influence of the
development of categorical phonemic representations:
Individuals with larger vocabularies repeat low-frequency sequences of phonemes more accurately because
they can more easily parse nonwords into their constituent phonemes and recombine the associated articulatory representations into novel vocal motor schemes (constellations of articulatory gestures analogous to those
discussed by McCune & Vihman, 1987, in younger children) for fluent speech production.
This view of normal phonological acquisition can
potentially inform our understanding of the causes of
phonological disorders (PD) in children. Children with
PD demonstrate a variety of speech-production errors
in the absence of an obvious medical etiology. Within
this model of the relationship between phonological development and vocabulary growth, children with PD
might have difficulty with building categorical phonemic representations that link lexical, articulatory, and
acoustic representations to each other. That is, the delayed articulatory development of these children may
be due to their not having access to the abstract representations needed both to parse newly encountered
words into phonemelike units during word learning and
to make correct associations to the speech movements
required to accurately reproduce these newly learned
words. As a consequence of this inability, children with
PD may develop more poorly specified phonological representations of words. Although the specific errors that
would result from these poorly specified representations

are not the focus of this investigation, this account predicts that these children might default to the auditory
and perceptual patterns that are well established in representations of other words, to patterns that are
articulatorily easy, and/or to patterns that afford the
most perceptual distance between words in the productive vocabulary. Over time, these error patterns would
become gradually more entrenched and might give the
impression that a child has developed a systematic rule
or constraint that operates uniformly over his or her
lexicon. If so, the difficulty of children with PD might be
similar to the difficulties encountered by the children
with small vocabularies in Edwards et al. (2004). That
is, the children with PD might show greater differences
in repetition accuracy between high- and low-frequency
nonwords because of their poorly developed categorical
phonemic representations. This view differs fundamentally from accounts of children's sound-production errors as resulting from higher level phonological rules or
constraints that are specified in a module of the grammar separate from the lexicon, which are possibly innate and universal (e.g., Barlow & Dinnsen, 1998;
Barlow & Gierut, 1999; Bernhardt, 1994; Bernhardt &
Stoel-Gammon, 1996; Ingram, 1976; Shriberg &
Kwiatowski, 1994). However, it is similar to these accounts in that PD is seen as a deficit in higher level
representations instead of (or in addition to) difficulty
with the primary articulatory and auditory domains.
There is a second account of the relationship between vocabulary growth and the frequency effect that
was not considered by Edwards et al. (2004). The increase in repetition accuracy with vocabulary growth
observed by those investigators might simply reflect
more robust generalizations about the different sources
of variability in acoustic and/or articulatory representations. That is, the children with larger vocabularies
might have been more accurate in repeating the nonword
stimuli simply because their acoustic representations
of the component sound patterns are better developed
from having heard these patterns in many different real
words. Alternatively, their motor representations of the
articulatory gestures needed to produce the component
sound patterns might be better developed, from more
experience with producing them in many different real
words in different prosodic and sentential contexts; under different environmental conditions; and in the presence of different degrees of afferent feedback.
This second account of the developmental change
in the frequency effect also has implications for our
understanding of PD. Children with PD might simply
have difficulty in either or both of these primary representational domains, and these difficulties might be
either a proximal or distal cause of their phonological
disorders. That is, their deficits might be explained by
their difficulties in building peripheral perceptual and

articulatory representations. Such an account of PD
would be consistent with views in which PD stems from
deficits in articulatory-motor and/or acoustic-auditory
representations (e.g., Edwards, 1992; Edwards,
Fourakis, Beckman, & Fox, 1999; Forrest, Chin, Pisoni,
& Barlow, 1995; Gibbon, 1999; Towne, 1994).
The purpose of this article, then, is twofold. First, it
explores the alternative explanation for the frequency
effect that was not considered by Edwards et al. (2004).
This is done by examining interactions between performance on the nonword repetition task and measures of
speech perception and speech articulation, as well as
measures of vocabulary size. This comparison allows us
to determine the relative extent to which development
of more primary sensory representations, as distinct
from growth in vocabulary size, contributes to the frequency effect. Second, the article compares the performance of TD children with that of children with PD.
This comparison allows us to examine whether the deficits of children with PD can be related to difficulties in
building categorical phonemic representations that link
among acoustic, articulatory, and lexical representations
or whether they are due to deficits in building lower
level perceptual and motor representations.
Our specific experimental questions are as follows.
First, what independent measures predict the magnitude of the frequency effect in TD children and in children with PD? To address this question, we have examined regressions predicting the frequency effect from
measures of speech perception, phoneme-production
accuracy in real words, and vocabulary size. A finding
that the frequency effect is predicted equally well by all
three measures would argue against Edwards et al.'s
conclusion that its decrease during development is related to the influence of vocabulary growth on the development of categorical phonemic units. Instead, such
a result would suggest that developmental changes in
the frequency effect are related more broadly to the development of knowledge about the articulatory and
acoustic structure of words. A finding that only vocabulary-size measures predict this would strengthen
Edwards et al.'s claim.
Our second question was whether children with PD
demonstrate a larger effect of phoneme-sequence frequency than TD children matched for age. A finding that
children with PD demonstrate a larger frequency effect
would suggest that they have difficulty building an intermediate layer of phonemic representations that mediate among acoustic, articulatory, and lexical representations and that this difficulty might be causally related
to their disorder. Conversely, a finding that children with
PD differ only on measures of perceptual ability and
overall production accuracy in words and nonwords
would suggest that their difficulties in production are

not related to any problems with this intermediate layer
of phonemic representations.

Method
Participants
The participants were 40 children with PD, ranging in age from 3 to 6 years, and 40 same-age TD controls. All children were participating in a larger study
on the etiology of PD. The 40 children with TD were a
subset of the children who participated in the study described in Edwards et al. (2004). All of the participants,
both the children with PD and the children with TD,
met the following criteria: (a) normal hearing, as evidenced by passing a hearing screening at 20 dB at 500,
1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz (American National Standards
Institute, 1989); (b) normal nonverbal intelligence, as
evidenced by a standard score no more than 1 SD below
the mean on the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale
(CMMS; Burgemeister, Blum, & Lorge, 1972); and (c)
normal structure and function of the peripheral speech
mechanism, as evidenced by a standard score no more
than 1 SD below the mean on the Oral Movement subtest
of the Kaufman Speech Praxis Test for Children (KSPT;
Kaufman, 1995). Two children with PD had standard
scores below 85 on the KSPT but were still included in
the study because their low scores were not related to
problems with neuromotor control. One child received a
78, with errors related to a short lingual frenum, and
the other child received an 81, with errors related to his
refusal to touch his tongue to his lips because of severely
chapped lips. The two groups differed in KSPT scores.
This was true when the 2 outliers were included (PD M
= 98, TD M = 106), t(73) = 3.2, p < .01, and when they
were omitted (PD M = 101, TD M = 106), t(71) = 2.9, p
< .01. We are confident that this difference is not indicative of group differences in overall speech praxis,
given that all but 2 of the children scored within normal limits and that the scores for the 2 outliers were
due to exceptional circumstances. All of the children
with PD scored at or below the 10th percentile on the
Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation (GFTA, Goldman
& Fristoe, 1986), while all of the children with TD
scored at or above the 40th percentile on the GFTA and
were individually matched to the children with PD on
the basis of age (within 6 months), gender, and nonverbal IQ score on the CMMS (within 10 points--i.e.,
twice the standard error of measurement). In this study,
as in Edwards et al. (2004), we examined the relationship between the effect of sublexical sequence frequency
on accuracy and vocabulary size. We used the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test--III (PPVT-III; Dunn & Dunn,
1997) to estimate receptive vocabulary size, and we used
the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT; Williams, 1997)
64

to estimate expressive vocabulary size. These two tests
are conormed for participants age 2 through 90.
Table 1 gives descriptive information for the 40 children in each of the two groups. One-way analyses of
variance revealed significant group differences on GFTA
percentile rankings, F(1, 78) = 441.35, p < .001, 2 =
0.85. While all children with PD scored within normal
limits (no more than 1 SD below the mean) on both
measures of vocabulary size, there was also a small but
significant group difference on PPVT-III standard
scores, F(1, 78) = 7.54, p < .01, 2 = 0.08. Consequently,
PPVT-III scores were used as a covariate in all parametric analyses of group differences. There were no significant differences between the two groups on CMMS
or EVT standard scores.

Nonword Repetition
A detailed description of the stimuli for the
nonword repetition task, the procedure for data collection, and the methods used for transcribing the data
and for scoring segmental accuracy is provided in
Edwards et al. (2004). Briefly, the stimuli consisted of
22 two-syllable nonwords and 22 three-syllable
nonwords, presented in Table 2. One half of the
nonwords contained a high-probability diphone sequence, and one half contained a low-probability
diphone sequence. Each of the high-frequency diphone

sequences was matched to a phonetically similar lowfrequency sequence. For example, the high-frequency
sequence /ju/ was matched to the low-frequency sequence
/jaU/. The target sequences were created by combining
earlier-acquired sounds (Smit, Freilinger, Bernthal,
Hand, & Bird, 1990) to make up seven pairs of CV sequences, seven pairs of VC sequences, and eight pairs
of CC sequences. The sequences were embedded in larger
word shapes, with the same stress and syllable structure framing both target diphone sequences in each pair.

These frames were not identical in phonetic content, as
pilot work had shown that the use of identical frames
induced a practice effect. The transitional probability of
the frames was matched as closely as possible across
the two word lists. Previous research had shown that
wordlikeness is positively related to repetition accuracy
(Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1991). As discussed in Edwards et al. (2004), the wordlikeness of the
high- and low-probability stimuli used in this study was
not equivalent. However, the differences in wordlikeness
between the high- and low-probability stimuli were
small. Moreover, regression analyses presented in
Edwards et al. showed that the differences in wordlikeness between the two lists of stimuli were due to
small differences in the frequency of the phoneme combinations making up the nontarget portions of the
nonwords rather than to the large differences in frequency between the target diphone sequences.
Prerecorded production prompts were used in the
nonword repetition task. Three pseudorandomized lists
of the nonword stimuli were created. In each list, (a) the
two members of each nonword pair were separated by
at least two other stimuli, (b) all of the two-syllable
nonwords were presented before the three-syllable
nonwords, and (c) equal numbers of nonwords containing high-frequency sequences were presented before the
paired word containing a low-frequency sequence and
vice versa. These were played from the hard drive of a
laptop computer through external speakers. Participants
were instructed to repeat the nonwords as accurately
as possible. Children wore a head-mounted microphone
attached to a DAT recorder, and their repetitions were
recorded for later analysis.
Accuracy of nonword repetition was scored as in
Edwards et al. (2004). Each target sequence could receive a maximum of 6 points for segmental accuracy, or
3 points per component phoneme. Consonants received
1 point each for correct place, correct manner, and correct voicing, while vowels received 1 point each for correct front-back position, correct vowel height, and correct length (i.e., tense or lax for a monophthong target
and monophthong or diphthong for a diphthong target).
For example, a child's production of [sg] in [busgit] for
the target sequence [fk] in the nonword [bufkit] would
have been scored as 4 (2 points for correct manner and
voicing in the s-for-f substitution and 2 points for the
correct place and manner for the g-for-k substitution).
A single researcher transcribed all of the responses
of the children with PD and age controls. The recordings were transferred from the DAT to a digital file on a
PC, and the productions were transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet at the level of a careful, broad
phonemic transcription. The transcriber used a waveform editor, so that she could easily listen to each word

as many times as necessary. A second transcriber independently transcribed 15% of the data from the children with PD and the children with TD (two 3-year-olds,
two 4-year-olds, and two 5-year-olds from each group).
Phoneme-by-phoneme interrater reliability ranged from
87% to 92% for data from individual participants with
PD, with a mean of 89%. Interrater reliability for the
children with TD was 92%, with a range of 86% to 99%
for individual participants.

Speech Perception Ability
One of the goals of this project was to examine
whether accuracy of repetition of high- and low-frequency sequences was affected by speech perception
ability. The measure of speech perception ability in this
article comes from a speech perception task that all of
the children had completed as part of their participation in the larger study (Edwards, Fox, & Rogers, 2002).
In this task, they were asked to choose between two CVC
words that differed only in the identity of the final consonant, in both a gated condition (i.e., a condition in
which the burst or the burst and most of the VC formant
transition into the closure of the final consonant had
been removed) and a condition in which the entire word
was played. Due to technical problems, data were missing for 2 children with PD. In this experiment, children
listened to audio files of prerecorded, digitized stimuli
played from a computer. On each trial, children were
asked to identify which of two pictures the stimulus
named. Two different pairs of words were used, cap/cat
and tap/tack. The experiment was blocked by word pair;
the participants always made a two-alternative forcedchoice identification. For example, on a particular trial,
a child might hear a full or gated version of the word cat
and point to a picture of either a cat or a cap. Further
details about the administration of this task can be found
in Edwards et al. (2002).
The measure we chose from this experiment was
the d values from the ungated condition for the two
stimulus sets, averaged together. This served as a gross
indicator of the participants' ability to attend to fine phonetic detail in speech perception, because successful performance on this task requires children to attend to
subtle acoustic cues for final consonant place of articulation. Edwards et al. (2002) selected this measure for
use in their examination of the relationships among
speech perception, age, vocabulary size, and articulatory ability, because the TD participants in every age
group and the children with PD all performed above
chance only in the ungated condition. They had found
that this measure was correlated with both receptive
vocabulary size, as measured by PPVT-III raw score,
and with articulatory ability, as measured by GFTA raw
score.

Assessing Accuracy of
Individual Phoneme Segments
One additional goal of this project was to examine
whether accuracy for high- and low-frequency sequences
was related to children's phoneme-production accuracy
in real words. To examine this, we measured the number
of times each sound from the target diphone sequences
was produced correctly on a non-norm-referenced Phonetic Inventory (PI) test. The PI is a picture-naming task
that we developed to provide a more detailed probe of
articulation skills than the GFTA (Isermann, 2001). Like
the GFTA, the PI used colored line drawings of familiar
words to elicit single-word productions of each consonant of English in initial, medial, and final word positions. The PI provided a more in-depth assessment of a
child's articulation skills than the GFTA because it elicits each target consonant in three different words for
each target word position and because it also assesses
vowel production. Due to recording problems, data were
lost for 2 children with PD from the PI.
Each production of a target sound was scored as
correct or incorrect, and the number of correct productions was summed to get an accuracy rating for that
segment. Vowels were elicited in the stressed syllables
of three words, and the consonants /h/, /j/, and /w/ were
elicited in word-initial position in three words. Thus,
the maximum accuracy rating for each of these sounds
was 3, indicating that the child produced the sound correctly in all three target words. Nearly all of the other
consonants were elicited in three different positions (initial, medial, and final), yielding a maximum accuracy
rating of 9. The only exceptions were /T/, which was not
elicited in word-medial position, and /D/, which was not
elicited in word-final position. These sounds are very
infrequent in these positions, and it was difficult to find
picturable words to elicit them.
The researcher who had transcribed a subset of the
nonwords for the reliability analysis transcribed the
words elicited with the PI for all of the children, using
the same methodology as was used for the nonwords.
Another researcher (who was the primary transcriber
for the nonwords) then independently transcribed the
words elicited with the PI for a subset of the children
comprising two 3-year-olds, two 4-year-olds, and two
5-year-olds, with one child with PD and one child with
TD for each of these three age ranges. Phoneme-byphoneme interrater reliability ranged from 89% to 95%
(M = 92%).

Real-Word and Nonword Accuracy

accuracy scores for phonemes on the nonword repetition task were due to the phonotactic probabilities of
the high- and low-probability sequences or to more general difficulty producing the sounds that made up the
high- and low-frequency sequences. To make this assessment, we calculated total segmental accuracy
scores for the segments in the high- and low-frequency
target sequences on the nonword task, and we converted the accuracy rates for the same phonemes elicited as targets on the PI into weighted total scores.
That is, we summed (a) the segmental accuracy scores
for the phonemes in the two sequence types on the
nonword task and (b) the accuracy scores for the same
phonemes in real words, as elicited by the PI. Since we
expected vowels to be generally more accurate than consonants, we calculated separate totals for the consonants
and for the vowels, to make two sums for the segments
that were in the high-frequency target sequences and
two sums for the segments that were in the low-frequency target sequences.
For the nonword task, these four total segmental
accuracy scores (consonant and vowel scores in highand low-frequency nonwords) were simply the sums of
the accuracy scores for individual phonemes in each category. That is, the scores for the high-frequency
nonwords were simply the sum of the 3-point segmental accuracy scores for all of the consonants in the highfrequency diphone sequences.
As described above, 3 points was the highest segmental accuracy score that a target phoneme could receive on the nonword task. There were 14 vowels in the
high- and low-frequency sequences, so the maximum
possible score for the vowels was 42. There were 30 consonants in the high- and low-frequency sequences, so
the maximum possible score for the consonants was 90.
In the Results section, we refer to these as the nonword
accuracy sums.
To make comparable totals for the same phonemes
on the PI, we needed to weight the accuracy rates for
the target phonemes elicited in the real words by the
number of times each sound occurred in the target sequences in the nonword stimuli. To do this, we treated
the number of correct productions of the target phoneme
on the PI as an analogue to the 3-point segmental accuracy score on the nonword repetition task and multiplied this accuracy score by the number of times the
segment occurred in the relevant target sequence category in the nonword stimuli. For example, the consonant /f/ appears in three low-frequency target sequences
on the nonword repetition task in the stimuli /auftgA/,
/bufkit/, and /noefktu/. Therefore, we multiplied the PI
accuracy score for /f/ by 3 in calculating a child's total PI
accuracy for consonants in low-frequency sequences.
Similarly, the vowel /oe/ occurs in two high-frequency

target sequences in the stimuli /moebEp/ and /bedoeg/.
Therefore, we multiplied the PI accuracy score for /oe/
by 2 in calculating a child's total PI accuracy for vowels in high-frequency sequences. The consonants and
vowels making up the high- and low-frequency sequences are listed in Table 2. For example, the total
segmental accuracy score for consonants making up the
high-frequency diphone sequences would be calculated
as the segmental accuracy sum of /f/ multiplied by 2, /g/
multiplied by 4, /m/ multiplied by 3, /v/ multiplied by 2,
/j/, /n/ multiplied by 2, /k/ multiplied by 4, /p/ multiplied
by 3, /t/ multiplied by 6, /w/ multiplied by 2, and /d/.
As described above, the PI accuracy scores for vowels ranged from 0 to 3 because each vowel was elicited three times. The total possible PI accuracy score
for the vowels in each of the two sequence types therefore was 42, the same as for the total accuracy score
for the vowels in the nonword task. The consonant
types that were used in the 8 CC and 14 CV and VC
sequence pairs were /p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, f, v, j, w/. For
most of these consonants, the maximum number of
correct productions was 9, for the three elicitations of
each in word-initial, medial, and final position. The
two exceptions were /w/ and /j/, which occurred in several CV sequences in the nonword stimuli. These were
elicited only in word-initial position on the PI. We
multiplied the accuracy scores for these two consonant types by 3 before multiplying each consonant
type by the number of times it occurred in the target
sequences so that the accuracy scores for /w/ and /j/
would be weighted similarly to the accuracy scores
for all of the other consonant types. The highest possible PI accuracy score for consonants was thus 270:
9 (for the maximum adjusted PI score) * 30 (for the 30
consonants in the high- and low-frequency sequences).
In the Results section, we refer to these as the realword accuracy sums. These data were used for two
purposes. First, they were used in regression analyses in which we predicted children's accuracy in phoneme production in nonwords from their accuracy in
producing the same phonemes in real words. Second,
we used in them in analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs),
to determine whether there were group differences in
participants' accuracy in producing the sounds that
made up the high- and low-frequency diphone sequences. Table 3 summarizes the measures that we
used in our analyses, including the tasks from which
they were computed.

differences in the types of errors that the children produced. The second part uses a variety of regression analyses to examine predictors of each child's overall accuracy, as well as predictors of the difference in accuracy
between high- and low-frequency sequences for each
child's productions.

Analyses of Covariance
Mean nonword repetition accuracy. The first analysis examined group differences in mean accuracy scores
for the high- and low-frequency sequences in the
nonword repetition task, averaged across the 22 types.
Figure 1 contains mean accuracy scores for high- and
low-frequency sequences for the children with PD and
their TD peers. Since the two groups differed somewhat
in their PPVT-III standard scores, these were used as
covariates in this analysis. An a level of .05 was used to
determine significance for all analyses. A two-way (Frequency x Group) mixed-model ANCOVA revealed significant effects of frequency, F(1, 77) = 10.2, p < .01, 2 =
0.12, and group, F(1, 77) = 47.8, p < .01, 2 = 0.37. The
PPVT-III was a significant covariate, F(1, 77) = 9.5, p <
.01, 2 = 0.11. As expected, the PPVT-III interacted significantly with frequency, F(1, 77) = 5.0, p < .05, 2 =
0.06. This essentially replicated Edwards et al.'s (2004)
finding that vocabulary size differentially predicted
68

production accuracy of high- and low-frequency sequences. This interaction was explored further with
multiple regression analyses below. Finally, group and
frequency interacted significantly, F(1, 77) = 4.8, p < .05,
2 = 0.06. This interaction can be seen by comparing the
difference in bar heights in Figure 1.
Figure 1 shows that the TD children produced highfrequency sequences on average 0.49 points higher than
they produced low-frequency sequences. In contrast, the
difference in accuracy for the children with PD was a
somewhat smaller 0.35.
Mean accuracy in real words. The second set of
ANCOVAs examined whether there were group differences in accuracy of production of the consonants and
vowels in the high- and low-frequency sequences when
they occurred in real words on the PI. For this analysis,
the real-word accuracy sums were transformed to percentage correct scores. As is conventional with percentage scores, these were arcsine transformed before being
used in statistical analyses, to minimize error variance.
The arcsine-transformed scores were submitted to a twofactor mixed-model ANCOVA, with group (PD vs. TD)
as the between-subjects factor, frequency (phonemes
making up the high- vs. low-frequency sequences) as the
within-subjects factor, and PPVT-III as the covariate.
Vowels and consonants were examined separately.

with 93.0% accuracy; those used in creating the lowfrequency sequences were produced with 94.3% accuracy. There was a significant main effect of group, F(1,
73) = 14.5, p < .05, partial 2 = 0.17. Children with TD
produced vowels more accurately than children with PD
(TD M = 97.8%, PD M = 89.6%). Again, the PPVT-III
was not a significant covariate. None of the interactions
were significant, although slightly different patterns
were noted for the two groups: Children with TD produced vowels associated with the high-frequency sequences with 98.2% accuracy when these occurred in
real words and vowels associated with the low-frequency
sequences with 97.3% accuracy. In contrast, children
with PD produced vowels for high-frequency sequences
with 87.3% accuracy and vowels for low-frequency sequences with 91.3% accuracy.
The results from these ANCOVAs on accuracy of
phoneme production in real words suggested that the
observed differences between repetition accuracy for
high-probability sequences and low-probability sequences in nonwords were not due to their segmental
composition: When the same sounds were assessed in
real-word productions, accuracy did not differ between
the two sets. Relationships between real-word accuracy
and accuracy in nonwords are explored further with regression analyses below.

When consonants were examined, there was no significant main effect of frequency, F(1, 73) = 2.7, p > .05.
Across the two groups, the consonants that were used
to create the high-frequency and low-frequency sequences
were produced with approximately equal accuracy when
occurring in real words (high-frequency M = 85.2%, lowfrequency M = 83.7%). Unremarkably, the main effect of
group was significant, F(1, 73) = 30.4 , p < .01, partial 2
= 0.29. Across the two sequence types, children with PD
produced these consonant sounds with 75.5% accuracy;
children with TD produced them with 94.4% accuracy.
The PPVT-III was not a significant covariate, F(1, 73) =
2.9, p > .05. Although the PD children showed a slightly
larger difference than the TD children in production accuracy for the sounds used in creating the high- and lowfrequency sequences, this interaction did not achieve statistical significance (high-frequency M = 76.2%,
low-frequency M = 74.8%, for children with PD; highfrequency M = 94.3%, low-frequency M = 94.6%, for children with TD).
When vowel-production accuracy was examined,
there was no significant main effect of frequency, F(1,
73) = 1.2, p > .05. The vowels used in creating the highfrequency sequences were produced in the real words

Low-frequency versus zero-frequency sequences. One
factor complicating the interpretation of the frequency
effect in nonword repetition is that the low-frequency
sequences in this study included some nonoccurring sequences (e.g., /aUk/, which does not occur in any words
in the databases used to create the stimuli) as well as
some sequences that occur in a small number of real
words (e.g., /gaU/, which occurs in the word nightgown).
It is possible that the children with TD repeated lowfrequency sequences more accurately than the children
with PD because they knew more words and therefore
might have had more prior experience with saying the
attested low-frequency sequences. If this were the case,
we would predict that there would be larger group differences on the low-frequency sequences than on the zerofrequency sequences. Alternatively, it is possible that the
children with TD were more accurate because they had
more robustly abstracted representations of individual
phonemes to use in creating completely novel production
routines. If that were the case, then we might expect there
to be larger differences on the zero-frequency sequences.
To examine whether either of these two possibilities was
supported by this data set, we conducted two additional
ANCOVAs examining the differences between these two
sequence types. The first ANCOVA examined the difference in accuracy between the low-frequency but attested
sequences and their matched high-frequency sequences;
the second examined accuracy differences between zerofrequency sequences and their matched high-frequency

counterparts. Note that the high-frequency sequences
in these two analyses were different, as these ANCOVAs
examined matched pairs of high- and low- or zero-frequency sequences. This was a post hoc analysis; the original stimulus set was not designed to examine these differences. Thus, the stimuli were not counterbalanced
for whether they were attested in a few words or completely unattested. Nine of the 22 low-frequency sequences were attested in between one and six words in
the Hoosier mental lexicon (Pisoni, Nusbaum, Luce, &
Slowiaczek, 1985). Four of these nine sequences were
used in both two- and three-syllable nonwords. This resulted in 13 nonwords containing low-frequency sequences and 9 nonwords containing zero-frequency sequences.
The first ANCOVA examined the difference in accuracy between the attested low-frequency sequences and
their matched high-frequency counterparts. The withinsubjects factor was frequency, and the between-subjects
factor was group. The covariate was PPVT-III standard
score. Significant main effects were found for group, F(1,
77) = 30.6, p < .01, partial 2 = 0.28, and frequency, F(1,
77) = 10.7, p < .01, partial 2 = 0.12. Moreover, the PPVT-
III was a significant covariate, F(1, 77) = 12.8 p < .01,

partial 2 = 0.14. As in the earlier analysis, the PPVT-
III interacted with frequency, F(1, 77) = 7.5, p < .01,
partial 2 = 0.09. However, a significant interaction between group and frequency was not found. The performance of the two groups on the low-frequency sequences
is shown in Figure 2.
The second ANCOVA examined differences in accuracy between the zero-frequency sequences and their
matched high-frequency counterparts. Again, the withinsubjects factor was frequency, and the between-subjects
factor was group. The covariate was PPVT-III standard
score. Significant main effects were found for group, F(1,
77) = 42.1, p < .01, partial 2 = 0.35, and frequency, F(1,
77) = 3.8, p < .05, partial 2 = 0.05. Moreover, the PPVT-
III was a significant covariate, F(1, 77) = 5.7 p < .01,
partial 2 = 0.07. Unlike in the earlier analyses, the
PPVT-III did not interact with frequency. A significant
interaction between group and frequency was not found.
The performance of the two groups on the zero-frequency
sequences is shown in Figure 2.
Group differences in accuracy were found for both
sequence types. Thus, it seems unlikely that they were
due simply to group differences in familiarity with the
attested low-frequency sequences. In neither case was

there a Group x Frequency interaction. However, inspection of Figure 2 suggests that there was a larger difference in accuracy between the zero-frequency sequences
and their matched high-frequency counterparts than
between the attested low-frequency sequences and their
matched high-frequency counterparts. This is not surprising, as it indicates that participants in both groups
experienced greater difficulty generalizing correct production of phonemes to completely novel sequences than
to sequences that were represented in the lexicon, albeit with few examples.

Regression Analyses
The second set of analyses used a variety of regression analyses to examine predictors of overall accuracy
of nonword repetition and of the frequency effect. Tables
4, 5, and 6 contain simple correlations (Pearson's product-moment correlations) between various predictor
measures and various measures of each participant's performance on the nonword repetition task, first for the
entire group of participants, then for the TD children only,
and then for the PD children only. Inspection of these
tables suggests that each participant's mean repetition
accuracy was well predicted by a variety of variables, for
both the low-frequency and the high-frequency sequences.
However, the only consistent predictors of the frequency
effect were measures of vocabulary size.
Sequence frequency and accuracy in real words. The
first regression analysis was intended to assess articulatory difficulty or general articulatory ability as a

potential factor mediating the effect of sequence frequency on nonword repetition accuracy. As noted earlier, low-frequency target sequences often contain one
segment that is itself lower in frequency than the analogous segment in the paired high-frequency sequence.
For example, the low-frequency sequence /moI/ contains
the vowel /oI/, which is very infrequent in English. The
matched high-frequency sequence /moe/ contains the
vowel /oe/, which is much more frequent than /oI/ in English words. If we assumed that low-frequency phonemes
were inherently more difficult to produce than high-frequency phonemes, then we might hypothesize that the
effect of phonotactic probability on repetition accuracy
was due simply to the phonetic composition of the two
sequence types. If this was the case, then we would find
that (a) accuracy of production of that sound in a familiar word predicted accuracy of production of that sound
in a nonword and (b) frequency of the sequence in which
that sound was embedded would not predict performance
beyond what was predicted by accuracy in real words.
The number of participants analyzed in these regressions was smaller than in the analysis of nonword repetition accuracy, because data from the PI for 2 of the
children with PD were lost owing to recording problems.
To evaluate this question, we ran a series of regressions predicting phoneme accuracy in nonwords from
accuracy of production of the same phonemes in real
words. Vowels and consonants were examined separately.
The dependent measures in these regressions were based
on the nonword accuracy sums described in the Method
section. The dependent measure in the first regression

If the effect of frequency on nonword repetition was simply due to the intrinsic difficulties of producing the
sounds that make up the low-frequency sequences, then
the difference in real-word accuracy sums would predict the frequency effect. If the frequency effect were
related to some other aspect of development, then we
would predict that there would be no relationship between those measures.

Sequence frequency and measures of speech perception. The next set of analyses examined whether the frequency effect could be predicted by measures of the participants' skill in speech perception. In this analysis, we
examined whether whole-word discrimination accuracy
predicts the frequency effect. We also examined relationships between whole-word discrimination and average nonword repetition accuracy.

Results of these regressions are presented in Table
7. Not surprisingly, there was a high correlation between
nonword accuracy sums and real-word accuracy sums,
when the entire group of 80 children was examined.
Children who produced sounds accurately in familiar
words were also likely to produce sounds accurately in
nonwords, and vice versa. However, this relationship was
not present for the children with TD, either for vowels
or for consonants because of the limited range of performance on both the dependent and independent measures
in this population. It was robustly present for the children with PD for both phoneme types.

We used simple regression to examine these relationships. In the first set of analyses, mean accuracy
(averaged across high- and low-frequency sequences)
was the dependent measure. Whole-word discrimination
was the independent measure. When the entire group
of participants was examined, a significant relationship
was found, F(1, 76) = 13.9, p < .01. Whole-word discrimination accounted for 16.1% of the variance in accuracy
scores. The standardized beta coefficient was .401, indicating that participants with better speech perception
ability also evidenced more accurate nonword repetition.
When the two groups were examined separately, a significant predictive relationship was only found for the
children with PD (R2 = 13%), F(1, 76) = 5.4, p < .05,  =
.36. No relationship was found for the TD children. However, once again the children with TD in this group
showed a much smaller range of performance on the
speech perception task, and the lack of a predictive relationship might have been due to this.

The correlation between the real-word accuracy
sums and the nonword accuracy sums in the entire group
of participants with TD and PD and in the group with
PD only contrasts strongly with the lack of a relationship between the frequency effect and the difference in
real-word accuracy sums. That is, the effect of sequence
frequency on repetition accuracy was not predicted by
measures of the difference in accuracy for the same
sounds in real words. Thus, there is an effect of sequence
frequency on accuracy of consonant and vowel production, over and above the accuracy of articulation of the
sounds making up the high- and low-frequency sequences in real words. This suggests that developmental decrease in the frequency effect does not index a
simple developmental decrease in the difference in production accuracy for the phonemes composing the highand low-frequency sequences, as measured by the PI.

In the second set of analyses, the frequency effect
was the dependent measure. Again, the frequency effect was the difference in mean accuracy between the
high- and low-frequency sequences, using the 6-point
scale. Whole-word discrimination was the independent
variable. When the entire group of 80 participants was
examined, the relationship was not significant. The
same was true when the 40 children with TD and the
40 children with PD were examined. That is, the magnitude of the frequency effect was not affected by speech

perception ability. While children with poorer speech perception ability were less accurate than children with
better speech perception ability on repetition accuracy
overall, they were not disproportionately poorer at repeating low-frequency sequences.

age never accounted for a significant proportion of variance in either dependent measure, it is not included in
this table.
As Table 8 shows, GFTA percentile rank predicted
a large proportion of variance in mean accuracy for both
the entire group of 80 participants and for the 40 participants with PD. In addition, the PPVT-III raw score
predicted an additional proportion of variance for the
same two groups. No significant predictors of performance were found for the 40 TD matches. When the
frequency effect was examined, GFTA was a significant
predictor for the group of children with PD only. That
is, despite the much larger range of GFTA scores when
the two groups were combined, GFTA was not a significant predictor of the frequency effect. This is not surprising, because the children with PD as a whole showed
a smaller frequency effect in the group analyses. In contrast, the EVT raw score predicted a significant proportion of variance in all three regressions.

Sequence frequency and vocabulary size. The regression analyses presented thus far found no relationship
between perceptual or articulatory skills and the frequency effect. Edwards et al. (2004) observed an interaction between vocabulary size and sublexical sequence
frequency. Smaller effects of sublexical sequence frequency were noted in children with larger vocabularies.
We wanted to examine this same relationship for the
PD and TD participants in this study. As in the earlier
study, we examined the relationship between phonotactic
probability effects and vocabulary-size effects using hierarchical multiple regression. We ran two sets of regressions. In the first set of regressions, mean accuracy
(averaged over both high- and low-frequency sequences)
was the dependent measure. This set contained three
individual regressions, one for the entire group of 80
participants and one for each of the two groups. The
regression had four independent measures: age, percentile rank on the GFTA, and log-transformed raw scores
on the EVT and the PPVT-III. The variables were entered in a fixed order: age was forced as the first variable, GFTA was forced as the second variable, and
PPVT-III and EVT raw scores were then entered
stepwise if they accounted significantly for any additional variance ( < .05). The second set of regressions
examined predictors of the frequency effect, that is, the
difference in accuracy between high- and low-frequency
sequences. Again, three separate regressions were conducted, and the independent measures for these regressions were the same as for the first set. The results of
these regressions are summarized in Table 8. Because

To illustrate the relationship between EVT score and
the frequency effect, in Figure 3 we plotted mean accuracy scores for the high- and low-frequency sequences
against the log-transformed raw EVT scores for the
whole group of 80 children (top), the children with TD
(middle), and the children with PD (bottom). Figure 3
shows an interaction between vocabulary size and
phonotactic probability. That is, the regression lines for
the high-frequency and low-frequency sequences are not
parallel. Instead, the distance between the two regression lines (which represents the effect of target sequence
frequency) decreases as vocabulary size increases. This
is true even for the group of children with TD, who evidence a more restricted range of performance on all of
the variables than the entire group of 80 participants or
the 40 participants with PD.

High-frequency sequences
Low-frequency sequences

One surprising finding of this series of regression
analyses is that there was a significant predictive relationship between GFTA percentile rank and the frequency effect. The positive beta weight associated with
this relationship shows that the children with PD who
had lower percentile ranks (i.e., a more severe deficit)
also had smaller frequency effects than children with
milder disorders. Given our interpretation of the size of
the frequency effect, this finding is the opposite of what
we would expect to see if PD were associated with difficulties in building phonemic representations. This apparent anomaly suggests a possible progression in the
specificity of the pattern that can be generalized. That
is, at the very earliest stages of vocabulary expansion,
the patterns that can be abstracted away from known
words are very general schema such as "labial-closure
followed by an open vowel," so that something that sounds
like [goe/] might be the word shape for cat, carrots, car,
gobble, and any new word that even vaguely fits that template. There should be no difference in production accuracy between high-frequency /koe/ and lower frequency
/gA/ until the child has accurate production routines for
both of these sublexical patterns and can abstract a representation of the sequence from the following word context. Thus, over development, the frequency effect should
have a floor as well as a ceiling. If this picture is correct,
the seemingly anomalous finding for the relationship
between GFTA and frequency effect may be due to the
children with severe PD being so impaired in their
speech-sound production that they experience difficulty
generalizing production of two-phoneme sequences to
any novel word shape, regardless of the degree to which
the sequence it was attested in lexical items.

Discussion
This study examined the ability of TD children and
PD children to repeat high- and low-frequency sequences
of phonemes embedded in nonwords. This study replicated Edwards et al.'s (2004) finding that sequences of
phonemes that are attested in few or no real words are
repeated less accurately than those that are attested in
many real words. That is, children experience difficulty
generalizing correct phoneme production to novel phonetic contexts. In addition, this study replicated the previous finding that measures of vocabulary size predict
the raw difference in repetition accuracy between highand low-frequency sequences (the frequency effect) beyond what is predicted by age.
This study expanded on previous findings in a number of ways. First, regression analyses showed that there
was an effect of frequency on repetition accuracy beyond
what would be predicted by accuracy of production of the
same sounds in real words. Second, regression analyses

found that the magnitude of the frequency effect in individual participants was independent of measures of
their speech perception ability. That is, TD children's
ability to produce sounds accurately in novel contexts
in nonwords does not appear to be related to their overall acumen or experience in perceiving and producing
sounds in real words. Taken together, these results support a model of phonological ability in which children's
flexible productive control over phonemes emerges
gradually as they amass lexical items and develop stable
mappings among acoustic, articulatory, and semantic
characteristics of those items. This productive control
allows children to produce sounds in novel combinations
in new words accurately and fluently.
Note that in the regression analyses, the only significant predictors of the frequency effect were one of
the measures of vocabulary size. Typically, this measure
was the raw score on the EVT. However, inspection of
the correlation matrices shows that PPVT-III raw score
was also significantly correlated with the magnitude of
the frequency effect in the entire group of TD and PD
participants, and the EVT standard score predicted the
frequency effect for the entire group and for the group
with TD only. We take this to be strong evidence that
the developmental decline in the frequency effect is related to vocabulary growth. We propose that categorical
phonemic representations develop that link among
acoustic, perceptual, and lexical representations in response to developmental increases in the size of
children's vocabularies. As these representations develop, children gain increasingly better productive control over phonemes as separate from the words in which
they occur. This allows them to combine them into novel
sequences in a nonword repetition task. Thus, the first
hypothesis of this experiment was supported, in that
we were able to support Edwards et al.'s assertion that
developmental decreases in the frequency effect are due
to vocabulary growth, and not to developmental changes
in speech perception or production.
A second original aspect of this study is that it compared the accuracy of repetition of children with PD to
that of their TD peers. Unremarkably, children with PD
repeated sequences less accurately than their TD peers.
However, as a group, they showed no particular disadvantage when repeating low-frequency sequences. This
finding is the opposite of what we would predict if the
children with PD were experiencing difficulty building
categorical phonemic representations. In the current
study, the children with PD were less accurate overall,
as was to be expected from their GFTA scores, but they
were not disproportionately less accurate on the lowfrequency target sequences. Rather, they were slightly
less sensitive to frequency than the children with TD.
This finding contrasts with the findings of Edwards et
al. (2004). In that study, the youngest children, who had
76

the lowest repetition accuracy overall, showed the largest effect of sequence frequency; whereas the oldest children, who had highest overall accuracy, showed only a
small difference in between high- and low-frequency
sequences. Thus, the second hypothesis of this study was
not supported. This result suggests that the problems
encountered by children with phonological impairment
are not related to the types of problems that are encountered by young, TD children.
The relationship between PD and the frequency effect was explored further with regression analyses. Regression analyses found that the children with PD with
severe deficits had smaller frequency effects than children with milder deficits. Taken with Edwards et al.'s
(2004) findings from children with TD, this suggests a
U-shaped relationship between the children's overall
phonological and lexical skills and the magnitude of the
frequency effect. Children with severe PD showed only
a small difference in production accuracy for high- versus low-frequency sequences; both were produced much
less accurately than they were by the other participants.
Children with mild PD and children with TD who had
small vocabularies in Edwards et al.'s study showed a
strong, significant influence of frequency on repetition
accuracy; high-frequency sequences were produced more
accurately than low-frequency ones. Children with TD
who had large vocabularies in the current study and in
Edwards et al. showed a small difference in repetition
accuracy for the two sequence types, and both were produced relatively accurately.
As in Edwards et al. (2004), we interpret the difference in the frequency effect between children with large
vocabularies and children with smaller vocabularies to
reflect a causal mechanism in phonological development.
Specifically, we propose that developmental increases
in vocabulary size prompt the language learner to create autonomous categorical phonemic representations.
The fact that the frequency effect was not larger in the
group of children with PD suggests that the speech-production deficits in this population are not associated with
deficits in the formation of these representations. Within
our model, this result suggests the deficits seen in children with PD are associated with difficulties forming
robust representations of the acoustic-auditory and articulatory characteristics of speech. This interpretation
is consistent with the poor performance by children with
PD on the PI and on the measure of whole-word discrimination. We propose that children with PD can make
mappings among these poorly specified primary representations, just as children with TD are able to learn
mappings among well-specified articulatory and acoustic representations. These mappings allow children the
productive control needed for production of sounds in
novel words. At the same time, the smaller frequency
effect noted in the children with severe PD may be

evidence that the articulatory and acoustic-auditory representations in these children are so poor that they do
not afford the child the opportunity to make any robust
generalization. The consequence of this is essentially
floor performance on both sequence types.
Note that the relationship between frequency effects
and vocabulary size has important implications for our
understanding of the nonword repetition task. Some
research has used nonword repetition as a pure measure of verbal working memory (e.g., Gathercole &
Baddeley, 1990). The results in this article, along with
the results of previous studies (e.g., Edwards & Lahey,
1998; Fisher et al., 2001), suggest that accurate nonword
repetition depends on a variety of cognitive skills in
addition to working memory, including access to representations in long-term memory. The findings presented
here, as well as those in Edwards et al. (2004), show
that successful repetition of a low-probability nonword
relies on a rich representational system associated with
having a large vocabulary. For this reason, the results
of this investigation are consistent with models of cognitive processing that posit continuity between long-term
knowledge and real-time processing (e.g., Fisher et al.,
2001; MacDonald & Christiensen, 2002).
In summary, the results in this article suggest that
phonological acquisition involves not only the development of well-practiced articulatory and acoustic-auditory
representations but also the emergence of a symbolic representation that links both of these primary phonological representations to each other as well as to representations of other types of linguistic knowledge in the
lexicon. Thus, phonological development sets the stage
for the even higher order generalizations about morpheme
structure and phonotactics that characterize the mature
phonological system (see Pierrehumbert, 2003, for a review). These generalizations in the adult differ from those
in the child's phonology in that they do not usually result
in production errors unless the system is stressed. However, for both the adult and the young child, phonological
generalization cannot be divorced from the words that
the speaker recognizes and produces. This result fits well
with a growing body of research that sees grammar as
an emergent property of the history of interactions between the language user and language events in the
world. In this view, we do not need to make a sharp distinction between phonological knowledge and phonological processing because the relationship between the two
is symbiotic. In these models, knowledge feeds on processing, and processing feeds on knowledge. The more a
child has heard and said a word, the better the child
knows that word: Knowledge increases because of processing. Similarly, the more words that the child has
heard and said that contain a particular phonological
pattern, the easier it will be for the child to abstract
away that pattern to use for learning new words.
