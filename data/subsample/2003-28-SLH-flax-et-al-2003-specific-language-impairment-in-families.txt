Two family aggregation studies report the occurrence and co-occurrence of oral
language impairments (LIs) and reading impairments (RIs). Study 1 examined the
occurrence (rate) of LI and RI in children with specific language impairment (SLI
probands), a matched control group, and all nuclear family members. Study 2
included a larger sample of SLI probands, as well as their nuclear and extended
family members. Probands and their family members who met specific criteria
were classified as language and/or reading impaired based on current testing. In
Study 1, the rates of LI and RI for nuclear family members (excluding probands)
were significantly higher than those for control family members. In the SLI
families, affected family members were more likely to have both LI and RI than
either impairment alone. In Study 2, 68% of the SLI probands also met the
diagnostic classification for RI. The language and RI rates for the other family
members, excluding probands, were 25% and 23% respectively, with a high
degree of co-occurrence of LI and RI (46%) in affected individuals. Significant sex
ratio differences were found across generations in the families of SLI probands.
There were more male than female offspring in these families, and more males
than females were found to have both LIs and RIs. Results demonstrate that when
LIs occur within families of SLI probands, these impairments generally co-occur
with RIs. Our data are also consistent with prior findings that males show
impairments more often than females.

Familial Aggregation Studies of Language
Impairments
Familial aggregation of oral language impairment (LI)1 has been
examined using several methods (see Tallal et al., 2001, for a complete
review). Case history studies of large families with a history of multiple members with LI have reported ranges of 24%-63% of children
with LI having at least one other impaired family member (Byrne,
Willerman, & Ashmore, 1974; Gopnik & Crago, 1991; Hurst, Baraitser,
1
Some studies describe their participants as language impaired (LI) while others use the term
specific language impaired (SLI); the terms, therefore, will be used interchangeably while
reviewing the literature. Probands in this study are described as SLI, as they were selected
based on both inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. Other family members are described as
LI, as no IQ exclusion was used in classifying them as LI.

Auger, Graham, & Norell, 1990; Ingram, 1959;
Luchsinger, 1970; Robinson, 1987). Case-control family
studies have been used to determine the prevalence of
LI in the family members of LI probands as compared
to the general population. In most cases, the proband
was clinically identified while information about the
family was collected by questionnaire (Neils & Aram,
1986; Rice, Haney, & Wexler, 1998; Tallal, Ross, &
Curtiss, 1989a; Tomblin, 1989). Across studies, the incidence of specific language impairment (SLI) in the family members of SLI probands was approximately 20%-
25% as compared to 3%-7% for control families. When
researchers used a broader phenotype (behavioral profile) that included language and learning disabilities,
rates of impairment were 42% in SLI proband families
and 19% in control families (Tallal et al., 1989a).

Family Aggregation Studies of
Reading Impairment
When one family member is diagnosed with a reading impairment (RI),2 there is a high probability that
other family members also have some type of RI (Childs
& Finucci, 1979; Halgren, 1950; Sladen, 1970). The family members of reading impaired probands have been
found to have a significantly higher rate of RI than the
general population (Pennington, 1991). Pennington and
Smith (1988) reported that in families with an affected
parent, 40% of sons and 18% of daughters also had a
reading problem. Scarborough (1998) reviewed eight
studies in which RI in parents of probands was examined, finding that rates ranged from 25% to 60%, with a
median of 46% among fathers and 33% among mothers
(see Grigorenko, 2001, for a complete review).

Sex Differences
Results of previous family aggregation studies are
not consistent in reporting sex differences in LI and/or
RI. Although the majority of studies found unidirectional
sex differences (more impaired males than females),
rates of impairment among various family members
(mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers) differed across studies. When Tomblin and Buckwalter (1994) tested the
parents and siblings of SLI probands, they found that
fathers and brothers had a higher incidence of LI (40%
and 24%, respectively) than did mothers and sisters (15%
and 6%, respectively). Lewis (1992) found that brothers
of probands showed the highest incidence of LI (42%),
while sisters had a rate of 22%. They did not find any

Some studies of RI describe participants as having dyslexia, developmental dyslexia, or a developmental reading disorder. We have chosen the
term RI based on our definition, which states that a participant must be
significantly impaired on at least one measure of reading (i.e., Word
Attack). Because a comprehensive test of all reading skills was not part of
the battery, we chose to use the term RI.

differences between rates in mothers and fathers. Tallal
et al. (2001) also found similar rates of impairment in
mothers and fathers as well as higher rates for brothers
than for sisters of SLI probands. On the other hand,
Rice et al. (1998) failed to find significant sex differences
in the families of SLI probands. Variations in proband
ascertainment, impairment definitions, sample size, and
testing methods (questionnaire vs. current testing) may
all contribute to differences across studies.

Genetic Linkage Studies
Over the past 10 years, several studies have identified potential genetic loci based on specific phenotypic
data for dyslexia and, more recently, for SLI. Significant linkage on Chromosomes 2, 6, 15, or 18 has been
found in studies of individuals with dyslexia (Cardon et
al., 1994; Fisher et al., 1999; Gayan et al., 1999;
Grigorenko et al., 1997). Recently, two genome scans for
SLI-susceptibility loci found genome-wide suggestive
evidence for loci on 16 and 19 (The SLI Consortium,
2002) and significant evidence for linkage to 13 (Bartlett
et al., 2002). Importantly, there was no evidence in either sample of SLI families for linkage to 7 in the region
where FOXP2, the gene implicated in a severe form of
oral-motor apraxia and speech impairment (which may
also include a major locus for autism) was cloned (Collaborative Linkage Study of Autism, 1999/2001; International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium,
1998; Lai, Fisher, Hurst, Vargha-Khadem, & Monaco,
2001; Newbury et al., 2002). Furthermore, there was no
evidence of linkage on Chromosomes 2, 6, 15, or 18, as
has been reported for dyslexia.
Although behavioral studies have demonstrated a
relationship between SLI and dyslexia, and many of
these have also implied that there may also be a familial genetic relationship, no published studies to date have
identified similar genetic loci. This may not be surprising due to substantial sampling differences and assessment strategies among studies, as well as the differences
in phenotype classification used for linkage. To address
this issue, Bartlett et al. (2002) recently used a reading
phenotype to detect gene linkage in SLI families and
found significant linkage on Chromosome 13. Chromosome 13 yielded a test statistic of 3.92 (Log10 likelihood
ratio) with an associated p value of less than .01 after
correction for multiple tests across the genome and accounting for multiple phenotypic classifications. This
was the first study to report a significant genetic linkage for a reading phenotype in families identified based
on an oral language phenotype.
Despite large amounts of behavioral research supporting relationships between RI and oral LI, there is
little evidence at present of similar genetic loci, at least
when comparing genes linked for dyslexia with those

linked for speech or language disorders. However,
Bartlett et al.'s (2002) finding suggests that careful
phenotyping of literacy and oral language skills within
the same families may someday identify genes common
to both disorders.

Early Oral Language and its Relation
to Later Reading Difficulties
Longitudinal research has indicated that children
who demonstrate difficulty in developing oral language
during the preschool years are at increased risk for later
language, reading, and general academic difficulties.
In a prospective study of early language in relation to
later language and reading skills, Bishop and Adams
(1990) observed that those children with both phonological difficulties and more generalized language problems had the poorest outcomes. Scarborough (1990)
reported that children who exhibited poor syntactic
skills and phonological production at 30 months were
later identified as poor readers. In an extensive review
of follow-up studies of preschool children with speech
and language problems published between 1965 and
1987, Aram and Hall (1989) reported that anywhere
from 40% to 100% continued to have oral language problems during the school-age years, while 50% to 75%
reported having reading and other academic difficulties. In a large prospective longitudinal study, Tallal,
Allard, Miller, and Curtiss (1997) annually assessed the
language and emerging academic skills of 100 LI children and their age-matched controls from age 4 to age
9. The LI children showed marked deficits in math,
spelling, decoding, reading vocabulary, and reading comprehension as compared to the controls, with the gap
between groups widening over time.
Early LIs have been found to affect oral and/or written language abilities throughout the life span so that
language and/or academic difficulties can extend through
adolescence and well into adulthood. Longitudinal studies demonstrate that, unfortunately, even individuals
whose early oral language difficulties appear to have
been resolved are still at risk for later language-based
deficits in phonological processing, literacy, and general
learning difficulties (Rissman, Curtiss, & Tallal, 1990;
Scarborough & Dobrich, 1990; Snowling, Bishop, &
Stothard, 2000). Stothard, Snowling, Bishop, Chipchase,
and Kaplan (1998) found that children whose oral language problems had been resolved by age 5 continued
to perform well as adolescents in the area of language
comprehension; they evidenced problems, however, in
phonological processing and literacy skills. Those children who continued to have significant language problems at age 5 continued to have both oral and written
language problems as adolescents.

532

Recent studies have shown that infants born into
families with a history of language or reading problems
run a greater risk of developing the same kinds of problems themselves (Benasich & Tallal, 2002; Choudhury
& Benasich, 2003; Gallagher, Frith, & Snowling, 2000;
Spitz, Tallal, Flax, & Benasich, 1997). In a study of children born into families with a history of language-based
learning disabilities, Spitz et al. (1997) found that by
age 3 years, these children scored significantly lower as
a group than their matched controls on measures of language, while showing no difference in nonverbal skills.
In a related family aggregation study, Choudhury and
Benasich (2003) found that 3-year-olds from families
with histories of SLI scored significantly lower on standardized measures of language and were more likely to
fall 1 or more SDs below the mean than were those from
a matched control group with no family history of SLI
(28% vs. 8%). In another prospective study, Gallagher
et al. (2000) studied children at risk for future reading
problems because of an identified reading problem in a
first-degree relative. At 45 months the "at risk" children
scored more poorly than their matched controls on measures of receptive and expressive vocabulary, expressive
language, nonword repetition, rhyming, digit span, and
letter knowledge. By age 6 years, 57% scored more than
1 SD below the mean on measures of literacy skills.

Co-Occurrence of RIs and LIs in
Individual Children
Recent research has addressed the issue of co-occurrence of language and reading problems in the same individual. In a review of studies that report incidence of
LI in children identified as reading impaired, McArthur,
Hogben, Edwards, Heath, and Mengler (2000) reported
ranges of 19% to 63%, depending on the criteria used. Of
those children who were identified as having SLI, 12.5%
to 85% also demonstrated a concurrent RI. In their own
study, McArthur and colleagues found that 55% of 110
children classified as reading impaired also had an oral
language problem, while 51% of 102 children classified
as having SLI had a reading disability. Bishop (2001) reported on the literacy skills of a group of twins with SLI
using a twin study design to investigate possible genetic
influences on language and reading. Twins with SLI who
were impaired in two or three domains of language (as
defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association,
1994) had significantly lower literacy scores and a higher
incidence of RI than controls. These studies raise the possibility that specific oral LI or specific RI may not actually be separate disorders, but rather both disorders may
share some common core elements that influence their
co-occurrence in many individuals, with patterns of deficit changing across development.

Aim of Study
Previous research has suggested that oral language
problems, as well as reading problems, aggregate within
families (Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1995; Brzustowicz,
1996; Gilger, Pennington, & DeFries, 1991; Gopnik &
Crago, 1991; Lahey & Edwards, 1995; Pennington, 1990;
Rice et al., 1998; Scarborough, 1989; Tallal et al., 1989a,
2001; Tomblin, 1989; see Stromswold, 1998, 2001, for review), and that males present with these problems more
often than females (Beitchman, Hood, & Inglis, 1992;
Lewis, 1992; Lewis, Ekelman, & Aram, 1989; Tallal, Ross,
& Curtiss, 1989b; Tomblin & Buckwalter, 1994). However,
the majority of these data were derived from self-report
questionnaires rather than from objective standardized
tests. In a recent family aggregation study (Tallal et. al.,
2001) in which both questionnaire and current test data
were collected for all nuclear family members of SLI
probands, as well as matched controls, overall familial
impairment rates for SLI based on case history questionnaires were found to be similar to those based on current
testing. However, examination of individual participants'
data showed that different family members were identified as language impaired based on questionnaires than
were identified using current testing.

how family history may influence the potential risk of
having either or both impairments.

Study 1: Case Control Study of
Language and Reading Abilities
Method
Participants
Participants were 22 SLI probands, 26 matched controls, and nuclear family members (n = 174) participating in a family aggregation study of SLI. The proband
group, consisting of students receiving speech/language
services for SLI, and a comparable, nonimpaired control group, and the families of both, were ascertained
from schools in suburban New Jersey. Specific ascertainment procedures, descriptive data, and detailed results
of language data can be found in Tallal et al. (2001).
In the current study, SLI probands met the following inclusionary and exclusionary criteria:
1.

Spoken language quotient (SLQ) standard scores of
less than or equal to 85 on an age-appropriate test
of language development (Test of Language Development-Primary: Second Edition [TOLD-P:2]; Newcomer & Hammill, 1988; Test of Language Development-Intermediate: Second Edition [TOLD-I:2];
Hammill & Newcomer, 1988; Test of Adolescent
Language-Second Edition [TOAL-2]; Hammill,
Brown, Larsen, & Wiederhodl, 1987), or a score of
less than or equal to 85 on the mean of the SLQ and
the standard score (SS) on an age appropriate version of the Token Test 3 [(SLQ + Token SS)/2].

2.

Performance IQ (PIQ) of at least 80 on one of the
following: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale
of Intelligence-Revised (WIPPSI-R; Wechsler,
1989), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-
Revised (WISC-R; Wechsler, 1974), Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R; Wechsler,
1981), or Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence
(WASI; Wechsler, 1999). For all probands, PIQ was
greater than SLQ.

In this article, we examine current test data for each
family member of SLI probands to investigate familial
aggregation for RI as well as co-occurrence of LI and RI.
Although there is strong support for a relationship between LI and subsequent reading problems, it is clear
that not all reading impaired individuals have a history
of oral LI and that not all language impaired individuals develop reading problems.
In the current studies we report rates of LI, RI, and
their co-occurrence within individuals from two family
aggregation studies. Study 1 presents the results of current language and reading tests for SLI probands and
their nuclear family members, as well as for matched
control families. Study 2 presents the results of testing
both nuclear and extended families that were identified
as having two or more individuals in the family qualifying as SLI. This extended family study is the first of its
kind to test all nuclear and extended family members
with the same battery of tests.
Both studies use only a portion of a much larger
database that includes language, reading, and perceptual measures, as well as DNA samples that have been
collected from this cohort of families over a 10-year period (1992-2002). Other data from this genetic family
study have been reported previously in Tallal et al. (2001)
and Bartlett et al. (2002). Examining the relations
among language and reading in families may enhance
our understanding of the extent to which each of these
impairments may co-occur in the same individual, how
sex may affect the pattern of these impairments, and

3

Z scores were used to convert scores on the Token Test for Children
(DiSimoni, 1978) to a scale with a mean of 100 with a standard deviation
of 15. Tomblin, Freese, and Records (1992) administered an adapted
version of the Token Test for Adults (DeRenzi & Faglioni, 1978; DeRenzi
& Vignolo, 1962) to 35 adults diagnosed as LI and 35 controls. These
adaptations were used in this study. Scores, expressed as percentage
correct, for the two groups were compared. One standard deviation below
the mean for the controls corresponded to one standard deviation above
the mean for the LI group, indicating that this test is clearly able to
distinguish between LI and normal adults. This information was used to
translate scores in current study to the same scales with a mean of 100
and a standard deviation of 15.

Hearing within normal limits (positive identification at 500 Hz at 30 dB SPL, and 1000, 2000, and
4000 Hz at 20 dB SPL).

No motor impairments or oral structure deviations

No history of autism or frank neurological disorder

Control children were matched by age and required
to meet Criteria 2-6. Only language criteria differed in
that control children had to score within the normal range
(standard score > 90 on the language test battery)

Procedure
All participants (probands, matched controls, and
their nuclear families) received all the standardized language and cognitive tasks included above (SLQ, PIQ,
and Token Test). In addition, all participants who were
of age received two decoding subtests (Word Attack and
Word Identification) of the Woodcock Reading Mastery
Tests-Revised (Woodcock, 1987). Four probands and 11
of their siblings, as well as 4 control participants and
their 5 siblings, did not receive the reading tasks because they were too young.
Standardized test scores were examined for each
participant in order to determine which family members met the diagnostic criteria set below for current
language and/or RIs.
Language Impairment (LI). An SLQ less than or equal
to 85 (1 or more SDs below the mean) on an age-appropriate form of the comprehensive language development test
(TOLD-P:2, TOLD-I:2, and TOAL-2) or less than or equal
to 85 on the mean of the SLQ and the standard score on
the age appropriate version of the Token Test.

significantly lower on PIQ than respective members of
the control group. Siblings and parents, but not probands,
in the SLI groups were also significantly younger than
respective members of the control groups. To eliminate
the possibility that differences between the two groups
on measures of language and reading could be instead
attributed to differences in PIQ or age, the relationships
between PIQ, age at testing, and each measure of language and reading were examined. PIQ, but not age at
testing, was significantly correlated with all measures of
language and reading for probands, except Word Identification. As a result, all comparisons of language and reading for probands, except Word Identification, between the
SLI and control group were performed using analysis of
covariance to adjust for differences in PIQ. Results indicated significant differences between groups on all measures for probands and for all measures except the Token
Test for siblings and parents (see Table 1).

Significant differences in the rates of LI and RI for
all family members (excluding probands) were also found
between the SLI and control group. For this same population, the overall rate of LI for the SLI group was 30%
compared to 7% in the control group, 2(1, N = 222) =
15.9, p < .01 (Tallal et al., 2001). This rate can be compared to the overall rate of RI for the SLI group, which
was 36% compared to 4% in the control group, 2(1, N =
208 = 25.9, p < .01, in the current study. Tests of the correlation between LI and RI within each group were significant within the SLI group, 2(1, N = 101) = 32.8, p <
.01, but not within the control group, 2(1, N = 107) =
3.0, p = .08. Of those family members in the SLI group
who received both the language and reading measures,
26% had both LI and RI, while the rate was only 7% for
LI alone and 9% for RI alone. This was not true in the
control group. Only 1% of family members of the control
group were found to have both impairments, while 6%
were found to have LI alone and 3% had RI alone.

Discussion
Probands differed significantly from their matched
controls on all standardized measures of language and
reading, and their nuclear family members (parents, siblings) scored significantly lower on most measures of
language and reading. For both oral language and reading the rates of impairment in the SLI families were
significantly higher than the rates of impairment in the
case control families. A significant relationship between
the rates of LI and RI was found in the SLI families,
indicating a high degree of co-occurrence within individuals. This was not true for the control families. However, the very low rates of occurrence in the control families, particularly co-occurrence of LI and RI, make any
group difference in the pattern of co-occurrence extremely difficult to interpret.
Both SLI and RI are considered common disorders
in the general population (i.e., they have high base rates).
Tomblin et al. (1997) found that 7.4% of an unselected
sample of kindergarten children met criteria for SLI,
while RI among elementary school children has been
estimated to be anywhere from 5% to 10% depending on
criteria used (Yule, Rutter, Berger, & Thompson, 1974;
Shaywitz, 1998; Shaywitz, Shaywitz, Fletcher, &
Escobar, 1990). In the current study, the rates of LI and
RI in the family members of SLI probands were 30%
and 36%, respectively. These rates far exceed the rates
found in the control families as well as those found in
the general population, and they are significantly higher
than would be expected to occur by chance if these were
unrelated disorders. This demonstrates that there is a
strong familial component, as well as co-occurrence, for
LI and RI.

Study 2: Co-Occurrence of LIs
and RIs in Extended Families
of SLI Probands
Method
Participants
Participants were 25 children identified as having SLI
(probands), 118 of their primary family members (mothers, fathers, and siblings), and 155 extended family members (103 adults: aunts, uncles, older first cousins, grandparents, and one great-grandparent; 52 children: first
cousins under 13, second cousins, nieces, and nephews)
who participated in a larger genetic linkage study. Potential proband families were solicited through local speechlanguage pathologists and announcements at national
conferences as well as from Study 1. SLI probands were
required to meet the same inclusionary and exclusionary
criteria used in Study 1. Table 2 is a summary of the sex
composition, age distribution, and performance IQ of all
participants. No significant sex differences in PIQ or age
at testing were found for any family group members
(probands, parents, siblings, or extended family members).

Procedure
Once a potential proband was identified, pedigrees
and family histories were obtained to determine if there
were any nuclear or extended family members other than
the proband with possible LIs. If so, the proband was
tested, and if he or she met the inclusionary/exclusionary criteria for SLI, the family was invited to participate in this study. Someone from each nuclear family
was asked to distribute letters to extended family members explaining the study. Once it was determined that
a part of the extended family was interested in participating, they were contacted by the researchers. Each
family member (nuclear and extended) who agreed to
participate signed an informed consent according to the
Institutional Review Board guidelines of Rutgers University for behavioral testing and for providing a DNA
sample. Each of these participants received the same
test battery as that described in Study 1.

Relationship of Participants in Study 1
to Participants in Study 2
Of the 22 original SLI proband families in Study
1, 7 either had no other relatives with an LI or their
extended family members were not interested in participating in the current study. The other 15 proband

families had a least one other family member with an
LI and agreed to participate in the extended family study.
Ten additional extended families were recruited as part
of our genetic linkage study for a total of 25 families. All
participants (SLI probands, nuclear, and extended family members) received the same battery of standardized
tests as in Study 1 and were classified as language and/
or reading impaired based on the same criteria.

Results
Missing Data
Of the 25 probands, 3 were too young to receive
measures of reading. Of the 68 siblings, 10 were too
young to receive measures of reading. Of the 103 adult
extended family members, 2 (1 male and 1 female) did
not take the Token Test, and this female did not receive
the reading measures. Of the 52 children in the extended
families, 7 (2 boys and 5 girls) did not take the Token
Test and 20 (11 boys and 9 girls) were too young to receive measures of reading.
Passage Comprehension, a subtest of the Woodcock
Reading Mastery Tests-Revised that assesses reading
comprehension, was given to some but not all participants. Because of the high percentage of missing data
(33%) on this measure, Passage Comprehension could
not be used in the classification of RI. In order to determine the extent to which classification as RI might
change based on the inclusion of reading comprehension, the relationships among Passage Comprehension,
Word Identification, and Word Attack were examined

Word Attack and/or Word Identification, was compared
to RI defined by Passage Comprehension, there was 89%
agreement, which demonstrates the high correlation
known to occur across various components of reading.
Of the 11% disagreement, only 2% were participants
identified as reading impaired based on Passage Comprehension but not Word Attack or Word Identification.
Word Attack or Word Identification identified the remaining 9% not identified by Passage Comprehension.
Thus, we can estimate that the rates of RI reported in
this study based on Word Attack and Word Identification may underidentify by approximately 2% the rate
of RI that would have been found in this population
had reading comprehension also been included in the
classification.

Incidence of Familial Impairment for
Probands Ascertained as Having SLI
By definition, all probands (100%) met the diagnostic
classification for SLI. In addition, 68% of the probands
also met the diagnostic criteria for RI. Of the nuclear and
extended family members (excluding probands) who took
both tests of language and reading (N = 242), 25% met
the diagnostic criteria for LI and 23% met the diagnostic
criteria for RI. Thirty-six percent of the parents of the
SLI probands met criteria as having LI and 36% met criteria as having RI. The incidence of impairment for the
siblings of the SLI probands was 37% for LI and 34% for
RI. The overall incidences of impairment for the nuclear

and 35% for RI. The incidences of impairment for extended
family members were somewhat lower, 16% for LI and
13% for RI (see Table 3).

Co-Occurrence of Impairments
Incidences of familial impairment for LI and RI do
not necessarily reflect the actual number of people in
whom these impairments co-occur. To examine the incidence of co-occurrence within individuals and across
diagnostic classifications, all family members were classified according to whether or not they met the impairment criteria, first for LI and then for RI. Next, individual participants who met the diagnostic criteria for
both RI and LI were identified to determine the incidence of co-occurrence of these impairments.

There were significantly more male than female offspring in these families (total males = 105, total females

Probands (male and female) scored significantly

language and reading (see Table 4). Extended family members (adults and children) scored significantly higher than
all other family members on measures of language and
reading. Parents and siblings scored significantly higher
than probands and significantly lower than extended family members, but were not significantly different from each
other. Females scored significantly higher than males on
both measures of language and on Word Attack.

Discussion
Direct testing of SLI probands, as well as their
nuclear and extended family members, revealed a significant number of participants who met the study diagnostic criteria as language and/or reading impaired.
538

Probands were selected to meet the criteria generally used
in research and clinical settings to diagnose SLI, yet results showed that for both probands and their affected
family members, language, and RIs were much more likely
to co-occur in the same individual than to occur in isolation. The high incidence of both oral LI and RI in both the
SLI probands and their nuclear and extended family members lends strong support to the hypothesis that there is
a high incidence of co-occurrence among LI and RI, at
least in families of SLI probands.
The problem of ascertainment bias in family genetic
studies has been recognized for some time (Fisher, 1934).
Ascertainment bias results when sampling is assumed
to be random when in fact it is not (as in our studies). To
account for this bias, we have applied what is termed
single ascertainment corrections. For single ascertainment corrections to be valid, it is assumed that not all
families segregating SLI have been ascertained (if all
the SLI families were ascertained this would be termed
"complete ascertainment"). Furthermore, the probability of ascertainment is assumed to be proportional to

the number of affected persons in the pedigree. As both of
these assumptions are approximately correct for Study 1,
simple exclusion of the proband from the analysis corrected the potential bias in co-occurrence rates. However,
Study 2 represents two additional complexities for the ascertainment process that are not easily accounted for.
Additional families who participated in Study 2 were recruited for a gene linkage study. Ascertainment was based
on at least two affected family members (instead of just
one affected family member as in Study 1) and also represented extended familial relationships. The proportion of
genes shared by extended family members drops off monotonically from the proband. Taking this into account, the
rates from Study 2 may not generalize to the general population. They do, however, indicate the same trends seen
in the nuclear families from Study 1, which indicates that
our ascertainment corrections, while not strictly correct,
do approximate the true ascertainment correction. Furthermore, it will be important to determine in future studies whether this pattern of co-occurrence of LI and RI also
occurs in families of a reading impaired proband.
Tallal et al. (1989a) was the first family aggregation
study to address the possibility of co-occurrence of language and reading deficits in family members of SLI probands. Based on questionnaire data, family members of
SLI probands were classified as "impaired" if they reported
a personal history of LI, RI, and/or academic failure. Using this broader classification, a much higher incidence

of impairment (42%) was found in nuclear family members of SLI probands than is generally reported in the
literature based on a more focused definition of SLI alone
(about 25%). In the current study, 45% of the nuclear family members (excluding probands) were found to meet criteria as language and/or reading impaired based on current testing, a similar incidence rate to that found in Tallal
and colleagues'.
A lower incidence of LI and/or RI (22%) was found
in the extended family members. Previous studies
(Lewis, 1992; Rice et al., 1998) have also reported lower
incidence of impairment in extended family members
than nuclear family members, and have suggested that
when family history questionnaire information is used
to determine the status of extended family members,
rates might be influenced by how well the informant
(usually the parent of the proband) knew the extended
family member. However, different concerns arose in the
current study. Whereas every first-degree relative of the
proband was tested, only some extended family members agreed to be tested. Family members who did not
agree to be tested may have included a disproportionate number who are impaired or not impaired, causing
true impairment rates to be over- or underestimated.
Furthermore, as shared genetics decreases with distance
from the proband, so does disease risk when the underlying disease liability is largely genetic. Extended family members have spouses who are genetically unrelated

to the nuclear family and, consequently, the gene pool is
even further diluted once they have offspring.
These data may also be disproportionately influenced by families with both parents affected. In a pedigree analysis that demonstrated a high degree of co-occurrence of language, reading, and auditory rate
processing impairments in a large multigenerational
family, Flax et al. (2001) found a high degree of assortative mating together with a higher affectation rate. Likewise, Tallal et al. (1989a, 2001) found a higher incidence
of impairment in offspring when both parents were impaired. These data suggest that differences in the proportion of families with both parents affected in one study
may alter the affectation rate reported across studies.
In the current study the overall familial incidence
of impairment (excluding probands) was significantly
higher for males than for females (43% vs. 15% for language; 28% vs. 18% for reading), consistent with previous studies that have reported sex differences in LI and
RI (Lewis, 1992; Tomblin, 1989; Tomblin & Buckwalter,
1994). However, there is still considerable disagreement
as to whether there is truly a sex difference in these
disorders. Shaywitz et al. (1990) challenged the presence of true sex differences in language or reading disorders by suggesting that reported sex differences actually reflect ascertainment bias. In an epidemiological
study, they found that when children were identified as
having an RI based on clinical or school referrals, boys
were 2 to 4 times more likely to be identified as having
an RI than girls. However, there was no significant sex
difference when a comprehensive battery of standardized measures was used to identify children with RIs
based on a nonselected sample. They concluded that sex
differences reported in clinical samples may result from
boys being referred for services more often than girls,
based on behavioral rather than reading problems.
Although gender of the affected individual clearly
may influence the chance that a proband will be referred
for study, resulting in ascertainment bias, it is unknown
how these factors in affected relatives may influence the
chance that a family will be referred for study or that
members of the extended pedigree will agree to participate. Therefore, although our findings are consistent
with the prior reported increased rates of impairment
in males, it is possible that our resulting gender difference was also influenced by ascertainment bias.
There remains considerable disagreement in the literature pertaining to the exact relationship between oral
LIs (i.e., SLI) and RIs (i.e., dyslexia). Evidence from this
family genetic study demonstrating the co-occurrence
of oral LI and RI among family members of SLI
probands, coupled with the fact that these deficits occur
together in the same individual considerably more frequently than they occur alone, lends strong support to
540

the idea that language and reading may be interrelated
impairments stemming from a combination of genetic
and/or environmental factors. Children diagnosed with
language difficulties in preschool are known to be at
greater risk not only for continued oral language problems but also for the subsequent development of literacy
problems (reading, writing, and spelling) once they enter school (Aram & Hall, 1989; Bishop & Adams, 1990;
Tallal et al., 1997). These facts, combined with the cooccurrence of LI and RI in families of SLI probands, are
of considerable importance when looked at from the perspective of early identification and treatment of children
at risk for language/learning deficits.
Family aggregation studies have consistently demonstrated that a positive family history of LI puts each
child born into these families at considerably higher risk
of developing similar deficits (Scarborough, 1990; Spitz
et al., 1997). These findings suggest that information
pertaining to family history of both LI and RI may provide valuable information to consider in making decisions pertaining to early intervention for both LI and
RI. In addition, these findings highlight the importance
of evaluating the oral language abilities of all children
experiencing difficulty learning to read and (when appropriate) providing interventions that address both
their oral and written language problems.
Conti-Ramsden and Botting (1999) suggested that
"SLI is not a unitary, static condition, but a dynamic difficulty that evolves with developmental time" (p. 1202). The
considerable degree of co-occurrence between LI and RI
in family members of children with SLI, across generations, supports this view of developmental language impairments. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate the
interrelatedness of these mental functions, both within
individuals and across generations within families.
Aggregation studies alone cannot determine the extent to which genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to this pattern of co-occurrence of LI and RI in SLI
probands and their family members. Expression and penetrance of spoken language disorders are rarely complete
and may involve complex interactions between genes and
the environment (Stromswold, 1998). This is evidenced
by the fact that in the current study phenotypic profiles
differed among affected family members. Gene linkage
analyses currently in progress are attempting to link the
phenotypic data to DNA derived genotypes from these
families. Based on the pattern of frequent co-occurrence
of LI and RI evident in the phenotypes of these families,
both distinct genes for language impairment and genes
that may show linkage for RI are currently being sought.
