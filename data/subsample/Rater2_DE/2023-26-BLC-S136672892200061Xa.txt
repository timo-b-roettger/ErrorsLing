Abstract
Previous studies analysing the differences in emotionality in first and second language suggest
that affective content of lexical items is modulated in certain contexts. This paper investigates
the differences in valence and arousal ratings for 300 early words, in both oral and written
modalities, through speakers' subjective appraisal of words given by two immersion groups
of Spanish late bilinguals (Chinese and European) compared with a group of native speakers.
The main goal of our study is to identify the lexical areas where variability occurs, regarding to
a set of affective (emotional charge and intensity), grammatical (nouns, adjectives and verbs)
and semantic (concreteness) features of words. Our results show that valence is the dimension
where the greatest variability is observed between native and bilinguals, although the influence
of the independent factors differs considerably. Besides, arousal yields illuminating data
regarding the grammatical category of words and differentiation between the groups of
participants.

1. Introduction
In recent decades, one of the most frequently repeated claims in scientific discourse has been
that cognition and emotion interact in the complex processes carried out by humans, including communication and learning (Damasio, 1994; Dolan, 2002). In both of these, language
emerges as the creator and bearer of the emotional component that accompanies human
experiences (Lindquist, MacCormack & Shablack, 2015). Hence, research interest in the relationship between language and emotion has grown exponentially in disciplines such as linguistics, anthropology, cognitive psychology and neuroscience (see reviews by Citron, 2012;
Hinojosa, Moreno & Ferre, 2019; Pavlenko, 2012; Robinson & Altarriba, 2014). Likewise,
there is also a need in bilingualism and language learning to understand how cognitive processes interact with the emotional content of the verbal elements that new speakers incorporate
into their linguistic system. Thus, further research on how and to what extent new words in the
bilingual lexicon incorporate affective meaning, especially in the early stages, can shed light on
how vocabulary is integrated into learners' linguistic knowledge, how this differs from their
native language system and how learning contexts affect the development of lexical
competence.
Studies on emotional words in different languages indicate that the cultural context in
which speakers are immersed determines not only the breadth of emotional vocabulary, but
also how emotions are perceived, understood and described, so that each language possesses
a unique emotional space (Dewaele, 2010; Robinson & Altarriba, 2014). Numerous studies
are devoted to determine how emotionality varies in a speaker's first language (L1) and second
or foreign languages (L2). Although these have sometimes differed widely in approach and
methodology and have obtained diverse results, they all tend to agree that the effects of emotion are weaker in second languages, especially as regards the perception of emotions.
One of the models for exploring the emotional component of vocabulary is the explicit and
subjective appraisal of the emotional connotations of words. Thus, words such as party or gift
elicit high emotional arousal in the speaker-listener and carry a positive emotion while illness
or mistake also bear high arousal but negative emotion.
Research on emotionality and second languages has examined emotional words broadly,
those that refer directly to an emotion or feeling (anger, joy). These appear to have a different
status within the mental lexicon (Pavlenko, 2008) and their semantic space is constructed from
componential features of emotional experience (Soriano, 2013). In addition to emotional
words, our word corpus included emotion-laden words, which are words that do not explicitly
refer to emotions but nevertheless carry them (party or illness). In native speakers, these two
categories often elicit behavioural differences (Pavlenko, 2008), but Kazanas and Altarriba
(2016) indicate that the distinction between them is less robust in a second language. In addition, we included words considered neutral or less-emotional-charged words in studies on
emotion (book or mouth), in the belief that such words possess traces of emotional charge
derived from their contexts of use, especially in relation to positive or negative connotations.

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

Since the measurement instruments we used enabled speakers to
rate emotional variables on a scale, our pool of vocabulary incorporates the three types of words mentioned, as an innovation
from previous studies. This enabled us to construct a vocabulary
to be tested as close as possible to the one learners are exposed to
during the process of lexicon acquisition. We were also interested
in assessing both oral and written word perception. Most cognitive and neurocognitive studies use only written stimuli because
these avoid additional non-verbal emotional information
(Citron, 2012), but in terms of second language speakers' communicative skills, we believe it is important to compare both modalities in order to determine any modulations in the emotional
content.
Thus, the main goal of this study of applied psycholinguistics
to bilingual vocabulary is to explore how two groups of immersion learners of Spanish as a foreign language, each from different
cultural backgrounds and writing systems (Chinese and
European), assessed two emotional dimensions of words (valence
and arousal) in their L2 compared with native speakers. Our
second group of research questions consider a series of different
word characteristics, such as affective (positive, neutral and negative words), grammatical (nouns, verbs and adjectives), and
semantic (concreteness) features in order to identify the lexical
areas where emotional resonance differs between groups. In addition, oral and written verbal stimuli are considered to determine
whether modality influences the transfer of emotionality. So, these
are our research questions:
1. To what extent do the emotional dimensions of valence and
arousal vary in two groups of immersion learners of Spanish
(Chinese and European) compared with natives?
2. Do inner characteristics of words (affective, grammatical or
semantic) influence the degree of variation? Does written or
oral modality also affect the emotional rates? Are there interactions in variation between word features and modality?

2. Theoretical background
2.1. Words and emotion in L1 and L2
Words in a first language contain an emotionality that is constructed through speakers' lifelong experience of the concepts
represented by linguistic elements (Pavlenko, 2008, p. 155). The
construction of this emotionality involves a combination of factors that have to do with linguistic meaning, shared by all speakers
of a language, and experiential characteristics that vary from one
person to another. In an L2, acquisition of the emotional associations of words is influenced by a number of interrelated dimensions, such as importation of meaning from the L1, frequency
of use, context, socialisation and new learning experiences.
Furthermore, language learning is a highly emotional process,
not only because it requires simultaneous neurological activation
of cognition and emotion (Eder, Hommel & de Houwer, 2007),
but also because it generates a rich context of social interaction
and personal growth.
One of the major claims in research on emotion in bilingual
speakers is that it can be activated through the L1 and L2, so
that the effect of emotion on cognitive tasks can be found in
both languages. However, the key question is whether the effect
of emotion is equally strong in the two languages and if not,
what factors determine these differences (Robinson & Altarriba,
2014). Level of proficiency, order of language acquisition,

477

language dominance, age and learning context influence the degree
of arousal of emotional resonance in the L2 (Caldwell-Harris, 2014;
Degner, Doycheva & Wentura, 2012; Dewaele, 2004, 2010;
Pavlenko, 2012;). Analysing differences in emotional permeability
in the L2 is hampered by the fact that bilingual speakers and L2
or foreign language learners present widely diverse individual characteristics (De Groot, 2011). This situation, whereby particular characteristics determine emotionality, has been called the EMOTIONAL
CONTEXT OF LEARNING (Harris, Gleason & Aycicei, 2006). Hence,
another key factor is whether learners have experienced secondary
affective socialisation in parallel with language learning itself
(Dewaele, 2006; Pavlenko, 2008).
When bilinguals are highly proficient in their L1 and L2, emotional arousal tends to be similar in both languages (Altarriba &
Basnight-Brown, 2011; Ferre, Garcia, Fraga, Sanchez-Casas &
Molero, 2010), whereas if they are not equally proficient in
both, the effect will be stronger in their dominant language
(Robinson & Altarriba, 2014). Thus, previous studies indicate
that the effect of emotion on second language words is reduced
in sequential bilinguals (people who learn an L2 after mastering
their L1), especially those who leant their L2 at a later age
(Aycicei-Dinn & Caldwell-Harris, 2009; Eilola & Havelka,
2011; Harris, 2004). It follows that less-proficient bilinguals may
be unaffected by the emotional content conveyed, with less
engagement in communication, and that certain language tasks
may therefore be affected by this reduced emotional component.
However, this reduction in automatic affective processes in the L2
can also be seen as an advantage. For example, "thinking in a
second language" may reduce bias in decision-making because
the second language generates greater emotional distance than
the native language, an effect that Pavlenko (2012) has called disembodied cognition.
2.2. Measuring emotion in bilingual lexicon
Researchers have used varying approaches to study the emotion
contained in lexical items. Some studies have been based on
speakers' perceptions of the emotional expressive power of each
language and the emotional use of language in communication
(alternation and code-switching) (Dewaele, 2004, 2010), while
others have focused on the processing of emotion-laden words
and phrases. These latter have analysed the results of cognitive
tasks which reveal the automatic effect of emotional content -
for example, memory tasks (Aycicei-Dinn & Caldwell-Harris,
2009; Baumeister, Foroni, Conrad, Rumiati & Winkielman,
2017), word recognition tasks (Altarriba & Bauer, 2004; Degner
et al., 2012; Kazanas & Altarriba, 2016), and affective Stroop
tasks (Eilola & Havelka, 2011; Eilola, Havelka & Sharma, 2007;
Sutton, Altarriba, Gianico & Basnight-Brown, 2007); also via
skin conductance (Caldwell-Harris & Aycicei-Dinn, 2009;
Harris, Aycicei & Gleason, 2003; Harris, 2004) or neuroimaging
techniques (Fan, Xu, Wang, Zhang, Yang & Liu, 2016;
Hernandez, 2009).
Within the word recognition tasks, one of the most productive
methods has been to use an introspective approach, where speakers attribute words with a series of emotional characteristics considered universal. This so-called DIMENSIONAL APPROACH has the
advantage of being relatively neutral in terms of language and culture specificities. Assessments are obtained through a series of
subjective measurement questionnaires in which speakers are
asked to rate words according to different dimensions on a
scale. These affective measures have given rise to a comprehensive

478

set of emotional norms for native speakers, almost all derived
from the norms of the ANEW questionnaire (Bradley & Lang,
1999) applied to different languages such as Spanish
(Stadthagen-Gonzalez, Imbault, Perez Sanchez & Brysbaert,
2017). Comparisons between the norms of different native languages indicate that speakers understand the emotional charge
of words in a fairly similar way (Soares, Comesana, Pinheiro,
Simoes & Frade, 2011). However, norms for second or foreign
language speakers are scarce (Garrido & Prada, 2018; Imbault,
Titone, Warriner & Kuperman, 2020), probably because of the
diversity of speaker or learner profiles. As a result, experimental
designs with bilinguals have often been based on data obtained
from native speaker norms, subsequently translated into the corresponding second language, which in some cases may bias the
results, especially in less-proficient or late ones.
Among the different affective dimensions identified (see
Brosch, Pourtois & Sander, 2010 for a review), the most frequent
in literature are valence and arousal. Valence refers to the extent
to which a word elicits a positive or negative emotion and
prompts a reaction of attraction or defence (Colombetti, 2005),
whereas arousal indicates the degree of emotional activation
that a term elicits, how much calmness or excitement it transmits
(Strauss & Allen, 2008). These two characteristics are independent
within the two-dimensional structure of affect, both behaviourally
and in terms of brain dissociation, although they often show patterns of interrelation (Citron, 2012; Kousta, Vinson & Vigliocco,
2009; Kuperman, Estes, Brysbaert & Warriner, 2014). In studies
with monolinguals, valence appears to be more pronounced
because it is related to the appraisal of an emotional situation,
whereas arousal is associated with less well-defined, uncontrolled
physiological reactions (Citron, 2012). Typically, words with more
valence, whether positive or negative, tend to have higher arousal
values, and words with a negative valence tend to be rated with
higher arousal than positive words (Citron, Weekes & Ferstl,
2014). It appears this can be explained by the automatic vigilance
hypothesis, which states that negative valence is more important
for survival as it activates the defence mechanisms against threatening situations that emerged during evolution. However, some
studies with natives have found no asymmetry between positive
and negative valence (Kousta et al., 2009). In general, it has been
widely demonstrated in psycholinguistics that both play a role in
the mental lexicon organisation of native and bilingual speakers
alike (Altarriba & Bauer, 2004). Moreover, these dimensions may
be perceived differently in an L1 and an L2, especially for some specific types of term such as taboo words and swear words (Dewaele,
2010; Garrido & Prada, 2018; Imbault et al., 2020).
Studies have also been conducted of the relationship between
these emotional attributes and other semantic-lexical factors
that influence processing tasks, such as formal features (e.g., number of letters, frequency) and semantic features (e.g., concreteness,
imaginability) (Altarriba, 2003; Kuperman et al., 2014). Regarding
the latest, emotional words and abstract words have shown a special relationship. At first, emotional words were considered to
form part of the abstract word set in terms of processing.
However, Altarriba and Bauer (2004) demonstrated that they
are not processed in the same way and should be considered a
separate lexical group in the linguistic system. This may be
because emotional words are learnt very early in L1: language
development coincides with the development of emotion regulation systems, which encompass autobiographical memories and
the sensory, visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, kinaesthetic and
visceral systems (Pavlenko, 2008, p. 156). Thus, emotional

Natividad Hernandez Munoz and Ana Blanco Canales

words in the L1 are more richly and deeply encoded in terms
of their semantic components.
The four previous studies comparing subjective ratings of
affective variables between L1 and L2 obtained mixed results.
Winskel (2013) compared the subjective valence ratings given
by 54 Thai (L1) and English (L2) speakers and 54 native
English speakers, using 40 words (20 negative and 20 neutral),
and found no differences between the bilinguals' ratings in both
their languages, or between English (L2) and English (L1) scores.
Meanwhile, Garrido and Prada (2018) compared the emotional
ratings given by 230 Portuguese (L1) and English (highly proficient L2) speakers for valence, emotional intensity and familiarity,
using a set of 320 words in Portuguese and English. Their results
indicate that L1 stimuli obtain more extreme scores for valence
(positive ones are more positive and negative ones more negative)
and familiarity. However, for emotional intensity, only taboo
words obtained higher scores in the L1. Velez-Uribe and
Rosselli (2019) assessed the valence of 120 oral and written
words divided into positive, negative and neutral. Their 149 participants were Spanish (L1) and English (L2) speakers living in
South Florida who made extensive use of English. In this study,
the participants rated positive and taboo words as more emotional
in their L2, while negative words were rated as more emotional in
their L1. They also found that the predictor of higher valence was
high proficiency in both languages. Lastly, in a very recent study,
Imbault et al. (2020) collected subjective valence and arousal ratings of 2628 words given by undergraduate students of English
(L2) with different native languages. Comparing the valence
data with native speaker norm scores, they found, like Garrido
and Prada (2018), that L2 responses were more moderate than
L1 responses at the extremes of the scale: the more extreme scores
were in L1, the more moderate they were in L2. In addition, a
wide difference was observed in valence between native and nonnative speakers for low-frequency words, those to which learners
have been less exposed, been more neutral for the latter. The
authors described individual patterns that predict similarity between
the two sets: the higher the degree of proficiency and the longer the
time spent living in immersion in Canada, the greater the degree of
similarity between L1 and L2 ratings. Imbault et al. (2020) linked
their results to speakers having a more incomplete mental representation of the word in the L2, especially in denotations and emotional content, as posited by the lexical quality hypothesis
(Perfetti, 2007), as well as a lower register of sensorimotor and emotional interactions for words in the L2, as argued by theories stating
that emotionality is not acquired through denotative meaning alone,
but through interaction with the words (embodied theoretical
approach to language - Barsalou, 1999).The differences between
the results of the four studies described above may be due to methodological issues, primarily differences between participants and the
sets of words used as stimuli.
In our study, we compared both valence and arousal measures,
as did Garrido and Prada (2018), and predicted that the greatest
differences would be observed in the valence domain, and that
extreme scores would tend to be moderated, in line with the
results reported by Garrido and Prada (2018) and Imbault et al.
(2020). As a major novelty, our study is the first to group bilinguals by cultural background and native language (Chinese and
European), since we hypothesised that cultural background
would influence the construction of emotions, as would previous
learning contexts in the participants' respective countries. Our
second innovation was to analyse, for the first time in comparisons with bilinguals, a set of words taken from the Cervantes

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

Institute Curriculum Plan corpus of learner words (Instituto
Cervantes, 2006), which ensured a diverse set of stimuli of varying
emotional intensity that would make it possible to obtain more
nuanced scores. In addition, all the selected words corresponded
to level A (initial), thus ensuring that the participants - late bilinguals with an intermediate level - would have been exposed in
educational contexts to these words and would thus have acquired
the denotative meaning of the words. A holistic exploration of a
learner's lexical input must include both oral and written stimulus
presentation. Hence, as with Velez-Uribe and Rosselli (2019), we
assessed all words in both modalities. In order to refine our analysis focus on linguistic characteristics of words that identify lexical areas with an altered emotional content, our third innovation
was to include stimuli features in three independent dimensions:
traditional affective factors (positive, negative and neutral words;
high- and low-intensity words), the grammatical category of the
words and concreteness as a semantic feature. Before exploring
personal and contextual factors that may influence emotional
charge, it is essential to analyse how emotional space of words
is constructed taking into account their grammatical and semantic nature.

3. Methods
3.1. Participants
A total of 149 individuals participated in this study, distributed as
follows: 55 native Chinese speakers, 42 native European language
speakers (70% German, English, Italian and French; 30% Serbian,
Greek, Russian, Slovak and Belarusian) and 52 native Spanish
speakers.
The non-Spanish-native participants (all Spanish learners)
were divided into these two categories for two reasons: the
typological and genetic similarity of the native languages
(Sino-Tibetan and Indo-European) and the native language writing system (Chinese script and the alphabetic system). All of them
were attending language immersion programmes as part of their
undergraduate or graduate curriculums, either at the University
of Alcala or at the Rey Juan Carlos University, both in the
Community of Madrid (Spain). Their global level of Spanish
was intermediate, ranged between A2 (25%), B1 (50%) and B2
(25%), according to the CEFR. Of the Chinese students, 37
were men and 18 were women, with an age range of 18 to 25
years old. In the case of the European students, 36 were women
and 6 were men, and they formed two age groups: 37 were
aged between 18 and 25 years old, and 5 between 26 and 35
years old. Most of the Chinese participants were studying Arts
and Humanities (42) or Social Sciences (9). The rest were divided
among other areas. Similarly, most of the European students were
studying Arts and Humanities or Social Sciences (15 in each case).
As regards the use of Spanish with family and friends, in both
groups, 50% (27 in the Chinese group and 21 in the European
group) reported using it frequently or sometimes and the other
50% (28 and 21), never or almost never. However, the two groups
differed in their contact with Spanish language and culture, since
76.5% of the European students scored between medium and very
high, whereas only 39.1% of the Chinese students did so.
With respect to the native speaker participants, all were undergraduate students at the University of Salamanca, studying in the
Faculty of Philology; 12 were men and 40 women, and they all
belonged to the first age group (18-25 years old). They

479

participated on a voluntary basis and received academic credits
for their collaboration.

3.2. Instruments
The valence and arousal data collection questionnaire consisted of
300 words taken from the A1 and A2 levels of the Cervantes
Institute Curriculum Plan (PCIC) (2006). There were 142
nouns, 84 adjectives and 72 verbs for the factor grammatical category; 160 positive, 90 neutral and 50 negative for emotional
charge; 167 low and 133 high for intensity; and 151 concrete
and 149 abstract words for concreteness factor.
Both emotional charge and intensity, as independent variables,
were calculated from valence and arousal data extracted from
EmoFinder (Fraga, Guasch, Haro, Padron & Ferre, 2018). In the
first case, the total scale was divided into three levels of similar amplitude: 1 to 3 were negative words, 3.1 to 6 were neutral words and 6.1
to 9 were positive words. With regard to intensity, the mean score
(4.25) was taken as a cut-off, dividing scores into high or low arousal
according to whether they were above or below the mean.
In the case of the concreteness factor, the EmoFinder database
only contained measures for about 25% of the words in our corpus. Consequently, we collected data on subjective measures of
concreteness for our 300 items in which 150 native Spanish
speakers studying at the universities of Salamanca, Alcala and
the Basque Country participated. As with intensity, the mean
(4.50) was calculated to establish a cut-off between concrete
words (above 4.50) and abstract words (below 4.50).
To select the 300 items all single words of levels A1 and A2
from PCIC were extracted (N = 1094 words). Compounds,
adverbs, complex noun phases and repeated words were not
taken into account. We also discarded 175 words that were not
included in EmoFinder and included 11 emotion words that
were not in PCIC A level (N = 926). Lexicon from initial levels
shows unbalanced grammatical categories with a high presence
of nouns (nouns = 641; adjectives = 173; verbs = 112) and valence
groups with a high number of positive words (positive = 464;
neutral = 393; and negative = 69). Our selection responds to the
motivation of including the three groups of valence (positive,
negative and neutral) in each grammatical category. The 300
items represent the 32.3% of initial corpora (22% nouns; 49.1%
adjectives; 66% verbs). So, the difference in numbers through
words factors (such as grammatical category or emotional charge)
is due to the aim of working with a real learning second-language
lexical corpus for basic levels of proficiency, not an artificial
experimental set of stimuli. Corpora offer the advantage of providing a large amount of authentic linguistic material that can
be representative of large populations, as well as allowing for a
wide variety of methodologies and approaches (Soriano, 2013).
The apparent unequal distribution of number of items in each
category is assumed by statistical analysis power.

3.3. Data collection
For data collection, the total number of words was divided into
two questionnaires (questionnaire A and questionnaire B),
which were identical in terms of the number of words for each
grammatical category (noun, adjective and verb) and for each
emotional level (positive, neutral and negative), and almost identical for the factors of concreteness (concrete and abstract) and
intensity (low and high).

480

The two groups of foreign participants (Chinese and European)
were divided into two subgroups (subgroup A and subgroup B), and
each subgroup was administered one of the questionnaires. Thus,
each participant rated 300 words: 75 words for valence and 75
for arousal presented in oral and written modalities. Participants
scored the items on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 indicated negative
or no arousal and 7 indicated positive or high arousal. An additional
box was included in case they did not know the meaning of the
word. The oral stimuli were recorded by a professional announcer,
male of medium age, with a central-peninsular Spanish accent. He
was instructed to speak neutrally, avoiding prosodic changes that
could affect emotional interpretation.
The questionnaires - consisting of four sections or tasks - were
administered in paper format and completed in class, within a
similar time frame, in the same context and without distractions.
A week beforehand, the project was briefly explained to all participants, their collaboration was requested and they were provided
with an informed consent form. They were also asked to complete
a sociodemographic questionnaire.
The group of native speaker participants was organised in a
similar way. Even though measures were available for all 300
items in the EmoFinder database (Fraga et al., 2018), they were
only for written modality. So, it was necessary to collect measures
in both modalities for this group as well. All statistical analysis
were done using SPSS.26 except mixed-effect models which
were made with R.
4. Results
4.1. General analysis
For the first research question, general comparison of overall distributions of valence and arousal rating were conducted, following

Natividad Hernandez Munoz and Ana Blanco Canales

the model of statistical simple linear regression of Imbault et al.
(2020) where the differential between native rates (L1) and each
group of non-native rates (L1-L2) is the dependent variable and
the L1 rates, the independent variable. A negative difference
means a word that receive more positive response or higher arousal in native than in non-native rating, and a positive difference
signifies a lower valence (less positive o more negative) or lower
arousal in native than in non-native scores. Figure 1 shows the
differences between values in both factors, valence and arousal,
and in two groups of late bilinguals (Chinese and European).
Words close to zero line represent similar rates in natives and
no natives. As in Imbault et al. (2020) non-native values are consistently more attenuated than native values at extreme position
of the scale: positive words are less positive (higher differential
rates) and negative words are less negative (lower differential
rates). The same pattern is seen in arousal. The best-fit regression
line demonstrated a linear effect of native ratings on differential
measurements (valence L1-Chinese L2 differential, Y = -1,049,
R2 = 29%, correlation .542, p < .01; valence L1-European L2 differential, Y = -1,265 + .290x, R2 = 40%, correlation .636, p < .01;
arousal L1-Chinese L2 differential Y = -1,342 + .36x, R2 = 16%,
correlation .398, p < .01; arousal L1-European L2 differential
Y = -1,402 + .307x, R2 = 26%, correlation .402, p < .01). In order
to delve in these differences a set of more complex analysis with interactions between and within factors has been
developed.
4.2. Mixed-effect analysis
In order to answer the second research question, to analyse how
word features and their interactions affect valence and arousal,
two adjusted mixed-effect regression analysis were developed

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

with both dimensions rates (valence and arousal) as dependent
variables. The models incorporate the main effects of six fixed
factors (grammatical category, emotional charge, intensity, concreteness, modality and group) and their interactions as well as
two random effects between participants and items with the differences on the slope of the explanatory effects. No interactions
of random effects were included.
4.2.1. Valence
The model has been partially favourable. It presents as significant
factors emotional charge (F (2, 130) = 2.20, p < .001), intensity
(F (2, 129) = 10.57, p = .001) and modality (F (1, 21289) = 20.10,
p < .001), and most of interactions where group and modality
are included (emotional charge*group F (4, 21353) = 64.360,
p < .001, intensity*group F (2, 21444) = 26.844, p < .001, concreteness*group F (2, 21391) = 8.447, p < .001, emotional charge*modality F (2, 21286) = 67.871, p < .001, concreteness*modality
F (1, 21286) = 5.196, p < .001, group*modality F (2, 21289) =
2.809, p = .06). Variance explained by fixed effects is 35% (R2 marginal = 0.35). If random factors are considered it grows until 47%
(R2 conditional = 0.47). Results suggest the convenience of the
included factors. Coefficients with significance show that interactions with a more relevance are emotional charge*group (0.40,
0.71, 0.89), intensity*group (0.31) and emotional charge*modality
(0.61). Even though category is not a significant factor, coefficients
in the interactions indicate not to discard it in subsequent analysis.
4.2.2. Arousal
Arousal model is more favourable than the valence model because
it shows significance values for more factors: emotional charge
(F (2, 130) = 22.587, p < .001), intensity (F (1, 130) = 19.550,
p < .001), concreteness (F (1, 131) = 6.445, p = .012) and group
(F (2, 20833), p < .001). Grammatical category and modality are
not significant as isolate factors. All interactions where group
factor is involved are relevant (category*group F (4, 21280) =
8.998, p < .001, emotional charge*group F (4, 21883) = 23.862,
p < .001, intensity*group F (2, 21321) = 5.988, p = .003, concreteness*group F (2, 21283) = 6.785, p = .001), and also emotional
charge*modality (F (2, 21212) = 3.046, p = .048). However, the
R2 marginal is low (0.07), so the amount of variance explained
by fixed factors is 7%. If random effects are considered, it reaches
27% (R2 conditioned = 0.239). Coefficients show that the greatest
effect on the dependent variable on the slope is caused by emotional charge (-0.824, -0.577), intensity (0.583), and interactions
of emotional charge*group. (-0.394, -0.350, -0.811) and category*group (0.203, -0.275. -0.160).
To delve into the results of mixed analysis and, specially, about
interaction between factors, a group of general linear model
(GLM) of mixed repeated measures analysis has been developed.
These models are designed from the factors that show more influence and theoretical relevance, groups and modality, and they will
allow to see in detail the contexts and lexical spaces of affective
discrepancies between L1 and L2.
4.3. Complementary Analysis
We performed various general linear model (GLM) analysis,
mixed within-and-between repeated measures ANOVA, according to 3 x 2 x 3 or 3 x 2 x 2 models for each affective dimension
(valence and arousal). Valence and arousal rates were dependent
variables, groups was a between-subjects independent variable
and modality (written, oral), emotional charge (positive, neutral,

481

negative), intensity (low, high), concreteness (abstract, concrete)
and grammatical category (noun, adjective, verb) were withinsubjects independent factors. In all of them, group and modality
were the constant independent variables, while the other four factors alternated. Despite the debate about considering affective
values as categorical ones (Warriner, Shore, Schmidt, Imbault &
Kuperman, 2017), we maintain the most frequent line of analysis
of affective scores in bilingual approach to establish comparisons
(Imbault et al., 2020; Velez-Uribe & Rosselli, 2019). Tables 1 and 2
give the means and standard deviations for valence and arousal,
respectively.

Analysis of valence
Factors: Groups, modality, and emotional charge
The data obtained from repeated measures analyses
(Greenhouse-Geisser correction) indicate a significant interaction
between the three factors (F (4,290) = 18.839, p < .001, partial
2 = .206). This demonstrates that participants in the three groups
rated the valence of positive, neutral and negative words differently, and that they also differed when rating them in the two
modalities (written words scored higher than oral words for all
three types of word and for the three groups). The partial 2 effect
size shows that the three-way interaction accounted for 20% of the
variance in scores in this test, which is a large effect size
(Richardson, 2011). Furthermore, the power analysis indicates

that this interaction had great power (100%) to detect statistical
differences.
Supplementary data from the pairwise comparison show that
in written modality, there were statistically significant differences
between the Chinese participants and native Spanish speakers in
the case of positive and negative words (in neutral words, the
three groups obtained very similar means). As can be seen in
Table1, Figures 2 and 3, Chinese participants gave lower scores
to positive words than native Spanish speakers ( p < .01), but the
opposite was true for negative words, suggesting that for the

Fig. 2. Results of written rates of valence.

Chinese learners, the gap between positive and negative narrowed,
rendering the extreme positions more moderate. This tendency is
not significative for European bilinguals in written scores; however, for the oral rates positive and negative words are also different from natives ( p < .001).
In oral modality, neutral words were perceived in the same way
by all three groups. However, in the case of positive and negative
words, the groups showed different behaviours, especially in the
case of negative words. We found that native Spanish speakers
gave significantly higher scores to positive words than the

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

Fig. 3. Results of oral rates of valence.

European and Chinese participants ( p < .01), (whereas there were
no significant differences between these latter two). For negative
words, significant differences were detected between all three groups
in oral modality, but only between the Chinese and European participants in written modality. These findings therefore show that the
largest differences between groups occurred with oral words, especially negative ones, and that the non-native speakers were less sensitive to the emotional charge of the words.
Factors: Groups, modality, and intensity
A repeated measures analysis indicated significant interaction between
the three variables considered (F (2, 146) = 10.476, p < .001), with a
medium effect size, showing that factor interaction accounted for
12% of the variance, and a power of the analysis very high ( partial
2 = .125, power = .987). Thus, the three groups of participants showed
significant differences in the valence of low- and high-arousal words in
both oral and written items (see Figures 2 and 3).
Pairwise comparisons revealed some important details that
illuminated the results obtained. In the case of modality and
groups, only one statistically significant difference ( p < .05) was
found, between Chinese participants and native Spanish speakers
in written modality, whereby the former gave considerably lower
scores to high-arousal words than native speakers, and slightly
higher scores to low-arousal words.
As regards intensity and groups, the data indicate statistically
significant differences between all three groups of participants
in the case of high-intensity words, and between native and nonnative speakers in the case of low-intensity words. In the first case
(high intensity), native speakers gave the highest scores, followed
by European and finally Chinese participants. In the second case
(low intensity), the situation was reversed: native speakers
obtained lower means than the other two groups (see Table 1).
This indicates that the European and Chinese participants perceived high-arousal words as less positive than native speakers
did and low-arousal words as more positive. These data therefore
suggest that non-native speakers are less affected than native
speakers by the intensity carried by words when assessing valence.
Factors: Groups, modality, and concreteness
Tests for within-subjects effects revealed that the interaction of
all factors was not significant (F (2, 146) = 2.270, p > .05, partial
2 = .030, power = .456). However, considered in isolation, modality

(F (1, 146) = 40.501, p < .001, partial 2 = .217, power = 1.000) and
concreteness (F (1, 146) = 35.516, p < .001, partial 2 = .204,
power = 1.000) were significant, and the interaction between the
two was also statistically significant (F (1, 146) = 14.404,
p < .001, partial 2 = .090, power = .965). In post-hoc tests, the
Bonferroni statistic indicated that groups had no effect on the
valence score ( p > .05 at all levels). In the complementary analysis
the most relevant result is that all three groups perceived abstract
words more positively than concrete ones, in written and oral
format alike.
Factors: Group, modality, and grammatical category
The Greenhouse-Geisser statistics indicated that there was no significant interaction between the factors considered (F (4,292) =
2.309, p > .05, partial 2 = .031, power = .618). Analysed in
isolation, both modality (F (1, 146) = 42.484, p < .001, partial
2 = .225, power = 1.000) and grammatical category (F (2,292) =
4.694, p < .05, partial 2 = .031, power = .679) showed significance
levels. In the case of modality, this factor explained 22% of the
variance (large effect size), whereas category only explained 3%
(small effect size). Between-subjects tests and the Bonferroni statistic showed that differences according to groups were not significant at any of the possible levels.
In pairwise comparisons, the European participants were in
full agreement with the native Spanish speakers, as both groups
rated the valence of the three categories of words similarly.
Chinese participants, however, presented statistically significant
differences between adjectives and verbs ( p < .01), with lower
means for verbs (see Table 1 and Figure 2).
In the interaction between modality and category, we found no
difference in written words by grammatical category (F (2, 145) =
1.91), but in the case of oral words (F (2, 145) = 5.63), we
observed a difference between adjectives and verbs ( p < .01),
with slightly lower scores for verbs. This difference occurred in
the Chinese group (F (2, 145) = 7.95) between nouns and verbs
( p < .05) and between verbs and adjectives ( p < .01).
Analysis of arousal
Factors: Groups, modality, and emotional charge
The Greenhouse-Geisser correction showed that there was no
interaction between the three factors analysed (F (4,274) = 1.375,
p > .05), but we did find statistically significant interaction effects

484

between place or origin and emotional charge (F (4,274) = 4.011,
p < .05). The partial 2 indicated that this interaction explained
6% of the variance, which is a medium effect size, with sufficient
power of analysis (81%). Participants in the three groups behaved
differently when measuring emotionally charged words. Modality,
on the other hand, was not a statistically significant factor. Note
also that both the between-subjects and Bonferroni post-hoc
tests were close to statistical significance ( p = .06).
Figures 4 and 5 show how the above-mentioned factors interacted. Pairwise comparisons revealed that neutral words had
lower arousal than positive or negative words, and all three groups
presented a statistically significant difference between neutral
words and the other two sets of words ( p < .05). The interaction
between non-native and native speakers is clearly evident in the
negative words. For native speakers, the words with the highest
arousal were negative words in both modalities, but a statistically
significant difference with respect to the non-native speaker
groups was only detected in oral words. These results indicate
that the arousal of negative words was very clearly lower in the
L2 in oral modality. This reduction was particularly noticeable
in the group of Europeans; in fact, the arousal of negative
words was below that of positive ones. Meanwhile, in written
items, we observed differences between the two non-native

of this study are openly available in EmoELE at

speaker groups: the Chinese participants rated positive words
lower than the Europeans ( p < .05).
Factors: Groups, modality, and intensity
There was no statistical interaction between the three factors
(F (2, 138) = 0.192, p > .05), but there was an interaction between
place or origin and intensity (F (2, 138) = 8.104, p < .05), which
explained 10% of the variance (medium effect size), with sufficient
statistical power (94%). This indicates that the three groups rated
words of more or less intensity in significantly different ways.
Native speakers tend to assign a higher rating to high-intensity
words than the other two groups, in both modalities. In fact, in the
between-subjects tests, the groups factor was very close to statistical
significance (F (2, 138) = 2.787, p = .06), and the Bonferroni post-hoc
tests indicated that the Chinese group differed significantly from the
native speaker group for high-arousal words ( p = .05). In this case,
modality had no effect on the scores, and the means were remarkably
similar for all the three groups.
Factors: Groups, modality, and concreteness
As in the previous analyses, we found no interaction between the
three factors analysed (F (2, 138) = 0.982, p > .05), but we did
observe an interaction between groups and concreteness (F (2,

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

138) = 6.532, p < .05), with a partial 2 indicating a medium effect
size, explaining 8% of the variance and sufficient power (90%).
Considered in isolation, the concreteness factor was significant
(F (1, 138) = 2.775, p < .01) and explained 14% of the variance
with a large effect size and 99% power: abstract words scored
higher than concrete words. Pairwise comparisons showed that
this latter statistical difference occurred between native Spanish
speakers and Chinese participants in written items and only
between native Spanish speakers in oral items. As for differences
between groups, these only emerged in abstract words between
the Chinese participants and native Spanish speakers, in both
modalities.
Factors: Groups, modality and grammatical category
The repeated measures analysis revealed a clear interaction between
the three factors (F (3.94, 270.46) = 3.571, p < .05). The partial 2
showed that this interaction explained 5% of the variance, indicating
a small effect size, with sufficient power of analysis (86%). In both
modalities, there were significant differences between adjectives -
the grammatical category with the lowest arousal - and nouns
and verbs, which obtained the highest scores: written (F = 7.979)
p < .01 and oral (F = 4.793) p < .05).
In pairwise comparisons, verbs obtained higher arousal scores
in native Spanish speakers and European participants (see
Table 2), but in the group of Chinese learners, verbs were the
grammatical category that obtained the lowest arousal values in
both modalities. Figure 4 illustrates descriptively the statistical difference between the native speaker and Chinese groups in written
words. Likewise, the differences between grammatical categories
were more extreme in the native speaker group, reaching statistical
significance between the three categories in written modality and
between adjectives and verbs in oral modality.
5. Discussion
Our main goal was to determine whether differences existed in
subjective valence and arousal ratings between native Spanish
speakers and two groups from different native languages
(Chinese and European). The most widespread trend in previous
research on behaviour and automatic emotion processing indicates a reduced emotionality in L2, but the results depend on
the type of task performed and individual factors, such as the
level of proficiency. Studies comparing conscious subjective
appraisals of emotional factors have also obtained mixed results.
Winskel (2013) found no difference between L1 and L2 values,
whereas Garrido and Prada (2018) and Imbault et al. (2020)
have reported neutralisation in L2 and more extreme L1 scores.
In general, our hypothesis of lower emotional resonance in the
L2 was confirmed because the results show that the scores
obtained in the L2 tended to be less extreme than those obtained
in the L1, especially for valence. However, we propose that such
general statements are insufficient to describe what is actually
happening in bilinguals' ratings and may even be misleading,
because when a number of factors are taken into account, such
as those we included (modality, grammatical category of words,
concreteness), the variations are much more complex. Thus,
some groups of words are more likely to obtain different emotional scores in the L2, both for valence and arousal, and in
some cases the learners' L1 determines the type and direction
of the variation. It has only been possible to reach this conclusion
because a diverse but cohesive set of words drawn from the
vocabulary to which learners are exposed in the early stages of

485

language learning in formal education has been considered.
Therefore, the results present a much more complex picture
that requires a detailed analysis to truly understand what happens
in a subjective appraisal of the affective content of words.
5.1. Valence and arousal in Spanish as L1 and L2
For valence, our results are consistent with the findings of previous research, whereby non-native speakers give fewer extreme
scores than native speakers, with statistically significant differences for negative words and low-intensity words, especially in
oral modality. Regarding positive words, our results do not completely coincide with those reported by Garrido and Prada (2018)
or Imbault et al. (2020), because both studies show also a decrease
in valence for positive words. Nevertheless, our results do agree
with those obtained by Velez-Uribe and Rosselli (2019), who
only observed fewer extreme values in L1 for negative words
but not for positive ones. So, negative words are consistently
less negative in L2 but there are different patterns for positive
words. Blanco Canales and Hernandez Munoz (2022) also find
this last tendency for Brazilian and Greek Spanish students in
non-immersion-context and relate this variability with sociopsychological factors like cultural context and attitudes and beliefs
through L2. The better the attitudes and higher cultural-context,
the higher the overestimation of positive words.
In terms of arousal, a tendency can also be observed in nonnative speakers to assign lower arousal scores to negative words
and high-intensity words, most evidently in oral stimuli.
However, here we found one of the first differences between the
Chinese and European groups. Whereas the Europeans' ratings
of word intensity were similar to those of native speakers,
Chinese learners assigned much lower ratings to high-intensity
words than native speakers in both modalities.
In general, the group factor gave rise to two scenarios. On the
one hand, significant differences often emerged between native
speakers and both groups of non-native speakers (e.g., described
valence scores). On the other, significant differences sometimes
only occurred between the Chinese group and native speakers,
with the Europeans falling somewhere in between and not reaching statistical significance (e.g., grammatical categories or intensity modulations).
In valence, moreover, all the factors observed in the cases of
emotional charge and intensity interacted, revealing that the set
of factors analysed exerted a strong effect on the participants'
behaviour. The results for arousal were less salient, and in fact
there were no broad interaction between the set of factors, but
the more detailed analyses evidenced significant differences in
the ratings. The disparity of our results for valence and arousal
supports the notion that these two emotional variables assess different dimensions, in line with the findings reported by Citron
(2012) and Citron et al. (2014). Whereas valence measures evaluative processes, arousal measures automatic processes. It is easier
for speakers to assess the valence or affective charge of words, i.e.,
to judge whether an item is positive or negative, than it is to assess
the degree of arousal, which refers to non-conscious processes
that are much more difficult to conceptualise. Thus, the differences in valence are more marked and more extreme than in
arousal for non-native speakers. In this respect, it should be
recalled that Garrido and Prada (2018) only observed differences
in arousal for taboo words.
One of the most significant contributions of our study is to have
conducted a detailed analysis of arousal, the nature of which is

486

difficult to analyse as it does not tend to elicit extreme scores.
Together with valence, this less-studied dimension shows internal
variations that yield illuminating data in terms of understanding
the development of the emotional component, such as the clear
reduction in the emotional intensity of verbs and high-arousal negative words in the case of Chinese students. Arousal is also a key factor
in determining differences between grammatical categories.
The fact that negative words show the greatest differences
emphasises the importance of negative emotions for the individual. Our asymmetry between positive and negative valence supports the automatic vigilance hypothesis, which states that
negative emotions are more salient because they ensure survival
to a greater degree. This is not only evident in subjective rating
tasks, but also in behavioural tasks: bilingual speakers tended to
be more fluent when talking about positive rather than negative
emotions, and in reading processes, L2 readers were more likely
to neutralise negative but not positive words than L1 readers
(Sheikh & Titone, 2016). These behaviours allow bilinguals to distance themselves from negative feelings and experiences (Dewaele
& Pavlenko, 2002).
5.2. Written and oral modalities
Modality showed a markedly differentiated behaviour in valence
and arousal. In the former, it proved a decisive factor in all analyses, revealing that written stimuli obtain higher scores than oral
stimuli, rendering positive written words more positive and negative written words less negative. This was the same in all three
groups, indicating that it is independent of whether the stimulus
is in the participants' L1 or L2. These results differ from those
reported by Velez-Uribe and Rosselli (2019), who found no differences in valence between modalities neither L1 nor L2.
As it has been pointed out, valence, as a cognitive dimension,
may be represented more consciously in our minds than arousal, a
physiological dimension. It would be expected, therefore, that the
valence would obtain higher scores in writing and the arousal in
speaking. In addition, reading is the result of a formal learning
process, whereas speaking is the result of a natural process. In
this respect, it is reasonable to expect that valence (a cognitive
process) is more closely aligned with writing than with speaking.
Our results on valence in L1 and L2 support this view. However,
we did not systematically obtain higher arousal in the oral items,
perhaps because of the difficulty involved in consciously assessing
this dimension (Citron et al., 2014).
Nevertheless, the specific cases in which we found significant
differences between native and non-native speakers occurred in
the oral modality. Although their results are not completely comparable, in the skin conductance study by Harris et al. (2003),
native speakers showed higher arousal when the stimuli were auditory. The most important patterns indicated by our results show that
bilinguals lose intensity in negative words and abstract words compared to native speakers (both in valence and arousal), and
European learners and native speakers assign higher arousal to
verbs than the Chinese group. This suggests that orality is the
basis for different emotional perceptions between L1 and L2, and
for the high resonance of negative words, abstract words and verbs.

Natividad Hernandez Munoz and Ana Blanco Canales

categories have reported differences in processing time. Palazova,
Mantwill, Sommer and Schacht (2001) have suggested that
because nouns are easier to process and are acquired earlier,
they may be processed more superficially without sustained attention to their emotional content, and consequently adjectives and
verbs in their experiments were more affected by positive valence.
Our results on arousal are only partially coincident with these
findings. In valence, no differences emerged when rating nouns,
adjectives or verbs. Nevertheless, our detailed analyses revealed
that the Chinese group assigned lower valence scores than the
European or native speakers. In the arousal results, grammatical
categories emerged as a predictor of emotional intensity. Verbs
were consistently rated with higher scores, nouns with medium
scores and adjectives with the lowest scores in the European and
native speaker groups in both modalities. This is an expected result
if we consider that the grammatical category of verbs, especially
action verbs, is the most embodied in sensorimotor processes and
emotional interaction, according to the embodied approach to language (Barsalou, 1999). This notion is coincident with the findings
reported by Bk and Altarriba (2019), who also observed that verbs
obtained higher arousal scores in native speakers of English and
Polish.
It is worth noting that the Chinese learners did not show this
grammatical category behaviour in arousal. In both modalities,
the Chinese group's verb ratings fell far below that of nouns
and adjectives. Again, our results suggest a reduced emotional
charge of verbs in Chinese learners. This may be due to difficulties in acquiring the verbal paradigm, given that Chinese is an
analytic language, whereas Europeans as a whole speak synthetic
languages. So, in the study of grammatical categories the greatest
differences between the non-native speaker groups emerged:
whereas the Europeans behaved like native Spanish speakers,
the Chinese demonstrated independent behaviour.
5.4. Concreteness
Concreteness was selected as a semantic measure for inclusion in
the analyses because it has been widely demonstrated that the processing of concrete words differs from that of abstract words
(Paivio, 1971). Furthermore, Citron (2012) highlights in neurocognitive studies that concreteness interacts with both valence
and arousal. Our results in this respect were contrary to expectations, since we hypothesise that it might be easier for non-native
speakers to attribute affective values to concrete words, which are
more easily experienced by the senses. However, we found no interaction between concreteness and group, but we did observe a constant
effect of concreteness on the independent variable, as abstract words
were scored more positively. Similarly, non-concrete words obtained
higher arousal scores than concrete words, a difference that was more
pronounced in native speakers and in oral modality, suggesting that
abstraction and orality exert an arousal effect in Spanish. Late bilinguals would be less sensitive to the arousal effect under these conditions. It would appear that emotional content is more salient in
abstract words. This may be due to the clear interaction between emotional words and abstract words, which for a long time led to them
being considered part of the same category (Pavlenko, 2008). This
result requires further exploration in the future.

5.3. Grammatical categories
It is well known that words belonging to different categories are processed differently and involve different brain regions (Citron, 2012).
Emotion studies with native speakers using different grammatical

6. Conclusions
Research on the emotional resonance of words in bilingual speakers shows that this is not a simple question to answer and that

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

detailed analyses - rather than generalist approaches - are
required that investigate the types of words in which emotional
content is altered, as well as the different first languages, cultural
backgrounds and learning contexts of second language speakers.
In this paper we have addressed at what extent new words in
the bilingual lexicon incorporate affective meaning in the early
stages of learning in immersion contexts. Explicit and subjective
appraisal of the emotional connotations of words was analysed
to contribute to the understanding of how vocabulary is integrated into learners' linguistic knowledge. We conclude that not
only a general comparison between native and non-native rates
is required, but also a depth consideration of semantic,
grammatical, and emotional features of words, in both written
and oral modalities. Our results show a decrease of emotional
charge in non-natives, especially in negative words. Regarding
the linguistic context of late bilinguals, differentials from L1
rates tend to be wider in the Chinese group than in the
European one. Moreover, the divergence of our results for valence
and arousal supports the notion that these two emotional variables assess different dimensions (e.g., grammatical category is
only a predictor of variation in arousal).
Bilinguals' word ratings may depend on different emotional
experiences in bilingual practices, such as socio-cultural or motivational elements. The processes we have described here are evidence of a dynamic interaction between lexical-semantic
processes, affective processing, socio-cultural factors and educational practices (such as the mediation of literacy).
In addition, the alteration of a word's emotional content in late
bilinguals may also be influenced by factors associated with
incomplete vocabulary acquisition, a lower frequency of use
because of a lower frequency of occurrence either in teaching
materials or in everyday interactions, or a later age of acquisition
(Imbault et al., 2020). This is particularly evident in research
using words selected from native speakers' repertoires. In our
case, we attempted to rectify this situation by using a corpus of
beginner-level words, thus ensuring prior contact with the
terms evaluated.
The present study is based on a componential and dimensional
conceptualization of emotion (Scherer, 2001, 2013; Damasio,
1994). It assumes appraisal and embodiment as basic principles
in the configuration and processing of emotionality in the lexicon
of the languages. Its main aim is to explore how linguistic characteristics of words (semantic, grammatical and affective) also influence the variability of emotional dimension in the vocabulary of a
second language, specially, early words. Although we have concluded that different mother tongues influence the change in
affective load -Chinese and European students show clear linguistic typological differences, cultural contexts and discursive styles-,
we cannot elucidate with our data how much depends on the
mother tongue and its similarities with the L2 or on the sociocultural factors associated with each group. Investigating this issue
exceeds the objectives of our study, but it should be noted that
from studies on language and emotion in second languages
from social anthropology, differentiated cultural patterns may
contribute to creating particular emotional spaces (Wierzbicka,
1999). As a future researching line, it would be interesting to
broaden the cultural factors considered, including a division of
European participants as an unitary group, and analyse the results
in the light of constructivist and anthropological theories of emotion, which consider the sociocultural context as determining
(Averill, 1980; Karandashev, 2021; Ponsonnet, 2014). These
approaches focus on the idea that differences in the structural

487

linguistic organization of emotional space are due to different cultural patterns, which contribute to creating particular emotional
spaces. In this way, it would be relevant to consider various
aspects related to social characteristics, cultural representations,
collective experiences, educational structures or attitudes and
beliefs about the language (Blanco Canales & Hernandez
Munoz, 2022; Caldwell-Harris, Staroselsky, Smashnaya &
Vasilyeva, 2012; Caldwell-Harris, Tong, Lung & Poo, 2011).
To conclude, our results show that even in immersion contexts, late bilinguals reduce the emotional content of certain lexical items as regards both the affective charge and the intensity
of words. In order for learners to incorporate affective, semantic
and sensorimotor dimensions simultaneously, vocabulary learning must be reinforced with rich experiences that stimulate the
creation of patterns in the autobiographical memory that involves
emotion regulation systems. This occurs naturally in L1 acquisition, but not necessarily in an L2, which is often taught in the
denaturalised L2 context of a classroom (Dewaele, 2004, 2010),
particularly in the case of methodologies that place an emphasis
on written presentation or learning mediated by writing. All
this leads to "the development of "disembodied" words, used
freely by speakers who do not experience their full impact"
(Pavlenko, 2012, p. 421).
