This study aimed to investigate the capacity of coordinating comprehension and production processes and the role of
phonological working memory in simultaneous interpreting. To this end we evaluated the Articulatory Suppression (AS) effect
in three groups of participants, monolingual controls, students of interpreting and professional interpreters. Three variables
were examined, the material to be studied (words, pseudo-words), the complexity of the articulations (simple, complex) and
the articulatory rate (participants produced their speech at their own rate). Monolingual controls showed AS effect in all
study conditions; students of interpreting showed AS effect in complex study conditions and professional interpreters showed
AS effect only when they studied pseudo-words and produced complex articulations. These results suggest that coordinating
comprehension and production processes in interpreters is mediated by the retrieval of lexical-semantic information and the
distribution of the speech.

Introduction
Simultaneous interpreting (SI) is a linguistic task in
which the interpreters auditorily receive a message in
a source language (SL) and they simultaneously have
to reformulate and produced it in the target language
(TL). A striking feature of interpreting is that many
cognitive processes have to be performed simultaneously.
Thus, the interpreter has to understand the incoming
message, while reformulation and production processes
of previous part of the discourse take place. According
to Gile (1997), this requires cognitive resources to
maintain the information and to coordinate all the different
mental operations that co-occur during interpreting
(e.g., listening and understanding the original discourse,
reformulation processes and speech production).
From a psychological perspective, working memory
(WM) has been proposed to have a central role in
interpreting (Christoffels, de Groot & Kroll, 2006;
Gile, 1997; Liu, Schallert & Carroll, 2004). According

to Baddeley (1986, 1996, 2000; see Miyake &
Shah, 1999, for alternative views) WM is composed
of a central executive which is responsible for
controlling and coordinating the flow of information
from the two slave subsystems, the phonological loop
and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. Finally, the episodic
buffer is a multidimensional storage and processing
component that keeps active information from the
short-term stores and the Long-Term Memory (LTM)
(Baddeley, 2000). The phonological loop is divided in
two subcomponents, a passive storage system which
maintains verbal and acoustic information temporally
(2 seconds approximately) and an articulatory rehearsal
process, similar to subvocal speech, which refreshes the
information to prevents its forgetting.
One way to explore the functioning of the phonological
loop has been to study the articulatory suppression (AS)
effect. This effect is assumed to disrupt the work of
the phonological loop when participants are asked to
overtly produce irrelevant speech (e.g., the word "the")
when they are concurrently memorizing a set of words.
This concurrent articulation prevents the encoding of
phonological information and thus, the subvocal rehearsal
process is blocked. Although cognitive load is not
excessive in AS conditions, the memory traces cannot be
refreshed in this situation and recall is impaired (Baddeley,
1986; Baddeley & Larsen, 2007; Murray, 1968).

Simultaneous interpreting, in which there is
a continuous overlap between comprehension and
production processes, might be considered an extreme
example of AS (Christoffels, 2006; Daro, 1997; Padilla,
Bajo, Canas & Padilla, 1995). However, interpreters are
able to produce quality interpretations in this situation. In
fact, previous research has demonstrated that the recall of
professional interpreters is unaffected by AS conditions.
Padilla et al. (1995) asked a group of interpreters
and control participants without training in professional
translation to perform a free recall task under normal
(silent) or AS conditions (Experiment 1). The recall of
control participants was reduced under AS conditions
relative to normal silent study conditions, while the
recall of the professional interpreters was not affected by
AS. Control participants and interpreters had comparable
working memory capacities so that between-groups
differences in recall performance were not due to this
factor. Consequently, the authors suggested that although
WM span is involved in successful interpretations, it
does not underlie the ability to comprehend and produce
simultaneously.
The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms
that allow professional interpreters to manage these
concurrent cognitive processes in an efficient way. To this
end, we explored three factors that might determine the
lack of AS effect in professional interpreters: the material
to be studied, the type of articulation and the rate of
articulation (participants distributed their speech freely).
Material to be studied
The familiarity of the material to be studied influences
the storage of information in WM. Gathercole and
colleagues (Gathercole, Pickering, Hall & Peaker, 2001)
asked a group of participants to study and recall words
and pseudo-words. The participants showed better recall
for words than for pseudo-words and better recall
for pseudo-words with high similarity with real words
than for control pseudo-words. These results suggest
that lexical-semantic knowledge associated with words
stored in LTM supports the processing of information
in WM. According to Gathercole and colleagues, LTM
might facilitate the maintenance of information in the
phonological loop or it might reconstruct decaying
information in WM during the recall phase (Thorn &
Gathercole, 2001). Padilla, Bajo and Macizo (2005)
addressed this issue directly by evaluating the AS effect
in a group of professional interpreters (Experiment 3).
The participants were presented words and pseudowords in normal and in AS study conditions. The
results corroborated the lack of AS effect with words.
However, the recall of pseudo-words was reduced under
AS condition. These results seem to indicate that
interpreters use lexical-semantic information from LTM

very efficiently so that they are able to encode information
while successfully producing irrelevant speech.
Moreover, the effect of familiarity of the material
to be studied on the functioning of WM seems to
be related to the availability of semantic knowledge
when participants memorize information. For example,
high-frequency words are more likely to be processed
semantically while the processing and learning of pseudowords is based on phonological knowledge since they
do not have semantic representations in LTM (Majerus,
Poncelet, van der Linden & Weekes, 2008; Papagno &
Vallar, 1992). The retention of pseudo-words in WM is
difficult (Hulme, Maughan & Brown, 1991), probably
because they cannot be reconstructed in WM during the
recall phase (Hulme, Roodenrys, Schweickert, Brown,
Martin & Stuart, 1997; Romani, McAlpine, Olson,
Tsouknida & Martin, 2005; Roodenrys, Hulme & Brown,
1993). Accordingly, Papagno, Valentine and Baddeley
(1991) showed that AS disrupted the acquisition of a
foreign language unless the material could be semantically
integrated.
All these results suggest that the lack of AS
observed in professional interpreters when words are
presented for study is due to their advantage in using
semantic information stored in LTM, probably because
the interpreters may have acquired superior linguistic
abilities during their intensive training. In fact, previous
research has shown that students of interpreting improved
comprehension processes and lexical access after only one
year of training in interpreting tasks (Padilla et al., 1995).
However, this research has not addressed the relation
between AS effect and the type of material to be studied in
students of interpreting and professional interpreters. In
the present study we evaluated whether the use of semantic
information in AS conditions depends on the training of
participants in professional interpreting.
Type of articulation
The continuous production of irrelevant sounds (e.g.,
the word "the") in AS conditions might not have
the same disruptive effect as the production of real
discourse in interpreting tasks. The continuous repetition
of the same word does not involve the generation of
new representations that differ from the first produced
utterance (Lewandowsky, Duncan & Brown, 2004). Thus,
it could be argued that professional interpreters might not
have interference in AS conditions from their concurrent
articulations because these articulations are very simple
relative to the discourses they produce when interpreting.
The effect of type of articulation in the processing
of information in WM has been previously addressed.
Jones, Macken and Nicholls (2004) found that repeating
the same letter (A) in an irrelevant speech task did not
increase WM load relative to a control silent condition. In

Coordinating comprehension and production in interpreting
contrast, when the letters were random, recall performance
was reduced. In addition, Christoffels (2006) manipulated
the complexity of articulations in AS conditions to
evaluate the influence of producing meaningful words
on the retention of texts. Dutch university students had
to produce irrelevant sounds (simple AS condition, de,
de, de) or a sequence of three real words (complex AS
condition, cat, dog, mouse). The complex AS condition
was more disruptive of recall than the simple AS
condition. The authors concluded that meaningful words
impose more cognitive load because they have to be
activated from LTM and they interfere with the rehearsal
and the recall of the studied material.
In the current study we explored how the complexity
of the articulations in the AS conditions influences study
and subsequent recall in control participants, students of
interpreting and interpreters.
Articulation rate
In most of the studies on AS, the articulation rate is
kept constant so that participants have to produce their
articulations at a regular rate (e.g., about 2 or 3 repetitions
per second approximately) (Baddeley, Hitch & Allen,
2009; Chen & Cowan, 2009; Richardson & Baddeley,
1975). However, this is an artificial situation which does
not resemble the way interpreters produce their output in
an interpreting task, where they regulate their productions
according to the input rate.
To our knowledge, there is no empirical evidence on the
effect of the articulation rate in AS situations. However, it
has been shown that the time taken to pronounce words in a
list influences performance in the recall phase (Baddeley,
Thomson & Buchanan, 1975; Smith & Scholey, 1992).
Moreover, other studies demonstrate that participants
adjust the temporal parameters of their motor responses
depending on the complexity of a concurrent task. For
example, Shin and Rosenbaum (2002) asked participants
to move the cursor between two dots at the time that
they resolve arithmetic operations. The results showed
that participants slowed down their motor movements
depending on the difficulty of the concurrent task.
In the field of interpreting, articulation rates are not
fixed, but interpreters take advantage of the natural
pauses in the source speech to minimize the overlap
between input and output and to reduce interference
(Barik, 1975; Goldman-Eisler, 1972, 1980). According
to Gerver (1976), the best performance in interpretation
is obtained when there is no overlap between tasks, so
that interpreters use pauses in the listening to produce
their interpretations. Therefore, it might be possible that
interpreters have acquired the ability of controlling the
temporal parameters of their productions while they
comprehend new information simultaneously in order
to reduce interference. Moreover, this ability might

331

depend on the amount of training in interpreting since
it has been suggested that professionals and novices
differ in speech planning (Davidson, 1992; McDonald
& Carpenter, 1981). Hence, in our study we sought to
study the time distribution strategies of monolinguals,
interpreting students and interpreters by allowing the
participants to freely adjust their articulation rate. We
were interested in knowing whether interpreters would
make more efficient use of speech pauses and whether
possible differences in speech rate may underlie variations
in articulatory suppression effects.
The current study aimed to investigate WM functioning
in simultaneous interpreters. To this end, we evaluated
professional interpreters, students of interpreting and
control participants in a free recall task under normal
and AS conditions. Although free recall is not involved
in interpreting, we selected this task to study articulatory
suppression because it has been widely used in previous
studies with professional interpreters (e.g. Padilla et al.,
2005). We evaluated three factors that might determine the
lack of AS effect observed in these previous studies. We
investigated access to lexical-semantic representations
during the retention phase by comparing the recall of
words and pseudo-words. The possible influence of the
complexity of articulations was examined by comparing
the production of simple and complex irrelevant speech
in AS conditions. Finally, the participants were asked to
produce their outputs at their own rate so that we were
able to evaluate possible temporal adjustments of their
productions depending on other variables considered in
the study.

Method
Participants
Monolingual controls, students of interpreting and
professional interpreters participated in the study.
The monolingual control group was composed of 20
undergraduate students from the University of Granada
(18 women). They were monolingual speakers of Spanish
without training in professional interpreting. Their mean
age was 21.1 (SD = 2.29) and their mean memory
span was 3.25 (SD = 1.09). The second group consisted
of 20 students enrolled in an advanced course of
Conference Interpreting from the School of Translators
and Interpreters at the University of Granada (17 women,
mean age = 22.8, SD = 5.52). The mean memory span
was 3.94 (SD = 1.11) in this group. The third group of
participants was composed of professional interpreters
with more than 2.5 years of experience in simultaneous
interpreting (M = 10.5 years) (9 women, mean age =
37.5, SD = 10.76). The mean WM span of this group was
4.20 (SD = 0.72).

The participants were asked to complete a Spanish
version of the Reading Span Test (Daneman & Carpenter,
1980) before the experiment. In this test, participants are
instructed to read sets of sentences presented one-by-one
and to recall the sentence-final word after reading each
set. The sets range from 2 to 6 sentences. The maximum
number of final words correctly recalled represents
the participants reading span. The results of one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed on memory
span revealed significant differences between the groups
(F(2,55) = 4.64, MSE = 1.08, p < .05). The monolingual
controls had lower memory span than the students of
interpreting (F(1,55) = 5.21, p < .05) and the interpreters
(F(1,55) = 7.66, p < .05). There were no significant
differences between the students of interpreting and the
interpreters (F < 1).
All the participants were native speakers of Spanish
(L1). English was the second language (L2) for
interpreting students and interpreters. We evaluated
L2 proficiency of students and interpreters by the
language history questionnaire previously used in our
laboratory (Macizo & Bajo, 2006; Macizo, Bajo & Martin,
2010). Participants rated their skills in reading, oral
comprehension, writing and speaking in L2 on a tenpoint scale where 1 was not proficient and 10 was very
proficient. L2 proficiency was similar in students (M =
8.46, SD = 0.55) and professional interpreters (M =
8.72, SD = 0.82) (F(1,36) = 0.61, MSE = 0.57, p >
.05). In addition, participants were required to indicate
the frequency of L2 use (write, read and speak) per week.
L2 use was similar in students (M = 3.83 days per week,
SD = 2.25) and interpreters (M = 3.93 days per week,
SD = 2.25) (F(1,36) = 3.08, MSE = 3.01, p > .05).
The participants did not report any history of language
problems. Participants were paid or received course
credits for their participation.
Design and materials
Three conditions of articulatory suppression (silent,
standard and complex) and the lexical status of the
material to be studied (words and pseudo-words) were
manipulated. The design of the experiment was a
3 x 2 x 2 mixed factorial with AS study condition
and lexical status as within-participant variables and
group of participants (monolingual controls, students and
interpreters) as between-group variable. Six lists of 16
items were constructed. Three lists included Spanish
words selected from the Alameda and Cuetos (1995)
frequency dictionary. The words included in these lists
were unrelated. The lists of pseudo-words were created
from Spanish words by replacing one letter so that these
pseudo-words were orthographically correct in Spanish
but without meaning. The lexical frequency of words was
similar across lists. The mean frequency was 248 (SD =

350) in list 1, 200 (SD = 315) in list 2 and 194 (SD = 260)
in list 3. Differences between lists were not significant (all
ps > .05). The lexical frequency of words from which
pseudo-words were constructed was comparable across
lists (M = 151.53, SD = 183.99). The length of words
(M = 6.16, SD = 1.31) and pseudo-words (M = 6.08,
SD = 0.98) ranged between 4 and 9 letters and it was
similar across lists (all ps > .05).

Procedure
Participants were tested individually in one session.
They were asked to study lists of items (words and
pseudo-words) in three AS study conditions: (1) normal
study condition, (2) standard articulatory suppression
condition and (3) complex articulatory suppression
condition. In the normal study condition participants
had to study the material in silence. In the standard
study condition, participants studied the items while
continuously producing the syllable "pa". In the complex
study condition, participants studied the items while
continuously producing three real words (mesa, silla,
sillon). The participants studied one list of words and
one list of pseudo-words in each AS study condition.
The order in which the lists of words and pseudo-words
were presented was counterbalanced such that across
participants each list was presented an equal number of
times in each AS condition. In addition, the order in which
AS conditions were presented was counterbalanced across
participants.
The experiment was controlled by a Genuine-Intel
2993 MHz PC using E-prime experimental software, 1.1
version (Schneider, Eschman & Zuccolotto, 2002). The
lists were visually displayed. Each list started with a
fixation point for 2 s, and afterwards the items were
presented for 2 s with an inter-stimulus interval of another
2 s. At the beginning of each list, participants received
instructions about how they had to study the items. After
each list, a message remained on the screen for 2 minutes,
indicating that participants had to write as many items as
they could recall from the list. After finishing this recall
phase, a new list was presented.
In the standard and complex AS study conditions
participants were instructed to start their articulations
from the onset of the fixation point indicating the
beginning of the trial, until the end of the presentation of
the items. They were asked to produce their verbalization
at their own rate through the complete list. The oral
productions were digitally recorded at a sampling rate
of 44 KHz. At the beginning of each list, participants
received four practice trials to familiarize them with
the study condition. The experiment lasted 45 minutes
approximately.

and Standard AS).  p < .05.

Results
For each participant and condition we computed the
recall accuracy (mean percentage of items correctly
recalled) and the distribution of the articulatory rate in
the articulatory suppression study conditions.

Recall accuracy
As we will discuss later, the mean rate of articulations
differed for each of the groups assessed. For this
reason, we decided to conduct analyses of covariance
(ANCOVAs) introducing the number of articulations as
covariate. The analyses revealed a significant secondorder interaction between AS condition (silent, standard
and complex), lexical status of the items (words and
pseudo-words) and group of participants (F(4,84) = 4.06,
MSE = 131.19, p < .05). To qualify this interaction
we assessed possible between-groups differences in AS
effects as a function of the lexical status of the list of
items to be studied.

Standard AS effects during the study of words
When we explored the standard AS effect (silent condition
vs. standard AS), we observed an interaction between the
AS condition and group (F(2,53) = 6.17, MSE = 101.64,
p < .05). The monolingual controls recalled more words
in the silent condition (M = 72.18, SD = 19.71) than
in the standard AS condition (M = 48.72, SD = 25.89)
(F(1,53) = 35.58, p < .05). In the group of students
of interpreting there were no differences between the
percentage of words recalled in the silent condition (M =
75.93, SD = 17.59) and in the standard AS condition (M
= 70.62, SD = 20.38) (F < 1). Similarly, the percentage
of words recalled in the silent condition (M = 78.12, SD
= 14.42) and in the standard AS condition (M = 72.26,
SD = 13.47) did not differ in the group of professional
interpreters (F(1,53) = 2.01, p > .05) (see Figure 1).

as a function of the study condition (Silent and Complex
AS).  p < .05.

Complex AS effects during the study of words
When we considered the differences between the groups
in the complex AS condition (silent condition vs. complex
AS), we obtained a significant interaction between AS
condition and group (F(2,53) = 3.09, MSE = 163.23,
p < .05). In the monolingual group there were differences
in the percentage of words correctly recalled in the silent
condition (M = 72.18, SD = 19.70) and in the complex
AS condition (M = 45.93, SD = 20.79) (F(1,53) = 30.01,
p < .05). These recall differences between the silent
(M = 75.93, SD = 17.59) and the complex AS conditions
(M = 60.62, SD = 21.74) were also found in the group
of students of interpreting (F(1,53) = 14.16, p < .05).
However, the differences between the silent condition
(M = 78.12, SD = 14.42) and the complex AS condition
(M = 71.04, SD = 15.79) did not reach significance in
the group of professional interpreters (F(1,53) = 3.37,
p > .05) (see Figure 2).
Standard AS effects during the study of pseudo-words
In the standard AS condition, the interaction between the
AS condition (silent condition and standard AS) and the
group of participants was marginally significant (F(2,53)
= 2.55, MSE = 62.16, p = .08). The monolingual controls
recalled more pseudo-words in the silent study condition
(M = 30.01, SD = 12.58) than in the standard AS
condition (M = 22.18, SD = 11.55) (F(1,53) = 12.38, p <
.05). The students of interpreting had a comparable recall
performance in the silent (M = 35.93, SD = 13.88) and
standard AS study conditions (M = 34.86, SD = 11.08)
(F < 1). Likewise, professional interpreters did not show
differences in the percentage of recalled pseudo-words
between the silent condition (M = 38.54, SD = 15.19)
and the standard AS condition (M = 34.31, SD = 15.15)
(F(1,53) = 2.22, p > .05) (see Figure 3).
Complex AS effects during the study of pseudo-words
Finally, when we examined the complex AS effect in
pseudo-words, the interaction between the AS condition
(silent condition and complex AS) and the group of
participants was not significant (F < 1). The differences

in the percentage of pseudo-words correctly recalled were

M = 30, SD = 12.59; complex AS condition: M = 20.01,
SD = 13.38, F(1,53) = 9.51, MSE = 69.89, p < .05), in
the group of interpreting students (silent condition: M =
35.93, SD = 13.88; complex AS condition: M = 30.01,
SD = 8.01, F(1,53) = 5.74, p < .05) and in the group
of professional interpreters (silent condition: M = 38.54,
SD = 15.19; complex AS condition: M = 28.58, SD =
10.79, F(1,53) = 14.44, p < .05) (see Figure 4).
In summary, the results regarding recall accuracy
indicated that the participants without training or expertise
in interpreting showed standard AS effects and complex
AS effects irrespective of the lexical status of the material
to be studied. In contrast, the students of interpreting did
not show standard AS effect with words and pseudowords, but they reduced their recall under the complex
AS study condition relative to the silent study of words
and pseudo-words. Finally, the only condition in which
professional interpreters showed AS effects was that in
which they studied pseudo-words under complex AS
conditions.
Distribution of the articulatory rate
For each participant we computed the articulatory rate in
the standard AS condition (total number of pa) and in

the complex AS condition (total number of words mesa,
silla, sillon). Afterwards, we analyzed the number of
articulations depending on whether they were produced
when the stimulus to be studied was presented on the
screen (full screen) or in the between-stimuli interval
(empty screen).
The ANOVA performed on the mean number of
articulations with AS condition (standard and complex),
lexical status of items (words and pseudo-words) and
group of participants (monolingual controls, students
and interpreters), showed a main effect of group
(F(2,53) = 23.98, MSE = 4578.01, p < .05). The group
of monolingual controls produced more articulations
(M = 157.55, SD = 34.91) than the students of interpreting
(M = 86.34, SD = 36.16) (F(1,53) = 39.36, p < .05) and
the professional interpreters (M = 94.64, SD = 29.11)
(F(1,53) = 28.46, p < .05). The number of articulations
for the groups of interpreting students and interpreters did
not differ (F < 1). The main effect of lexical status was
significant (F(1,53) = 17.34, MSE = 1277.89, p < .05).
The participants produced more articulations when they
studied pseudo-words (M = 123.48, SD = 48.83) than
when they studied words (M = 102.19, SD = 46.98).
In addition, the place in which participants produced
their articulations was significant (F(1,53) = 43.87,
MSE = 0.26, p < .05), indicating that there were more
articulations in the between-items interval (M = 2.31,
SD = 0.95) than when the items were presented on the
screen (M = 1.94, SD = 0.73). Moreover, the interaction
between place of articulation and group of participants
was significant (F(2,53) = 9.79, MSE = 0.26, p < .05).
Although all participants produced more articulations in
the between-item interval, this difference was larger in
the group of monolingual controls (F(1,53) = 56.27,
p < .05) than in the interpreting students (F(1,53) = 3.99,
p < .05) and the professional interpreters (F(1,53) = 4.14,
p < .05). None of the other main effects or interactions
approached significance (all ps > .05).
In summary, the group of monolingual controls
produced more articulations than the students of
interpreting and the professional interpreters. The
distribution of the articulation rate showed that all the
participants produced more articulations in the betweenitems interval than when a stimulus was presented on the
screen, although this difference was larger in the group of
monolingual controls.
Discussion
The present study aimed to investigate the capacity
of professional interpreters to perform concurrently
comprehension and production tasks. In simultaneous
interpreting, the professionals are continuously and
efficiently analyzing the SL and producing their
translation in the TL. Empirical evidence regarding the

Coordinating comprehension and production in interpreting
interpreters' capacity for coordinating comprehension
and production comes from studies about the AS effect
(Padilla et al., 2005). Monolingual controls reduce their
recall of words when they are asked to study words
at the time they produce irrelevant speech. However,
the recall of professional interpreters remains unaffected
by the production of irrelevant speech during the study
phase. In the current study, we explored the superiority
of interpreters in AS conditions by examining three
factors: the material to be studied, the complexity of
the articulations and the articulatory rate. In addition,
we evaluated whether the capacity of coordinating
comprehension and production in AS conditions is
modulated by the experience in interpreting. To this
end, we compared monolingual controls without training
in translation, interpreting students and professional
interpreters.
The results obtained in the experiment showed that the
recall of the monolingual controls was reduced in the AS
condition relative to the normal study condition in which
they studied items silently. The group of monolingual
controls showed AS effect regardless of the material to
be studied (words, pseudo-words) and the complexity of
the AS condition (standard or complex). The students
of interpreting showed AS effects when the difficulty
of the task increased due to the complexity of the
articulations (complex AS). Thus, they only showed AS
effects when they had to produce three real words (mesa,
silla, sillon), while their recall was unaffected by the
standard AS condition (producing pa). Finally, the only
situation in which professional interpreters showed AS
effects was when task demands were extreme (complex
AS condition during the study of pseudo-words). At first
glance, differences across groups of participants might be
explained because of the variability among them in two
factors, articulatory rate and WM capacity. In fact, the
monolingual controls produced more articulations than
the other two groups. Therefore, it could be argued that
the monolingual controls were focusing on producing their
articulations instead of memorizing the stimuli which
produced AS effects. However, the data do not support
this interpretation since the differences among the groups
were observed after controlling the rate of articulation
(covariate analyses).
In addition, it would be possible to argue that the
presence of AS effect was produced by differences
in WM capacity between the groups. However, this
suggestion can also be ruled out. First, previous studies
have shown differences between professional interpreters
and participants without training in translation even when
WM span was similar in both groups (e.g., Padilla
et al., 1995). Second, in the current study, the WM
span for the interpreting students (M = 3.94) and the
interpreters (M = 4.20) was similar (F < 1), while
they differ in the observed AS effects. Finally, in order

335

to control for the possible contribution of WM span
in the AS effects, we performed new analyses where
this variable was introduced as covariate. The pattern
of results was the same as that reported in the results
section. When participants studied words, there was a
significant interaction between standard AS condition and
group (F(2,53) = 8.11, MSE = 94.61, p < .05), which
revealed AS effect only in the group of monolingual
controls when they studied words (silent: M = 72.18,
SD = 19.71; standard: M = 48.72, SD = 25.89), and
a significant interaction between complex AS condition
and group (F(2,53) = 4.61, MSE = 166.85, p < .05),
that showed complex AS effect in monolingual controls
(silent: M = 72.18, SD = 19.71; complex: M = 45.93,
SD = 20.79) and the students (silent: M = 75.73,
SD = 17.59; complex: M = 62.49, SD = 21.74). Likewise,
when participants studied pseudo-words, an interaction
between study condition and group showed that only the
monolingual controls showed standard AS effect (F < 1)
(silent: M = 30.01, SD = 12.58; standard: M = 22.18,
SD = 11.55). However, there were complex AS effects
with pseudo-words in all groups (all ps < .05), the
monolingual controls (silent: M = 30.01, SD = 12.59;
complex: M = 20, SD = 13.38), the students group (silent:
M = 35.66, SD = 13.88; complex: M = 29.41, SD = 8.01)
and the interpreters group (silent: M = 41.66, SD = 15.19;
complex: M = 28.12, SD = 10.79). Therefore, neither the
number of articulations nor the participants' WM span can
explain the superiority of the interpreters in AS situations.
Next, we discuss the role of the three variables assessed
in the study, that is, the material to be studied, the type of
articulation and the articulatory rate.
Material to be studied
When participants studied lists of words or pseudowords at the time they produced the syllable pa (standard
AS condition), only the monolingual controls reduced
their recall accuracy relative to the condition in which
they studied words silently. This pattern of results
seems to suggest that the semantic knowledge associated
with words did not have beneficial effects on memory
since no differences were found between the recall of
words and pseudo-words in the standard AS conditions.
However, this preliminary conclusion is modulated by
the complexity of the task. When the difficulty of
the production task increased (complex AS condition),
professional interpreters did not show AS effects with
words while they reduced their recall in AS conditions
during the study of the pseudo-words. Therefore, the
results of the present study indicate that the occurrence
of AS effects depends on the type of material to be
studied. The availability of lexical-semantic information
associated with the material to be studied seems to
facilitate the reactivation of information in WM during

336

Carolina Yudes, Pedro Macizo and Teresa Bajo

the study phase (Padilla et al., 2005). It is possible that
students of interpreting and professional interpreters have
developed abilities to rapidly retrieve lexical-semantic
information from LTM to favour the maintenance of
information in WM. For example, students of interpreting
and professional interpreters have been trained in notetaking skills from lectures and readings in the SL, and this
may make them easily retrieve and maintain the contents
to be translated into the TL (Lambert, 1988).
However, the pattern of results obtained in this study
contrasts with the findings reported in previous research
about the role of lexical-semantic information on the AS
effect. Padilla et al. (2005) demonstrated that professional
translators did not show AS effects with words but
they reduced their recall in AS conditions with pseudowords. On the contrary, in the simple AS condition of
our study which was similar to the AS condition in
Padilla et al., professional interpreters did not show AS
effects regardless of the material to be studied (words or
pseudo-words). The differences between studies might be
determined by the articulatory rate imposed during AS
conditions. Following previous studies (Baddeley, 1986;
Baddeley & Larsen, 2007; Murray, 1968), the participants
in the Padilla et al.'s study were asked to produce their
articulations at a regular rate. However, in our study, the
participants produced their articulations at their own rate
and they did not distribute them uniformly, which might
have implications for the encoding of information in the
study phase (see below for further discussion).
Type of articulation
In previous studies regarding AS effects, the participants
are usually asked to produce repeatedly a syllable
with no specific meaning (e.g., the syllable pa). The
overt production of this syllable while simultaneously
memorizing words is a sufficient condition to produce
AS effects. Since this syllable has no meaning, it can
be concluded that AS effect is the result of phonological
interference during the retention of words.
In the current study we evaluated the consequences of
generating complex productions on the study of words. To
this end, standard AS conditions (the production of the syllable pa during the retention of words) was compared with
complex AS condition (the production of three real words,
mesa, silla, sillon). The pattern of results corroborates
Christoffels's (2006) study in that the negative effect of
AS on recall was larger in complex AS situations relative
to standard AS conditions. For example, the students of
interpreting that did not show standard AS effect reduced
their recall under complex AS situations. It has been
suggested that the complexity of utterances in WM tasks
increases the cognitive load so that the participants may
have reduced resources to deal with the retention of words
(Jones et al., 2004). This hypothesis is also supported by

the results obtained with professional interpreters, since
they only showed complex AS effect during the study
of pseudo-words. Consequently, these results suggest that
the interpreters could benefit from the use of semantic
information retrieved from LTM during the retention of
words, and thus they were able to reduce the cognitive
load associated with speech production. However, when
they could not benefit from this information during the
encoding of the pseudo-words, they were affected by the
simultaneous production of real words.
Unfortunately, from our data we cannot determine the
nature of the cognitive load associated to this complex
AS condition. It might be phonological since the string
of sounds to be maintained and produced (three words,
six syllables total) was larger than that in the standard
condition (one syllable). However, it is also possible that
the cognitive load in complex AS was due to the retrieval
of semantic information associated with the three words to
be produced in this condition. If that was the case, access
to semantic information in AS conditions can benefit or
hinder performance depending on the process in which
this information is used. The availability of semantic
information in the comprehension and retention of words
facilitates the recall of items (see earlier section). On
the other hand, the retrieval of semantic information for
the production of irrelevant speech in complex AS might
interfere with the study and maintenance of information
that has to be recalled later. However, this issue needs
further investigation.
In addition, the fact that professional interpreters
did not show complex AS effects when they studied
words suggests a better control of the production process
related to the experience in interpreting. Previous studies
indicate that some of the tasks involved in interpreting
become highly automatized with experience (Hirst,
Spelke, Reaves, Caharack & Neisser, 1980). Professional
interpreters shift their attention between input and output
continuously depending on the demands of the SL and
TL, so they become less prone to interference (Daro,
1989; de Groot, 2000; Gile, 1997; Moser-Mercer, 2005).
Additionally, empirical evidence indicates that, after
intensive practice, professional interpreters ignore the
sound of their voice so they can focus on processing the
input while ignoring their outputs (Daro & Fabbro, 1994;
Gerver, 1969). This shift of attention to the processing of
input while dismissing the output might explain why the
professional interpreters successfully performed the study
of words at the same time that they produced complex
articulations.
Articulatory rate
In this study participants were asked to produce their
speech at their own rate in AS conditions. The control
group produced more irrelevant speech than the other two

Coordinating comprehension and production in interpreting
groups. However, as stated previously, these differences
cannot account for the among groups variability observed
in AS. However, more interesting were the differences
in the distribution of articulations. All the participants
produced more articulations when the items to be
memorized were not presented (empty screen). However,
this asymmetry was larger in the control group than
in the group of students and professional interpreters.
That is, participants with training in interpreting balanced
their production between the input encoding (full screen)
and the maintenance of words (empty screen). This
balanced distribution of the articulations in participants
with training in interpreting seems to be related to their
skill in regulating the processing and retention of SL
during a simultaneous interpreting task (Barik, 1975;
Goldman-Eisler, 1972; Lee, 1999). For example, although
a regular speech rate in interpreting is desirable for the
audience, the interpreters' productions are rarely constant.
Thus, they wait until a meaningful unit of information has
been processed to start their production (Goldman-Eisler,
1972). Also, they delay their speech when the input is
difficult to understand (semantic-syntactic complexity;
Treisman, 1965), and they lag further behind when the
input rate increases (Barik, 1975).
The pattern of results obtained in the present study
can be accommodated within Baddeley's (1986, 2000)
WM model. In AS conditions, the rehearsal function of
the phonological loop is blocked. This blocking effect
might interfere with building an episodic structure in
the episodic buffer for retrieving words in the recall
phase (Christoffels, 2006). The articulation of meaningful
items (complex AS) might also interfere with the episodic
retention of words. However, the availability of semantic
information retrieved from LTM (the retention of words
relative to pseudo-words) might attenuate this interfering
effect in the interpreters probably because they rapidly
transfer information from the phonological loop to the
episodic buffer.
To conclude, the present study indicates that experience
in interpreting favours the development of skills that
make the interpreters successfully perform simultaneous
comprehension and production process. Thus, in an
articulatory suppression task, professional interpreters
only showed interference when they produced complex
articulations and memorized pseudo-words. These results
emphasize the role of activating semantic information
from LTM during AS tasks. The availability of
lexical-semantic information during AS tasks seems to
benefit or hinder performance depending on the balance
between the comprehension and production processes that
participants perform concurrently. Hence, the availability
of semantic information can benefit the study of words
probably by the refreshing of memory traces or by
favouring reconstruction of information in the recall
phase. However, when participants produce irrelevant

337

speech which is semantically rich, the cognitive load
associated with the articulation of the output might greatly
interfere with input enconding.
