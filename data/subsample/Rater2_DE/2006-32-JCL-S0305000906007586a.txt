ABSTRACT

The paper examines the nominal lexicon in later language acquisition
as a window on linguistic knowledge and usage across childhood and
adolescence. The paper presents a psycholinguistically motivated
and cognitively grounded analysis of the distribution of ten semantic
noun categories (the Noun Scale) across development, modality, and
genre. Eighty Hebrew-speaking children (9 ;0 to 10 ;0), adolescents
(12 ; 0 to 13 ; 0 and 16 ; 0 to 17 ; 0), and a group of adult university
graduate students participated in the study. Each produced four
different texts : a spoken and written narrative and a spoken and written
expository, yielding a total of 320 texts. All lexical noun tokens in each
of the 320 texts were analysed to determine their score on the Noun
Scale. Results indicate that nominal density, which underlies much
of the syntactic architecture of texts, increases dramatically in
adolescence, towards adulthood. The paper analyses the developmental
patterns of each of the ten Noun Scale categories, showing that the
nominal lexicon of schoolaged children is already very different from
that of young children in having only a small amount of genuinely
concrete nouns, and these too only in narrative texts. The quantitative
analysis shows that nouns grow more categorical and abstract with age

adults, native speakers of seven different languages (Berman & Verhoeven, 2002). The
broad aims of the project were to shed light on the way in which children, adolescents,
and adults construct texts - in the sense of monologic pieces of discourse; to examine the
linguistic, cognitive, and communicative resources that they deploy in adapting their
texts to different circumstances (in expository versus narrative discourse and in writing
compared with speech); and to detect shared or different trends depending on the
particular target language. Address for correspondence : Dorit Ravid, School of

and schooling, especially in adolescence. Written expository texts are
the preferred habitat of abstract, categorical nouns from early on. The
systematic qualitative analysis of noun tokens in their textual context
demonstrates how the nominal lexicon undergoes fundamental changes
that are affected by linguistic, cognitive and social development, in
interaction with text genre and modality.

INTRODUCTION

This paper examines the development of semantic categories of nouns
in ` later language development ', that is, across the school years. It is
motivated by the view that the lexicon plays a central role in language
acquisition (Dockrell & Messer, 2004 ; Ravid, 2004) for a number of
reasons. First, the lexicon is essential for development of syntax, since
syntactic constructions depend crucially on (open-class) words for content.
Second, the higher the occurrence of content words, especially nouns and
adjectives, the higher the complexity of the syntactic architecture that
frames them (Ravid, van Hell, Rosado & Zamora, 2002). Third, idiomatic
constructions held in memory include syntactic phrases and whole clauses
like the eleventh hour, it's raining cats and dogs. In fact, the syntactic texture
of mature language derives largely from the frequent occurrence of such
` prefabricated ' multilexemic units (Jackendoff, 2002). Development of
the advanced lexicon thus interacts with both syntactic complexity and
informative content.
The present study focuses on the nominal lexicon as a window on
linguistic knowledge and usage across development. Nouns underlie the
most basic building blocks of morphosyntactic structure (Anderson, 1985),
and they play an important role in constructing discourse structure
(Francis, 1986). Nouns occupy a central place in the study of adult
psycholinguistic processes (Chiarello, Liu & Shears, 2001), and of child
language development, most specifically in relation to the learning mechanisms in acquisition (Clark, 1993; Markman, 1989). Nouns thus feature
large in the mental lexicon in general and in lexical development in
particular. The examination of nouns across development offers interesting
and potentially rewarding insights into lexical acquisition.
A key premise of the study is that nominal density also reflects nominal
diversity : language users do not repeat the same noun over and over as do
infants and toddlers (Richards & Malvern, 1997). When a noun is repeated
in a text, it either serves a cohesive function which is well-established in
children over nine years of age (Berman & Slobin, 1994; Hickmann, 2003),
or else it takes on a different shade of meaning, as will be shown below.
Therefore, having more nouns in the texts of older children, adolescents

nouns and consequently a higher

Noun categories in development
Noun categories - concrete, count, individual, collective, mass, generic,
categorical and abstract - have been the focus of various developmental
studies relating to different stages of acquisition. The issue of
INDIVIDUATION is central in the debate about noun reference in early word
learning in toddlers (Golinkoff, Mervis & Hirsh-Pasek, 1994; Tomasello,
Strosberg & Akhtar, 1996). There is also a large body of research on nouns
referring to COLLECTIONS and on the MASS versus COUNT noun distinction
in young children (Bloom & Kelemen, 1995). Some of them suggest that
culture-specific input factors in maternal speech and language-specific
factors such as COUNT/MASS syntax affect children's performance
(Gathercole, Thomas & Evans, 2000; Gentner & Boroditsky, 2001).
As children grow older and mature cognitively, they amass a large
amount of real-world and school-related knowledge that enables them to
express increasingly composite concepts in abstract and complex vocabulary
(Anglin, 1993). Defining abstract nouns was found to be a difficult task for
adolescents and even for eighteen-year-olds (Nippold, Hegel, Sohlberg &
Schwarz, 1999). A range of studies examined the acquisition of abstract
and derived nominals in Hebrew. Ravid and Avidor's (1998) experimental
study in children aged 5 ; 0 to 15 ; 0 compared with adults revealed that
full mastery of derived, abstract, morphologically complex nouns emerges
as late as around puberty and consolidates only in adulthood. Seroussi's
(2004) sentence-construction task from pre-adolescence to adulthood
showed how noun production changes from concrete, literal, prototypical, and
monosemous construal and use of nouns, to abstract, metaphorical,
variegated, and polysemous.
Ravid & Cahana-Amitay's (2005) analysis of narratives in the school years
found that written texts, particularly those of adults, were richer in derived
nouns than spoken texts. With development, there was an increase in level
of abstraction and in the complexity of the syntactic contexts in which such
nouns occurred. Ravid & Zilberbuch (2003) found that, with age and
schooling, texts became richer in complex nominal structures, in particular
written expository texts. A crosslinguistic developmental study in Dutch,
English, Hebrew and Spanish texts (Ravid et al., 2002) revealed a consistent
increase in complex NPs from childhood to adulthood, again markedly
more so in written expository texts.
These studies of text-embedded use of nouns indicate that noun
categories undergo fundamental changes with age and schooling, and are
heavily dependent on text type and on contexts of production. To date,
793

however, there has been no research that systematically traces development
of noun categories in text construction. The goal of the present study is
to meet this requirement by providing a principled characterization of
developmental patterns in the distribution of text-embedded noun
categories. The current paper proposes, describes and tests the Noun Scale,
which classifies nouns into semantic-pragmatic categories in the context
of spoken and written narrative and expository texts produced by Hebrewspeaking children, adolescents, and adults.
Study variables and predictions
This study analyses the distribution of noun categories in textual context
as a window on the development of the nominal lexicon. Monologic text
construction was selected in order to examine whether and how young
language users are able to go beyond the merely correct yet decontexualized production of noun categories to deploying them appropriately
and flexibly in context (Berman & Slobin, 1994 ; Ravid & Tolchinsky, 2002).
Command of abstract and derived nouns requires considerable morphosyntactic proficiency and an extensive advanced-level vocabulary, together
with flexible and sophisticated strategies of form-meaning linkage, leading
to the prediction that texts will become increasingly nominal (that is, they
will contain more nouns), and nouns will become more categorical and more
abstract as a function of age and schooling.
The distinction between the two modalities of writing and speech is
known to foster two distinct styles of discourse. Spoken communication is
typically produced under the pressure of rapid online processing whereas
displaced time in writing allows for more planning and monitoring in offline
production (Chafe, 1994 ; Stromqvist, Nordqvist & Wengelin, 2004). In
addition, spoken language is typically more personalized and interactive,
while written language is produced in more detached, less interactive
settings and consequent linguistic encoding, including morphosyntax and
vocabulary (Biber, 1995 ; Berman, Ragnarsdottir & Stromqvist, 2002 ; Ravid
& Zilberbuch, 2003). This leads to two predictions : First, written texts
should be nominally denser than spoken texts ; and second, a larger, more
diversified, more categorical and abstract nominal vocabulary is expected in
writing than in speech (Ravid & Cahana-Amitay, 2005).
The two genres selected for this study are narratives, which focus on
people, their actions and motivations, and express the unfolding of events
in a temporal framework (Berman & Slobin, 1994 ; Hickmann, 2003) ;
and expository texts, which focus on issues and ideas, and express the
unfolding of claims and argumentation in causal and other logical contexts
(Britton, 1994 ; Katzenberger, 2004). Previous studies deriving from the
same data base as the present one in Hebrew and in other languages,
794

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS

indicate that even young children of early grade school age distinguish
clearly in linguistic expression between narrative and expository texts
(Ravid, 2004) - for example, in use of verb tense, mood, and aspect, in
forms of reference, in voice, and in lexical selection (Jisa, Reilly, Verhoeven,
Baruch & Rosado, 2002 ; Ragnarsdottir, Cahana-Amitay, van Hell, Rosado
& Viguie, 2002 ; Tolchinsky, Johansson & Zamora, 2002). It is expected
that here, too, genre will be a factor in the differential distribution of
noun categories, with narratives favoring specific, concrete, and proper
nouns, and expositories - categorical, generic, and more abstract nouns. In
addition, nouns that convey narrative-specific content (such as reference to
time and place) should be more pervasive in narrative than in expository
texts.
Data elicitation, participants, data base
The study reported here analyses texts produced by 80 Hebrew-speaking
children, adolescents, and adults of monolingual, middle-class backgrounds,
20 in each of four age-groups : children aged 9 ;0 to 10 ;0 (4th graders,
henceforth nine-year-olds) ; pre-adolescents aged 12 ;0 to 13 ;0 (7th grade
junior-high school students, henceforth twelve-year-olds) ; adolescents
aged 16 ; 0 to 17 ; 0 (11th grade high school students, henceforth sixteenyear-olds), and a group of adults aged 25 to 35 years (university graduate
students majoring in the sciences or humanities). Participants were shown
a three-minute wordless video clip depicting different conflict situations
in a school setting, involving unresolved, so non-narrative, scenes of
interpersonal conflict in a school setting - for example, a moral conflict
of whether to cheat in an exam or return a purse someone dropped, a social
conflict of how to treat a new student who interfered in a conversation, and
a physical conflict of fighting during recess. After seeing the video clip, each
participant was required to produce four texts in randomly balanced order.
They were asked to write and tell a story about an incident where they
had been involved in a situation of ` problems between people ' (a personalexperience narrative) and to write a composition and give a talk in which
they discuss the topic ` problems between people' (an expository
discussion).
This yielded a total of 320 texts, since each of the 80 subjects produced
four different texts : a spoken and written narrative and a spoken and
written expository. This methodology allowed us to control the variables
of age, genre, and modality - because the same subjects produced each
of the four texts. Moreover, these are all ` authentic ' texts elicited from
` naive' speaker-writers without any editing or revision on the part
of the investigators. And they were elicited from speaker-writers of
` standard Hebrew' - non-specialists in language and non-experts in writing

(excluding, for example, teachers, lecturers, journalists, authors) but welleducated and ` mainstream ' in social class and literacy background.
Analysis
Discourse-sensitive analysis of the lexical composition of texts requires
that the functions and roles of words be considered in context, to ensure
methodologically valid decisions. My assumption is that a noun lemma or
TYPE is a coarse-grained entity encapsulating a cluster of interwoven
meanings, each finding expression in different contexts. At the same time,
each noun TOKEN conveys fine-grained semantic-pragmatic quanta dictated
by its syntactic and discursive context. For example, Hebrew mivxanim `tests,
exams ' might convey an imageable meaning in the context of a teacher
handing out test papers, a more abstract meaning in the context of the term
end-of-year exams, and a highly abstract meaning in referring to life's
trials and tribulations. Since my major interest is in the actual deployment
and use of each and every noun occurrence in textual context, the analyses
presented in this study are based on noun TOKENS rather than TYPES.
All the lexical noun tokens (that is, excluding pronouns such as him,
myself ) in each of the 320 texts were identified and counted. Since nouns
carry a major part of the referential information in the text, the nominal
density of each text was calculated as a mean number of nouns per
clause - the basic unit of syntactic and prepositional analysis in this as in
other crosslinguistic studies (Berman & Slobin, 1994 : 660-3 ; Berman &
Verhoeven, 2002 : 11) to neutralize different text lengths. Each noun was
then assigned a category on the proposed Noun Scale (below), taking into
account its syntactic and discourse contexts, as noted above and elaborated
below. All analyses were conducted by three native-speakers of Hebrew
with training in linguistics, with inter-judge reliability reaching 91 %, and
disputes settled by discussion.
The Noun Scale
The Noun Scale described below is a means of ranking and classifying
nouns in their textual context from two points of view. As a RANKING tool,
it assigns nouns a score of 1-10 on a scale of 10, going from first to thirdorder nominals, with individuated, concrete nouns at the lower levels and
increasing categoriality and abstractness at the higher levels. At the same
time, the Noun Scale is also a CLASSIFYING tool, since it categorizes nouns
by their semantic-pragmatic content as related to text topic and genre.
From this perspective, ranking is less important than classification by
content. Thus ranks on the Scale are referred to below as either LEVELS or
CATEGORIES, depending on the context of analysis. This section defines the
levels/categories constituting the proposed Noun Scale, with examples for
796

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS

each level, either translated from the Hebrew database or taken from the
English database of the crosslinguistic project (see note 2).
Level 1. Concrete nouns. This level includes only genuinely concrete,
mostly count nouns1 such as back-pack, ball, bike, doors, jar, ruler, folder ;
as well as nouns designating specific persons in the text, such as a boy (from
my class). Note that the same noun label can occupy different levels on the
Scale, since the same word kids comes up again at Level 5.
Level 2. Proper names. This level includes proper nouns designating
individuals e.g. Racheli, Shany, Tiffany. The first two levels roughly
correspond to Lyons' (1977) first-order nominals referring to stable physical
entities - persons, animals, and things.
Level 3. Collective/Location [reference group] nouns. This category
expresses The intrinsic relationship between locations and collective nouns
bounded within a given location (Langacker, 1991). Consider the inherent
ambiguity of a word like library, as designating both a place where books
are held and a collection of books. In the same vein, if a Hebrew-speaking
ten-year-old says ` I went out to play soccer with the neighbourhood ', it is clear
that he is referring to the collection of children in his neighbourhood. Level
3 thus includes nouns such as army, business, camp, class, city, club, family,
kibbutz, orchestra, school. Note that in the context of the clause Yesterday,
a kid from 6th grade hit me, 6th grade is a reference group noun ; but see
Level 6 below for the same term with a temporal designation. Level 3 also
contains rarer, lexically-specific reference group nouns belonging to a
higher register, where the term ` register ' is used in the sense of ` the
linguistic differences that correlate with different occasions of use '
(Ferguson, 1994, p. 16). For example, administration, background, community, cult, environment, generation, government, institute, population, system
are all location/reference group nouns on a higher level of linguistic register
than, say, home or school.
Level 4. Role nouns. This is a category of nouns referring to people via
their social roles. The idea here is that there is a difference in degree of
abstractness and categoriality between genuine concrete nouns such as
glass or even man, on the one hand, and nouns that denote people's roles in
relation to other individuals or to institutions, such as, cousin, counselor, class
queen, neighbour or pupil. I regard role nouns as both removed semantically
from the concrete sense and also less specific and individuated than nouns
at Levels 1 and 2. Examples from the texts include roles such as mother,
father, brother and teacher, but also coach, date, driver, guide, non-boarder,
principal, parents, room-mate, soldier, step-dad, wife. This level also included
high-register, lexically specific role nouns, e.g. chiropractor, co-worker, dean,
employer, member, musicians, rival, partner, peer, pole-vaulter, team-head.
[1] Examples are all taken from the Hebrew texts and presented in English translation.

Together, Levels 3 and 4 refer to two of the most conspicuous entities in
our database, which, to recall, concerned personal experience stories and
expository discussions of the shared, socially relevant topic of interpersonal
conflict : people with social roles and their reference groups. Together
with Level 5 they constitute the transition between Levels 1-2 first-order
individuated nominals to second-order entities.
Level 5. Generic nouns. Level 5 contains generic nouns which refer
to people and things in general (Foley & Van Valin, 1985). The role of
syntactic context and temporal reference is crucial here, since a noun such
as kids may refer to specific children (the kids in my class) and so receive the
rank of 1, but it may also refer to kids in general, and so receive the rank of
5 (e.g. kids don't like to get a lot of homework). This is also the only category
where indefinite pronouns like nobody or something - that is non-lexical
pronominals - were included on the Scale. Examples of Level 5 are lexical
nouns such as boys, individuals, people, stuff, things ; as well as pronominals
such as each other, everybody, nobody, somebody, something.
The next three levels - 6, 7 and 8 - are based on Lyons' (1977) secondorder entities, and refer to observable events, processes, or states of affairs
that take place in time.
Level 6. Temporal nouns. Nouns designating temporal units (e.g. minute,
hour, month) have long posed problems for nominal analysis (Lyons, 1977).
Are these ` real ' nouns ? Do they designate nominal or adverbial meaning?
The Noun Scale enables us to pull out all these nouns irrespective of
their syntactic context, which was often prepositional in structure and
calendrical in content, and include them in this analysis, e.g. (for a) week,
(half a) year (ago), (one) day, (two) months, (a certain) hour, (those) seconds,
(all that) night, (in that) season. In addition, as noted earlier, nouns which
are not prima facie temporal in reference but that occur in a context that
elicits a temporal interpretation were also assigned to this level, e.g. 6th
grade, as in when I was in 6th grade _ '.
Level 7. Event nouns. This is the least abstract and most `imageable ' of
the four highest levels on the Noun Scale. It designates event nouns such
as battle, cases, class (i.e., lesson), events, game, lunch, party, quiz, session,
triathlon, therapy, which refer to events with a duration, in contexts such
as story (is over), (during the) movie, (play) soccer, (go to a) show. It is no
accident that event nouns follow temporal nouns on the Noun Scale: they
are related, with temporal nouns serving as the bridge to the higher level of
` less strictly nominal ' abstractness. In case the noun is ambiguous between
temporals and events, the error in assigning category is not that great.
Level 8. Imageable abstract nouns. These are abstract yet observable
and imageable nouns (Nitto, Suehiro & Hori, 2002) such as exam in the
sense of the exam paper. Examples include blows, kicks, scratch, yells, as well
as other cases where nouns were contexualized, imageable, less abstract, as

in (I whispered the) answers. Also included here are all abstract nouns
appearing in the context of lexicalized and metaphorical expressions such
as the road to peace. This made it possible to include every nominal in the
text in my analysis, even ones that occur in frozen prefabricated expressions
such as (blow something out of ) proportion, (broadcast on the same) wavelength, (gets his) kicks, (in a negative) manner, (keep under) control, (no) choice,
(on) purpose, (reach a) conclusion, (totally off their) rocker.
Finally, Lyons' third-order entities, the most abstract and least
individuated nouns which lie outside space and time, appear here as levels
9 and 10.
Level 9. Abstract nouns. These are genuinely abstract, non-imageable, in
many cases non-individuated nouns (Langacker, 1991) such as authority,
career, challenge, character, dignity, dimensions, discipline, emotion, fatigue,
feedback, harmony, issue, joy, opinion, plans, pride, pneumonia, power, relationship, religion, respect, theories, topic, sign, source, standard, style.
Level 10. Derived abstract nominals. Here is the only place on the Noun
Scale where morphological structure is taken into account in addition
to semantics. These are abstract nouns derived from verbs, adjectives
and other nouns. Examples include annoyance, behavior, communication,
confrontation, discussion, ease, intervention, negativity, prejudgments, pressure,
separation, supervision, tolerance, unpleasantness.

A second analysis assigned each text a score on the Noun Scale averaged
from all noun scores in the text. In this case, high-register nouns from
categories 3-5 (e.g. administration, rival) were re-coded as level 9 (Table 2).

different subsets (Scheffe) : The 9 ; 0 to 10 ; 0 group, the 12 ;0 to 13 ; 0
and 16 ; 0 to 17 ; 0 groups, and adults ; modality (F(1, 75)=10.04,
p<0.003) - written texts have a higher score than spoken texts ; and genre
(F(1, 75)=117.82, p<0.0001) - expository texts have a higher score than
narratives. One interaction of modalityrgenre (F(1, 75)=8.25, p<0.006)
mitigated these simple effects (Figure 3). The Bonferroni Test showed that
801

spoken and written narrative texts had the same score, whereas the written
expositories had the highest score of all other text types.
Distribution of noun categories : age, modality, genre
Consider, next, the percentage distribution of the ten Noun Scale levels
(termed here categories) out of all nouns across the three study variables
(Table 3).
Separate 3-way analyses (agermodalityrgenre) were conducted on each
of the categories, with further post hoc Scheffe and Bonferroni tests.
Category 1. Concrete nouns and specific persons : genre (F(1, 75)=44.9,
p<0.0001) - narratives have more Category 1 nouns than do expositories.
Category 2. Proper names : genre (F(1, 75)=9.17, p<0.004) - narratives
have more proper names than expositories. Category 3. Reference group
nouns : age (F(3, 75)=5.06, p<0.004) - the sixteen-year-olds have the most
Category 3 nouns ; genre (F(1, 75)=12.92, p<0.002) : Narratives have
more reference group nouns than expositories. Category 4. Role nouns :
genre (F(1, 75)=46.86, p<0.0001) - narratives have more role nouns
than do expositories. Category 5. Generic nouns : age (F(3, 75)=9.93,
p<0.0001) - generics decline with age and schooling, most in the nineyear-olds ; modality (F(1,75)=5.26, p<0.03) - spoken texts have more
generic nouns than do written texts ; genre (F(1,75)=95.43, p<0.0001) -
expositories have more generic nouns than do narratives, but (see Figure 4,
Interaction agergenre (F(3, 75)=11.79, p<0.0001) only in the two
younger groups, and expositories by nine-year-olds contain the highest
proportion of generic nouns.
Category 6. Temporal nouns : age (F(3, 75)=4.16, p<0.01) - twelveyear-olds have the most temporal nouns, adults the fewest; genre
(F(1,75)=83.32, p<0.0001) - narratives contain more temporal nouns than
do expositories, but (interaction agergenre (F(3, 75)=2.97, p<0.04),
Figure 5) only in the two younger groups ; narratives by twelve-year-olds
have the most temporal nouns.
Category 7. Event nouns : genre (F(1, 75)=11.04, p<0.002) - narratives
have more event nouns than do expositories. Category 8. Imageable
abstract nouns : genre (F(1, 75)=22.83, p<0.0001) - expositories have more
imageable abstract nouns than do narratives. Category 9. Abstract
nouns : age (F(3, 75)=16.16, p<0.0001) - abstract nouns increase with age
and schooling, especially from age 12 ; 0 to 16 ;0 ; genre (F(1, 75)=21.83,
p<0.0001) - expositories have more abstract nouns than do narratives.
Category 10. Derived abstract nouns : age (F(3, 75)=11.85, p<0.0001) -
derived abstract nouns increase with age and schooling, in three
different subsets - the two younger groups, the sixteen-year-olds,
and the adults ; modality (F(1, 75)=8.01, p<0.007) - written texts have

Genre-specific distribution of categories
A final analysis was conducted to see the differential size of the Noun
Scale categories in narratives versus expositories beyond development.
Genre emerged as a simple effect in all ten categories, while modality was
significant in only two, and interacted with other variables in another
two. I therefore averaged the percentages of the same category in the two
modalities in each genre (Table 4, a - narrative, b - expository), with a

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS
DISCUSSION

Below I discuss the quantitative results of the study and present a
qualitative analysis of the ten Noun Scale categories.
Nominal density and score on the scale
Two preliminary analyses assessed the combined role of development,
modality, and genre in the occurrence of nouns in the texts. One analysis
revealed that NOMINAL DENSITY, which underlies much of the referential
and syntactic architecture of texts (Halliday, 1989 ; Biber, 1995 ; Ravid,
2004), increases dramatically in adolescence, towards adulthood. The rich
syntactic structure that is typical of adult texts thus consolidates very late
in terms of language acquisition, around 16 ; 0 to 18 ; 0, and is highly
dependent on the combined effect of literacy and socio-cognitive factors
(Nippold, 1998 ; Ravid & Zilberbuch, 2003). Across this study, genre
emerges as a stronger diagnostic than modality, a finding which is consistent
with results of analyses of other linguistic and discursive features of the
same data base in different languages (e.g. Berman & Verhoeven, 2002 ;
Berman & Nir-Sagiv, 2004). Written texts are nominally denser than
spoken texts only in the older groups, and especially in the adults. Only
written adult texts contain chains of nouns and consequently large chunks
of long and complex, inter- and intra-related NPs and PPs serving a variety
of syntactic functions and hosting relative clauses, the most cognitively
challenging subordination type (Ong, 1992). In younger age groups, both
spoken and written texts are nominally ` light ' and consequently contain
shorter and less complex nominal structures, which are easier to process
(Halliday, 1989; Chafe, 1994 ; Ravid et al., 2002). But across all age groups,
expository texts are nominally denser than narratives, and hence more
complex linguistically and informatively richer. And as found in Ravid
(2004), written expositories are nominally denser than all other text types.
This finding is consistent across all the analyses conducted in the present
study.
Against this background, we now turn to the Noun Scale itself. An
analysis of the average Noun score across the texts revealed a gradual
increase in the degree of categoriality and abstractness of the text, with
cutoff points towards and again after adolescence. The noun score was
highly diagnostic across all four text types in combination with development : written texts, taking a detached stance and with a higher lexical and
syntactic density, have a higher score than spoken texts, which are typically
more personalized and interactive. Expository texts, concerned with
abstract, general issues, score higher on the Scale than personal-experience
narratives, which focus on people participating in events. In all four age
groups (except for narratives in the adolescent groups), the noun score
809

DORIT RAVID

has the following ascending order : spoken narrativespwritten narrativesp
spoken expositoriespwritten expositories. Written expositories have the
highest noun score of all four text types. The scores within each age group
illustrate this robust finding, rising not only with age and schooling but
also within each group across text types (Table 2). This foreshadows one
of the main findings of this paper - the fact that counter to popular
thought, even spoken personal narratives by nine-year-olds make sparse
use of genuinely individuated, concrete nouns (1-2 on the scale) ; instead,
they recruit general, categorical nouns with appropriate modulations for
genre and modality in their text production. True, this finding is limited to
the discourse types investigated in this study and does not cover spoken
conversation (which contains few lexical nouns, see Chafe, 1994). But the
fact that each of the participants produced four different texts in two
modalities and two genres does provide us with sufficient data on language
variation to support these conclusions.

GENRE, DEVELOPMENT AND MODALITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION
OF NOUN CATEGORIES

Of the three study variables, the distribution of noun categories is most
deeply intertwined with text genre : genre was statistically significant in
every single category (including the high-register analysis), in contrast to
modality, which featured only in generics and derived abstracts. Age was
significant in only half of the categories - reference group, generic nouns,
temporal, abstract, and derived abstract nouns. The discussion will thus
focus on the important role of genre in the development of the nominal
lexicon, highlighting the factor of modality at specific sites.
Concrete nouns and proper names
On the whole, the database contains few genuine `first-order ' sortals -
concrete nouns denoting count, ` bounded ', physical objects of the type
discussed in Langacker (1991) and Lyons (1977) - typically expressed by
categories 1 and 2 on the Noun Scale. One reason that comes to mind is the
topic of the texts elicited in this study - interpersonal conflict, which focuses
on people rather than concrete objects. As I show throughout the category
analysis, monologic texts elicit the production of higher-order nominals
from early on.
Only narratives contain 1-2 nouns : averaged across populations, concrete
nouns and proper names constitute just under 10 % of the nouns in narratives,
and are among the less frequent narrative categories. Expositories contain
a negligible number of these categories (Table 4). This distribution is a
reflection of the different DISCOURSE STANCE of genres (Berman et al.,
810

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS

2002) : Personal-experience narratives are specific and anchored in real
time and space, referring to individuals and objects, while expositories are
concerned with general, categorical, abstract issues and refer marginally if
at all to sortals. Regarding development, the interesting finding is children's
early ability to discern the preferred habitat of categories 1-2 nouns and
to demarcate narratives from expositories in their use of nouns. Thus
there are very few sortals in expositories by nine-year-olds and practically
none in the older age groups. Yet, interestingly, even children's narratives
contain a surprisingly low number of concrete, individuated entities. Most
reference to individual people across the narratives, especially from twelve
years of age onwards, uses the more distanced and less individuated labels
provided by role nouns (see 4.2.2 below).
A qualitative analysis of 1-2 nouns in the narratives reveals the interaction of development with social, cognitive, and literacy-related factors.
Most narratives by younger participants relate quite uniform personalexperience conflicts : the narrator as protagonist, either victim or abuser, in
dynamic peer-group conflicts in a school setting. Concurrently, 1-2 nouns
usually refer to individual classroom peers in terms of `a boy/girl from my
class'. When peers' given names are used, young narrators designate
their relationship to the narrator as part of the attendant circumstances.
Thus for example, a nine-year-old boy writes There was a boy who had been
targeted before me, his name was Dima.
Narratives by sixteen-year-olds are a mixed bag : some resemble stories
by twelve-year-olds, others consist of general commentary on the topic
` conflicts between people'. Several narratives focus on the group as a
whole (e.g. how the children's community was disrupted by a newcomer). A
small number of narratives about non-dynamic inter-personal conflicts are
precursors of adult stories (e.g. agonizing whether to tell about theft from
the kibbutz grocery). The impact of peer-group pressure is evident in
the narratives by sixteen-year-olds, which are less personal and face away
from the narrator - either by focusing on the peer group or by highlighting
outlier individuals. As a result, there is not a single mention of a given
name, and most individuals are designated by role labels. Adult narratives
present an interesting dichotomy : many of them do not contain any 1-2
nouns, reflecting the more abstract and categorical nature of adult personal
narratives ; but on the other hand, adults, unlike adolescents, are willing
to express their feelings as individuals, with a number of detailed personal
stories of conflicts in family, community, and work settings and with
specific mention of people's given names. Adults' cognitive and rhetorical
flexibility is apparent in their ability to present the same noun as both a
concrete object (he found my personal diary) and as an imageable process
noun (I conducted a personal diary). Adults alone are able to present specific
figures in stylized categorical terms, for example, a man describing fighting
811

DORIT RAVID

with both his wife and his neighbour in terms of a classic triangle. And again
only adults insert short narrative-like passages inside their expository texts
to illustrate their general point, thereby introducing the only reference
to specific people and concrete objects (e.g. a student's schoolbag) in the
expository sample as a whole.
Role and reference group (location/collective) nouns
and REFERENCE GROUP nouns (RRGns, categories 3-4) occupy a
considerable part of the nominal inventory analysed. The instructions
focusing on ` problems between people' might be responsible for the
frequent occurrence of the role noun friend(s) and the school location, but
they alone cannot explain the rich findings described below.
Genre crucially affected the distribution of RRGns. Age featured only in
reference group nouns, which peaked in high school, a time when peer
group impact on adolescents is at its strongest, but it did not affect the
distribution of role nouns. Modality did not feature at all in either category,
except for the high-register nouns. My interpretation is that RRGns are
inherent components of both personal-experience narrative content and
expository discourse concerning social issues, in ways that override mode
of production. Above and beyond their differential statistical distribution,
the functions and levels of abstractness of RRGns in the two text types were
completely different even when the same nouns were used.
RRGns in narratives. These were the two most frequent noun categories
in the narratives, constituting together over a third of all nouns (Table 4).
Together they provide two indispensable pieces of narrative information
about participants and location (Berman & Slobin, 1994 ; Hickmann,
2003). Even in the youngest group, role nouns were the preferred mode of
reference to specific participants in narratives, labeling people through the
external, less individuated layer of their categorical social roles (counsellor,
classmate, teacher) within the context of the social institutions (family,
school) where these roles are typically enacted - rather than as specific
individuals at the more concrete 1-2 levels. But beyond that, the
distribution of RRGns in children's narratives critically differed from that
of adolescents and adults in two respects. First, there was a growth in
sheer number of different roles and reference groups. The two younger age
groups shared a small number (5-6) of roles among them. In contrast, older
groups referred to many more (20-40) different roles and locations.
A second interesting change was in actual noun CONTENT, reflecting
linguistic and cognitive growth coupled with increasing life experience.
Roles in the younger groups were largely members of the child's family
(cousin, mother) or school life. It was only in the sixteen-year-old group
and even more so in the adult group that role nouns diversified to include
ROLE

812

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS

an array of agent nouns (assembler, bouncers, conscripts, kibbutznik, marketing
director, musicians, remedial teacher, junior engineer, supervisor, workmate),
lexically specific and categorical kinship terms (family member, sister in law)
and people with specific attributes (aggressive type, extraordinary girl,
victim). This proliferation of advanced-vocabulary role nouns in the
adult narratives shows up in the statistical analysis of high-register nouns
(Table 5 and Figure 8), and is the only analysis in this category which is
affected by modality : high-register role nouns mostly appear in written
texts.
Reference group nouns in the nine- and twelve-year-olds were framed by
school or home. Stories were repeatedly anchored in the same concrete,
narrator-oriented locations, usually labeled in lexically general yet definite
noun, taking addressee's familiarity with them for granted (the classroom,
the sports yard). Few collective nouns (camps) were identified with reference
groups. In contrast, narratives by older groups referred to an array of
lexically specified locations (club, chemistry lab, communal lavatory) or to
abstract geographic entities requiring a top-down perspective and general
world knowledge (Holland, south part of village, Tel Aviv-center zone).
Many collective categories populated the narratives of older groups (dance
group, orchestra, society), with diverse lexical labels for groups (peer group,
staff, team, trio) relating role to reference group (members of ad-hoc group).
This diversity is reflected in the increase of reference group nouns in high
school. Older narratives contained dual reference to the same entity as both
a collective noun and a location ( furniture company, office). As one adult put
it my workplace generally consists of sympathetic and friendly people.
RRGns in expositories. Despite the thematic coherence in data elicitation,
entailed by the same video clip trigger and by the use of `problems between
people' in the instructions for eliciting both narrative and expository texts,
RRGns differed crucially across the two text types. First, averaged across
age groups, they occurred half as frequently in expository compared with
narrative texts (Table 4), with middle frequency in expositories, preceded
by generic and abstract nouns. In general, role and reference group
nouns in expositories are abstract and categorical even in the youngest age
group. They interact with other constructions expressing detached stance
in this genre, such as complex syntax, passive voice, nominalizations and
denominal adjectives, impersonal pronouns, irrealis and non-finite constructions (Berman & Nir-Sagiv, 2004; Ravid, 2004).
Role nouns not only occupy a smaller part of the two categories in the
expositories, but also demonstrate a striking qualitative difference. Almost
every role noun in narratives stands for a specific person. Role nouns constitute the preferred mode of referring to story participants, anchoring them
to their reference groups through their roles and thus identifying them in
the unfolding of events. But in all age groups, expository role nouns are
813

DORIT RAVID
NON-PERSONAL IN REFERENCE,

designating categories of people with distinct
social labels by either the categorical plural or the generic singular form.
Thus teacher or friend in expository texts does not refer to any specific
person but to a generic teacher or friend or the class of teachers or friends.
In line with their categorical, non-personal status, expository role nouns are
embedded in irrealis contexts (Reilly, Jisa, Baruch & Berman, 2002).
For example, kids' parents might be friends too (nine-year-olds) ; it may be
the case that the victim is a kid who has no friends for various reasons (twelveyear-olds) ; it's not the kids who are to blame but rather their educator
(sixteen-year-olds) ; many employers regard the workplace as more than a
place where one makes a living (adults). In fact, role nouns in expositories
are very close to generic nouns (see 4.2.3 below). In terms of Langacker's
(1991 : 62) notion of ` grain' or ` resolution ', what distinguishes role from
generic nouns in expository texts is the size and the specificity of the set.
Both are generic in reference, but role nouns distinguish finer and more
specific and variegated sets than do generic nouns.
Role nouns increase in number and diversity in expositories with age
and schooling in much the same way as in narratives. But there are two
important differences. First, high-register role nouns occur in expository
texts early on, e.g. new immigrant and victim. Even the ubiquitous friend
takes on an impersonal, categorial flavour in statements such as we might lose
a good friend. But expositories by nine- and twelve-year-olds revolve around
familiar, concrete roles in hypothetical yet imageable situations (a new boy
coming to class, children picking on a classmate), while role nouns in the
older groups are embedded in the generalized context of society as a whole.
They also label less familiar roles that involve experience with social
and political issues, such as Talmudic scholars, employees, philosophers, and
psychologists, or abstract roles such as parties or sides which come close
to constituting categories themselves. Second, adolescents and adult
expositories markedly prefer to refer to categorical social and affective roles
by the high-register conversion of nouns into adjectives (cf. English the
poor) as in the jealous (one) and the hating (one), the different (one) and the
stranger, the elderly, the secular, the Ultra-orthodox.
Reference group nouns designating places and collective entities (orchestra,
society) constitute a larger category in expositories. In the same way that
role nouns are typical of narratives, reference group nouns are the backbone
of expository texts dealing with social issues of the type elicited in this
study. Reference group nouns in the nine- and twelve-year-olds are the
familiar though non-specific and hypothetical settings of the school, the
home, concrete locations such as jail, the generalized country or world, and
generic every place. In the older groups, reference group nouns are abstract,
collective, yet lexically specific entities such as the environment, the human
race, the media, the parliament, the system. Sixteen-year-olds and adults
814

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS

make explicit use of collective categories such as generation or department in
discussing social issues. And only adults connect role and group reference
categories together to indicate their inherent relationship, e.g. The worker's
ability to integrate into the existing workers' community and contribute to it.
In sum, the qualitative analyses show that RRGns are the privileged
modes of reference to narrative participants and expository categories
respectively. In fact, RRGns straddle the boundary between Lyon's first
and second-order entities by designating both physical and individuated as
well as abstract and categorical entities - so that the line separating first
and second-order entities is actually permeable. Adequate linguistic and
meta-cognitive knowledge about RRGns emerges around 9 ;0, so that all
groups in this study employ them appropriately in their texts. The main
developmental changes are in degree of categoriality and abstractness, on
the one hand, and lexical specificity, on the other.
Generic nouns
Recall that generic nouns refer to people and things in general (Foley &
Van Valin, 1985). In this study, the category also included pronominals
such as each other or somebody. Generic nouns, with non-personal, nonindividuated referents such as people, constituted the largest category in
expository texts (Table 4), in line with the general, categorical stance
of expository discourse. They were especially favored in younger-age
expositories (half of the nouns in the expositories by nine-year-olds and a
third of those in twelve-year-olds were generic) as a bridge to abstractness
and categoriality. Generic nouns form large, low-resolution classes with
highly general and impersonal, non-lexically specific reference (adults, girls,
human beings) rendering them both easily accessible to children and easily
retrievable in real time in the spoken mode. They thus serve as an interim,
almost semantically empty means of conveying abstract, categorical content
in the absence of more mature morphological and lexical devices. Yet even
here, high-register generic nouns (e.g. avizarim `articles') occur only in
written expositories.
Generic nouns highlight the developmental route of embedding
expository-like commentary in narratives. Narratives in nine-year-olds
used somebody to refer to specific peers outside the narrator's personal circle
of friends, and a single twelve-year-old observes in the middle of her story
about ostracizing a classmate that since this was 2nd grade and boys were
yucky _ she had no friends. But some sixteen-year-olds, whose narratives
were less personal than those of the other groups, embedded generic nouns
in expository-like commentary in their stories, e.g. when I arrived at the
[educational ] institute as a non-boarder I was not accepted, since the group
in the institute is a closed community which finds it hard to accept somebody
815

DORIT RAVID

new. It was only the adults who wove generic nouns into the exposition to
their narratives, e.g. there are many cases of disappointment from people's
behavior around you.
Temporal and event nouns
The next two categories on the Scale, levels 6 and 7, refer to second-order
entities designated by semi-abstract nouns which occur or take place in
time - temporal and event nouns. Both categories occur more frequently in
narratives, which describe how events unfold in time, than in expositories,
which are far less dynamic, and the difference is more pronounced in
the twelve-year-olds. Again, a qualitative analysis reveals interesting
developmental patterns in interaction with genre in both categories, which
serve different though related functions.
Temporal nouns anchor narrative events on the (usually past-tense)
story-time axis, marking the difference between age groups in their
distribution and functions along this axis. A single temporal noun in the
youngest narratives marks the triggering event (on Tuesday a boy from my
class broke somebody's arms) or demarcates the length of the fight (we made
up after one day), taking either an immediate deictic perspective on time or
relating events in direct chronological sequence. In young adolescence,
several temporal points designating more complex relationships are marked
as events unfold. They anchor the narrative to the narrator's personal
timeline, frequently using grade as a temporal noun, e.g. when I was in
eighth grade, sometimes adding temporal commentary linking personal
timeline to general time, e.g. last year (in 6th grade). By adolescence,
narratives take a wider, more abstract temporal perspective by enclosing
events in a temporal chunk within which events are marked in sequence,
e.g. about six months ago, after a couple of weeks, approximately in the middle
of the year. Older narrators mark multiple points and stretches of time -
before and after a high point, e.g. we did not speak to that boy for almost
3 years, but eventually we made up; three years between 7th and 9th grade.
Older narrators treat time more objectively, e.g. in 1993 I flew to Holland
(adult) ; and they take the addressee's viewpoint into consideration, e.g.
when I was in 5th grade, if I remember correctly (sixteen-year-old). The
relative nature of time reference thus provides more mature narrators with
multiple viewpoints which are entirely lacking in younger ones.
Event nouns, referring to events with duration, usually constitute the
temporal background to narratives. Younger narratives provide limited
settings encoded by event nouns, e.g. game, movie, trip, but from the very
start the narrative is referred to in general terms as a story with duration -
this story was over (nine-year-old). As in other categories, age and schooling
bring a diversification of event nouns to battle, lecture, meeting, outing,
816

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS

wedding embedded in complex syntactic constructions with verbs and
prepositions denoting duration, for example, the war took place, throughout
that visit, our conversation ended. Finally, older narrators assign innovative
event semantics to non-temporal nominals, e.g. such an interesting triangle
in which I participated took place a couple of years ago.
Expositories are of course not as dynamic as narratives, and are
consequently short on temporals, except for habitual aspect, e.g. every day,
all the time. But they do refer to abstract temporal units such as years
and time and also to non-specific, general event nouns such as journey and
life when discussing social and moral issues.
Abstract nouns
The abstract noun categories (levels 8-10), expressing ideas, concepts,
processes and states, consisted of the following : (i) imageable abstract
nouns (including lexicalized metaphorical expressions) (hold a) rehearsal) ;
(ii) abstract nouns (discipline, values) ; and (iii) derived abstract nominals
(intervention, loitering). All abstract categories were more frequent in
expositories than in narratives. Together they made up about 50% of the
expository nominals, the three most frequent categories in expositories
after generic nouns. But narratives too contained over 25 % abstract nouns -
though RRGns were more frequent, and levels 9-10 were relatively rarer.
The higher the degree of abstractness and categoriality of nouns, the more
diagnostic they were of the study variables : imageable abstract nouns (level
8) only distinguish expositories from narratives ; abstract nouns (level 9)
also increase with age and schooling, especially from 12 ;0 to 16 ;0 ; and
derived abstract nominals (level 10), in addition, are most numerous in the
written expository texts of adults.
The analysis of abstract nominals (ANs) in the context of text production
affords a window on children's cognitive, conceptual, and linguistic
development, and complements the analyses of the other categories on the
Noun Scale. Nine-year-olds hardly use any ANs except for a number of
highly lexicalized, imageable, and high-frequency nouns like have an illness
and tell secrets in expositories. This emergent difference between text
genres is more apparent in twelve-year-olds, where narratives contain some
lexicalized or imageable nominals (no idea, assignments, scratches), with a few
ANs such as argument, friendship and threats. But expositories by twelveyear-olds are already rich in level 8 imageable or lexicalized ANs such as no
choice, lack of understanding of the material for the exam, what is the point in
being somebody's friend. They also contain more diverse ANs reflecting
a broader range of concepts, e.g. cause, education, force, language, loyalty,
relationship, strike, theft. As found in previous context-embedded analyses
of nominalizations (Seroussi, 2004 ; Ravid & Cahana-Amitay, 2005), young
817

DORIT RAVID

adolescents may produce abstract nominals in syntactically ill-formed or
infelicitous NPs, e.g. self will, to take easy methods, or else morphologically
appropriate yet lexically deviant nominals, e.g. solving instead of solution,
learning for teaching. And as found before, abstract nouns are often
pluralized to detract from their abstractness and generality, e.g. blows,
curses, copyings, fightings, penalties (Ravid & Avidor, 1998).
Adolescence and adulthood bring about a dramatic increase in the
number, content, and diversity of ANs as well as a marked preference for
using them in written texts. As noted, narratives in sixteen-year-olds are
less specific and reveal few intimate details about their narrators, resulting
in more detached and distant discourse stance. Concomitantly, they contain
a range of abstract nouns embedded in complex syntactic constructions.
Examples include a gesture of disgust, competitive tension, a certain amount of
jealousy, the hatred between the two groups. Most adults are able to weave
derived and abstract nominals skillfully into their narratives where younger
narrators would use verbs and adjectives. For example, in a teacher's
story about a conflict with a disobedient pupil : At first I did not let his
frequent interruptions disturb me, but with time it became simply impossible to
concentrate when Paul's calls and comments echo in class _ he demonstrated
the devouring of that insect. Many adult and some adolescent narratives
contain expository-like commentary characterized by ANs - again
embedded in complex syntactic constructions - e.g. the classical case is
some deep offense whose origin is in a discrepancy in expectations. But adults
are also able to talk and write about highly emotional scenes in terms of
abstract and metaphorical concepts and processes. For example, a man tells
of a domestic fight I had to take a bold decision _ getting an immediate heart
attack due to escalating, anger-induced blood pressure, or being in danger of a
multi-level controversy with my wife ; and he advocates avoidance of a direct
stare into the eyes of the adversary when in danger, a speedy flight from direct
conflict, and a growth of thick elephantine skin [sic]. This tendency to deploy
ANs instead of verbs and adjectives gives adult narratives - especially those
in the written mode - their abstract flavour, despite the intimate character
of the stories (Ravid & Cahana-Amitay, 2005).
Expository texts of adolescents, and especially those of adults, carry the
signature of abstract, categorical thought. They discuss a variety of issues
with social and moral import, from politics and reckless driving to matters
of war and peace, clashes within Israeli society, views on educational policy
and literacy instruction, and, from a more general perspective, deliberations
on relationships between social groups, perspectives on individuals' conduct
in society and philosophical discussions of moral controversy. This focus on
concepts, ideas and processes results in a tremendous amount of genuinely
abstract and highly complex nominals which take up most of the text
(as testified also by the preliminary analysis of nominal density and N-Scale
818

SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT IN TEXTUAL CONTEXTS

level above). Although the adults in this study were not language experts or
professionals, their written expositories overflow with abstract nominals in
heavy NPs with high-register modifications, e.g. awareness of inter-personal
problems, social-psychological assistance, as well as educational effort as early
as school age; or a system of interpersonal interactions which bring to expression
the differences among individuals in society together with the application of each
individual and his tendencies in the environment.

CONCLUSIONS

This study presents a fresh perspective on lexical-semantic development
in textual contexts in the school years. The quantitative and qualitative
analyses of the Noun Scale across genre and modality demonstrate the
firm links between lexical-semantic and cognitive development, on the one
hand, and pragmatic factors such as text type, thematic content and social
context, on the other. The study points to the discourse-embedded nature
of lexical semantics : for example, by throwing light on the development of
a classically verbal category like temporality by means of noun reference.
The Noun Scale provides a dependable index of noun semantics and
constitutes a useful diagnostic tool not only for psycholinguists and child
development researchers, but also for clinical and educational practitioners.
Finally, although the current study is based on Hebrew data, the Noun
Scale is easily applicable to other languages, focusing on semantics and
pragmatics rather than language-specific morphology and syntax. Indeed,
initial analyses of comparable English data indicate that the same
Noun Scale criteria are applicable to English, with similar ranking and
distribution across development, genre, and modality.
