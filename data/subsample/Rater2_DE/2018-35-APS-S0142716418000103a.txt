ABSTRACT
This study investigated the time course of activation of orthographic information in spoken word
recognition with two visual world eye-tracking experiments in a task where second language (L2)
spoken word forms had to be matched with their printed referents. Participants (n = 64) were native
Finnish learners of L2 French ranging from beginners to highly proficient. In Experiment 1, L2 targets
(e.g., <cidre> /sid/) were presented with either orthographically overlapping onset competitors (e.g.,
<cintre> /st/) or phonologically overlapping onset competitors (<cycle> /sikl/). In Experiment 2,
L2 targets (e.g., <paume> /pom/) were associated with competitors in Finnish, L1 of the participants,
in conditions symmetric to Experiment 1 (<pauhu> /pauhu/ vs. <pommi> /pom:i/). In the withinlanguage experiment (Experiment 1), the difference in target identification between the experimental
conditions was not significant. In the between-language experiment (Experiment 2), orthographic
information impacted the mapping more in lower proficiency learners, and this effect was observed
600 ms after the target word onset. The influence of proficiency on the matching was nonlinear:
proficiency impacted the mapping significantly more in the lower half of the proficiency scale in both
experiments. These results are discussed in terms of coactivation of orthographic and phonological
information in L2 spoken word recognition.

There is a growing body of literature showing that just as phonological information
is activated during the processing of written language (see, e.g., Frost, 1998, for a
review), orthographic information is activated during the processing of spoken language (see Frost & Ziegler, 2007, for a review). There are, however, fewer studies
on the role of orthography in second language (L2) spoken word processing. In this
study, we are interested in how L2 learners with a formal instruction background
use orthographic information in spoken word recognition.
Late L2 learners differ from native language (L1) speakers because they already
use one phonological system that can influence the learning of another system (e.g.,
Best & Tyler, 2007), and because they are already familiar with the grapheme-
phoneme correspondences of their L1, which can have a strong impact on the
perception and learning of L2 sounds (Bassetti, 2006; Escudero, Hayes-Harb, &
Mitterer, 2008; Escudero & Wanrooij, 2010; Hayes-Harb, Nicol, & Barker, 2010;
Showalter & Hayes-Harb, 2015). In addition, unlike L1 speakers who learn orthographic word forms only after the phonological forms have been established, literate L2 learners in formal instruction are exposed to written word forms early on in
the learning process. The present study investigated how these L2 learners map L2
spoken words onto their written counterparts, specifically the extent to which this
mapping is mediated by orthographic or phonological information, and to which
L1 grapheme-phoneme correspondences are activated in this process. For this purpose, we conducted two experiments where spoken word forms had to be matched
with their printed referents while participants' eye movements were monitored.
We also set out to evaluate the role of L2 proficiency in this matching process.
Even though orthographic information is not necessary in L1 spoken language
processing, it is known to be activated even during (non-metaphonological) language processing tasks such as lexical decision that do not demand a special focus
on the phonotactic or orthotactic structure of the word forms (Grainger, Diependaele, Spinelli, Ferrand, & Farioli, 2003; Grainger & Ferrand, 1996; Salverda &
Tanenhaus, 2010; Ventura, Morais, Pattamadilok, & Kolinsky, 2004; Ziegler &
Ferrand, 1998, but see, e.g., Mitterer & Reinisch, 2015, for the lack of orthographic effects in the perception of conversational speech). These orthographic
effects have been explained by a simultaneous coactivation of phonological and
orthographic representations (e.g., Grainger et al., 2003) or by an activation of
orthographically restructured phonological representations (Taft, Castles, Davis,
Lazendic, & Nguyen-Hoan, 2008) during the processing of spoken words.
In the L1, the written forms of words are learned after their spoken forms, but in
L2 instructed learning environments, the two modalities are learned in parallel. As a
result of this co-structuration of orthographic and phonological information (Veivo
& Jarvikivi, 2013), orthography may have a more important role in the L2 lexicon
than in the L1 lexicon. Further, there is evidence that if the orthographic system of
the L2 is incongruent (i.e., if the phonemes can be represented by several different
graphemes or vice versa), parallel acquisition of orthography and phonology can
be a hindrance to the acquisition of the L2 phonological system (Escudero, Simon,
& Mulak, 2014).
In L2 spoken word processing, the activation of orthographic information has
been studied especially from the point of view of the parallel activation of the L1.
For example, Bartolotti, Daniel, and Marian (2013) showed that during spoken

Applied Psycholinguistics 39:5

1013

word recognition in a newly acquired L2, orthographically similar L1 word forms
are activated even if they are pronounced differently from the target words. This
result is complementary to studies showing that phonologically similar words of
both languages of bilingual or second language speakers compete for recognition
in parallel (Blumenfeld & Marian, 2007; Marian & Spivey, 2003a, 2003b; Spivey
& Marian, 1999).
The role of orthographic input for the learning of L2 phonology has been widely
studied (for reviews, see Bassetti, 2008; Young-Scholten, 2002). There is evidence
that orthography can help to acquire new phonemic categories of the L2 (Escudero
et al., 2008, 2014; Showalter & Hayes-Harb, 2013; Simon, Chambless, & Kickhofel Alves, 2010), but can also have a negative impact on the acquisition of L2
phonology (Bassetti, 2007; Bassetti & Atkinson, 2015; Young-Scholten & Langer,
2015), especially when the grapheme-phoneme relations of the L2 are different
from the L1 (Escudero & Wanrooij, 2010; Hayes-Harb et al., 2010). Furthermore,
there is evidence that late L2 learners in instructed learning environments can have
an orthographic bias in their lexical knowledge, especially in the recognition of
decontextualized word forms (Veivo, Suomela-Salmi, & Jarvikivi, 2015). At the
same time, words for these learners can have imprecise phonological representations (Cook & Gor, 2015; Cook, Panda, Lancaster, & Gor, 2016), which may lead
not only to the activation of false semantic content (Cook et al., 2016) but also to
increased lexical competition (Broersma & Cutler, 2011).
If the phonological representations of L2 words are more imprecise and unstable than those for L1 words, they may also be less well connected to their
orthographic counterparts. As proficiency in the L2 increases, phonological representations are likely to become more accurate (Darcy, Daidone, & Kojima, 2013)
and the orthographic bias in accessing semantic content decreases (Veivo et al.,
2015). Taken together, the lexicon of late L2 learners in instructed learning could be
orthographically biased so that orthographic representations may be more robust
than phonological representations. Moreover, this relative bias might decrease as
proficiency increases. In the present study, we evaluated this orthographic bias hypothesis by examining the flow of information from spoken word forms to written
word forms in late L2 learners at different proficiency levels.
Previous studies have shown that proficiency can influence orthographic activation in L2 spoken word processing: orthographic information during spoken
word processing is activated more rapidly and more strongly in more proficient
than in less proficient L2 learners (Mitsugi, 2016; Veivo & Jarvikivi, 2013; Veivo,
Jarvikivi, Porretta, & Hyona, 2016). Specifically, Veivo et al. (2016) used the visual world paradigm with printed referents and observed a significant effect for
the degree of orthographic overlap of the vowels in targets and competitors (target:
<mince> /ms/ "slim" vs. O+ competitor: <mite> /mit/ "moth" or O- competitor: <mythe> /mit/ "mythe"), but only for higher proficiency participants. This
suggests that orthographic information modulates L2 spoken word identification
at least for higher proficiency learners. However, Veivo et al. (2016) did not contrast the two types of within-language L2 competitors in the same experiment or
investigate the activation of between-language competitors from the participants'
L1 to evaluate the activation of L1 orthography in L2 spoken word processing.
The present study was designed to fill this gap.

CURRENT STUDY

In the present study, our main objectives were to investigate the mapping of spoken
L2 words onto their written referents, and to evaluate whether this mapping is mediated mainly via orthographic or phonological information. For this purpose, we
used the visual world eye-tracking paradigm (Allopenna, Magnuson, & Tanenhaus,
1998; Cooper, 1974; Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard, & Sedivy, 1995; for
a review, see Huettig, Rommers, & Meyer, 2011) in a task where spoken words
are matched with their written counterparts (cf. Huettig & McQueen, 2007, 2011;
McQueen & Viebahn, 2007). We studied Finnish learners of French with a wide
range of proficiency levels. The task in both experiments consisted of listening
to spoken instructions in French ("cliquez sur le mot cidre") and clicking on one
of the four words (target, competitor, and two unrelated distractors) that appeared
on the computer screen 200 ms before the acoustic onset of the target word. The
spoken target words were accompanied by a high orthographic low phonological overlap (OH-PL) competitor (e.g., <cidre> /sid/ "cider" vs. <cintre> /st/
"coat hanger") or a low orthographic high phonological overlap (OL-PH) competitor (e.g., <cidre> /sid/ vs. <cycle> /sikl/ "cycle") either in the L2 (Experiment
1) or in the L1 (Experiment 2).
If orthographic input in L2 acquisition leads to an orthographic bias in the
lexical knowledge of late L2 learners (e.g., Young-Scholten, 2002; for a review,
see Bassetti, 2008), we expect orthographically similar competitors to delay the
mapping more than phonologically similar competitors. If the precision of phonological representations depends on proficiency (Darcy et al., 2013), proficiency
will affect the speed of the mapping process. Based on previous results (Veivo &
Jarvikivi, 2013), lower proficiency learners might activate sublexical grapheme-
phoneme correspondences of the L1, which would show as increased activation of
phonologically similar L1 competitors in Experiment 2.
We started by investigating in Experiment 1 the matching of French spoken
and written L2 word forms in the presence of within-language orthographic and
phonological competitors.
EXPERIMENT 1
Method
Participants. Sixty-four students from the University of Turku participated for

course credit or volunteered. They reported no hearing impairment or language
deficits and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants were native
speakers of Finnish who had learned French as a foreign language in instructed
learning. None of the participants had acquired French or any other language
besides Finnish before the age of 3. Their age of onset for L2 French varied
between 5 and 45 (median = 14). This means that they were all either literate or
had started to acquire literacy in their L1 when they began to learn the L2. The
participants represented a wide range of proficiency levels ranging from beginners
to highly proficient. They evaluated their proficiency in French for five subskills
(listening, reading, spoken interaction, spoken production, and writing) with the
CEFR self-assessment grid (2001, pp. 26-27). Each subskill was self-assessed

on six levels, which were assigned values from 1 to 6. The maximum score for
proficiency for each participant was therefore 30.1 Participant-related background
information is summarized in Table 1.2
Materials. The visual displays comprised four words: target, competitor, and two
distractors. There were 20 target words (e.g., <cidre>) each associated with either
a OH-PL overlap competitor (e.g., <cintre>) or a OL-PH overlap competitor
(e.g., <cycle>). In the OH-PL condition, targets and competitors had a word
initial orthographic overlap of two letters so that the nucleus vowel of the first
syllable was always spelled similarly but pronounced differently (e.g., <cidre>
/sid/ "cider" vs. <cintre> /st/ "coat hanger").3 In the OL-PH condition, targets
and competitors always had a word-initial phonological overlap of two sounds so
that the nucleus vowel of the first syllable was pronounced similarly but spelled
differently (e.g., <cidre> /sid/ vs. <cycle> /sikl/ "cycle"). Each target (e.g.,
<cidre> /sid/) and its competitors (vs. <cintre> /st/ and <cycle> /sikl/) were
associated with two distractor words that were orthographically, phonologically,
and semantically unrelated.
The two competitors were matched for frequency (Lexique 3; New, Pallier,
Ferrand, & Matos, 2001) as well as possible. The mean frequency of the OH-PL
competitors was 43.7 per million and of the OL-PH competitors 47.9 per million.
In addition, distractors in each display were matched for frequency with the target,
32.6 and 35.3 per million, respectively. Targets, competitors, and distractors were
also matched for written length.4 The 20 target word sets are listed in Appendix
A. In addition to the target displays, 50 filler displays were constructed. In order to
avoid the participants developing test-taking strategies and recognizing the target
displays on the basis of formal similarity between the words, 20 of the filler displays
had an overlap between the distractor words. In 10 of these filler displays, the
distractors had an OH-PL overlap, and in 10 displays, the distractors had an OL-PH
overlap. The remaining 30 filler sets comprised four words with no orthographic,
phonological, or semantic overlap. In sum, Experiment 1 consisted of 70 trials (20
target word displays, 20 manipulated filler displays, and 30 filler displays).
Each target word was embedded in a French sentence instructing the participant
to click on the target word (e.g., "cliquez sur le mot cidre"). These sentences were
recorded digitally using the SANAKO Lab100 hardware in the Learning, Age and
Bilingualism laboratory at the University of Turku. A female native speaker of
French, unaware of the aims of the study, read the sentences in a randomized order
with a brief prosodic break before each target word. The mean duration for target
words was 616 ms.

Design and procedure. Each trial consisted of responding to the spoken in-

struction sentence (e.g., "cliquez sur le mot cidre"), by choosing the target
word with a mouse click among the four words appearing on the computer
screen. The position of each type of word was randomized for each display.
For the target word displays, the competitors in the two experimental conditions were counterbalanced between two lists so that each list contained an
equal number of OH-PL (10) and OL-PH (10) overlap competitors. The order for the presentation of the 70 trials was randomized for each participant,
and the participants were assigned to the two experimental lists in the order of
appearance.
Participants' eye movements were monitored using a head-mounted SR EyeLink
II eye-tracker (www.sr-research.com) sampling at 500 Hz. Each trial started with
drift correction where the participants fixated on a small cross appearing in the
center of the screen for the experimenter to accept the gaze accuracy. After that,
the spoken instruction to click on the target word was given via headphones. The
visual display (see Figure 1) appeared on the screen 200 ms before the onset
of the target word (cf. Huettig & McQueen, 2007; McQueen & Viebahn, 2007;
Salverda & Tanenhaus, 2010). As it takes about 200 ms to program and launch
a saccade after a stimulus is presented (Matin, Shao, & Boff, 1993), this assured
that the participants were not able to read the target words and have access to the
phonological form via orthography before hearing the targets. The written words
were presented in lowercase Times New Roman font being approximately 3 to 4
degrees wide, with the center of each word appearing approximately 8 degrees
from the center of the screen (Figure 1).
Before the main experiment, participants were familiarized with the task by
presenting a practice block of 10 displays consisting of unrelated words. After
that, they were presented with Experiments 1 and 2. The order of the experiments
was counterbalanced between participants.

Figure 2. Mean proportion of looks to each type of word in the two experimental conditions
in Exp. 1.

Results and discussion of Experiment 1

Five trials (0.5% of the data) were removed from the analyses because the participants clicked on the competitor word instead of the target word.5 The proportion
of looks to the targets, to the competitors, and to the distractors was determined
for each trial and for each participant by calculating the number of looks to each
word in 20-ms time bins. Mean proportions of looks to each type of word in the
two experimental conditions for a 1200-ms period starting from target word onset
are presented in Figure 2.
Proportions of looks to each type of word do not differ at word onset, but as
Figure 2 shows, looks to distractors start to diverge from target and competitor
looks in both experimental conditions at about 300 ms after the onset of the target
word. Looks to competitors increase until around 500 ms, and looks to targets
increase until reaching the asymptote around 1000 ms after onset. Therefore, we
examined the data more in detail within a time window ending at this latter time
point (200-1000 ms after target word onset). The proportions of fixations were
logit-transformed for statistical analyses (Fox & Weisberg, 2011),6 providing an
unbounded measure in which zero represents 50% of looks (Barr, 2008).
Visual world eye-tracking data is inherently time-series data and usually presents
nonlinearly over time (see Figure 2). In addition, it is possible that the time course
interacts with other continuous variables, such as proficiency (cf. Veivo et al.,
2016), which may also be nonlinear. We therefore used generalized additive mixed
modeling (GAMM; Baayen, Vasishth, Kliegl, & Bates, 2017; Hastie & Tibshirani,
1990; Wood, 2006), which does not assume a linear relationship between predictors and the response variable and is capable of modeling interactions between
continuous variables (here, time and proficiency; see Baayen et al., 2017; Baayen,
van Rij, de Cat, & Wood, 2018; Veivo et al., 2016). Furthermore, given the time
series nature of the data, GAMM also allows for the control of autocorrelation in
the data (see, e.g., Porretta, Kyrolainen, van Rij, & Jarvikivi, 2018). Autocorrelation relates to the correlation between data points in a time series; a measurement
at time point t is correlated to differing degrees with a measurement at time point

Applied Psycholinguistics 39:5

1018

t-i, depending on the lag. Autocorrelation is particularly problematic because it
can greatly increase overconfidence of the model estimates.
In order to understand how online target word processing is modulated by proficiency and overlap, we modeled logit transformed looks to the target word as
a function of time (200-1000 ms after target onset), proficiency (ranging from
A1 to C2), and overlap condition (OH-PL vs. OL-PH). In addition, list and trial
were included in the analysis as control variables. Finally, to control for individual
variation in looking behavior, we created the variable event. Here, event represents
the combination of participant and trial, capturing participants' variable responses
to different items in the experiment. Event was included in the model as a random effect, allowing each unique time series to have its own intercept in the model
(Baayen et al., 2016; Nixon, van Rij, Mok, Baayen, & Chen, 2016; Porretta, Tucker,
& Jarvikivi, 2016).
It is reasonable to expect that proficiency (a continuous variable) may influence
the time course of processing nonlinearly. To allow for this, we used a tensor
product (Wood, 2006) for a nonlinear relationship between time and proficiency.
Further, also using a tensor product, a difference surface (Baayen, 2010; Wood,
2006) was included for overlap condition. This approach allows for the evaluation
of the significance of the factor relative to the interaction of time and proficiency.
In this case, the difference surface informs how and where OH-PL is different
from the overall effect by adding an additional smoothing parameter on top of the
main trend (Zuur, Ieno, Walker, Saviliev, & Smith, 2009). Finally, trial order was
included as a smooth term, and list was included as a parametric term.
The model was fitted to the data through a series of steps in order to assess the
contribution of each variable. First, we fitted a full model (i.e., all the predictors,
as described above). Second, autocorrelation was estimated from the data ( =
0.895, indicating a fairly high correlation between subsequent time points), and
the model was refitted including this parameter to adjust the confidence of the
estimates. Third, we evaluated the contribution of the individual predictors in the
model. For this, two criteria were used: the p value of the term (indicating whether a
given effect is not zero) and maximum likelihood (ML) score comparison between
model variants (indicating whether the inclusion of the predictor improved the fit
of the model; Zuur et al., 2009). This process was done iteratively in a backward
stepwise fashion until the model contained only predictors that were statistically
significant and contributed to the model fit. Trial and the difference surface for
overlap condition were removed through the fitting process, indicating that the
order of presentation of the targets was not significant, 2 (2) = 1.017, p = .362, nor
was the type of overlap between targets and competitors, 2 (5) = 1.182, p = .797.
ML score comparisons with chi-square tests between variant models justified
including proficiency as an input variable, 2 (3) = 30.192, p < .001. The resulting model contained the following predictors: event, experimental list, Time x
Proficiency, and explained 30.6% of the deviance. The statistics for the parametric
and smooth terms of the model with the best fit are summarized in Table 2. The
significant effect of proficiency over time is depicted in Figure 3.
In interpreting the GAMM results, visual inspection of the figures is essential,
perhaps even more so than in other types of data analysis. Figure 3 presents the
interaction between proficiency and time as a regression surface, showing that

overall, as time progressed, participants were generally more likely to look at the
target. Here darker shades of gray represent fewer looks to the target, whereas
lighter shades of gray represent more looks to the target, and the contour lines
indicate the rate of change.
More interesting, as proficiency increased, the participants were more likely to
look at the target. Lower proficiency learners looked at the targets later than higher
proficiency learners. Proficiency especially influenced processing in participants
with proficiency scores under 15 (equal to CEFR-levels A1, A2, and B1) and did

so in a graded fashion. For example, if we follow the time course for participants
with proficiency scores 5 and 20, we find that lower proficiency participants were
less likely to fixate the targets (between 400 ms and 600 ms). However, we can also
see that the effect of proficiency was not linear along the proficiency continuum.
This is evidenced by the shape of the contour lines, which indicate a strong effect
of proficiency for participants with scores under 15 and little to no effect for
participants with scores over 15.
The results of Experiment 1 fail to provide evidence that the OH-PL overlap
between targets and within-language competitors delays the mapping between
spoken and written forms more than OL-PH overlap. This suggests that when
both orthographic and phonological competitors are present at the same time, both
orthographic and phonological information is used in the matching process to a
similar degree. We will return to this issue in detail in the General Discussion.
However, our results confirm that the speed of target identification depends on
L2 proficiency in a nonlinear fashion: more proficient L2 listeners fixate the targets faster than less proficient learners, and the influence of proficiency is more
pronounced in the lower half of the proficiency scale.
As we were interested in how the L1 modulates L2 performance, we next moved
on to investigate the activation of orthographic and phonological information from
the participants' L1 in the recognition of L2 word forms in Experiment 2. This
experiment was designed to examine the impact of L1 orthography on the mapping
process of the L2 at different proficiency levels.
EXPERIMENT 2
Method
Participants. Participants were the same as in Experiment 1.7 Therefore, the two

experiments were presented in a counterbalanced order between the participants.
Materials. As in Experiment 1, the visual displays consisted of four words: the

target, the competitor, and two distractor words. Experiment 2 comprised 28 target
words. Each French target word (e.g., <paume> /pom/ "palm") was associated
with a Finnish competitor with either a OH-PL overlap (e.g., <pauhu> /pauhu/
"roar") or a OL-PH overlap with the target word (e.g., <pommi> /pom:i/ "bomb").
In the OH-PL condition, targets and competitors had a word-initial orthographic
overlap of three letters so that the nucleus vowel of the first syllable was always
spelled similarly but pronounced differently according to L1 phoneme-grapheme
correspondences (cf. <paume> /pom/ vs. <pauhu> /pauhu/).8 In the OL-PH condition, targets and competitors always had a word-initial phonological overlap of
two sounds so that the nucleus vowel of the first syllable was always pronounced
as similarly as possible (the vowel systems of the two languages not being the
same) but spelled differently (cf. <paume> /pom/ vs. <pommi> /pom:i/). Each
target (e.g., <paume> /pom/) and its competitors (e.g., <pauhu> /pauhu/ and
<pommi> /pom:i/) were associated with two orthographically, phonologically,
and semantically unrelated distractors, one in the L1 and the other in the L2. The
visual display therefore always consisted of two words in the L2 (French), the

target and the first distractor, and of two words in the L1 (Finnish), the competitor and the second distractor. Competitors were matched as well as possible for
written frequencies reported in the unpublished Turun Sanomat newspaper lexical database (comprising 22.7 million word tokens) using the WordMill Lexical
Search Program (Laine & Virtanen, 1999). The mean frequency was 12.6 per
million for the OH-PL overlap competitors and 29.1 per million for the OL-PH
overlap competitors. Distractors were matched for frequency with the target. The
mean frequency of the target words was 118.8 per million; the mean frequency
of the distractor words was 109.7 per million (101.8 per million for the L1 distractors and 117.6 per million for the L2 distractors). The 28 target word sets are
listed in Appendix B. In addition to the target set, we constructed a 28-item filler
set that consisted of four words with no orthographic, phonological, or semantic
overlap. In the filler sets, the target and another word were in the L2 (French)
and two additional words were in the L1 (Finnish). The procedure for recording the targets was as in Experiment 1. The mean duration of target words was
592 ms.
Design and procedure. The design and procedure were identical to those in Ex-

periment 1.
Results and discussion of Experiment 2

Before the analyses, 6 trials (0.3% of the data) were removed from the data because
the participants erroneously clicked on the competitor word. As in Experiment 1,
the proportion of looks to the targets, to the competitors, and to the distractors
was determined for each trial and for each participant by calculating the number
of looks to each type of word in 20-ms time bins. The mean proportion of looks
to each word in the display for 1200 ms, starting from the target word onset, is
depicted in Figure 4.
Visual inspection of the plots shows that looks to distractors start to diverge
from competitor and target looks at about 300 ms and that looks to competitors
start to decline around 600 ms after target word onset. Looks to targets increase

until reaching the asymptote around 1000 ms. As in Experiment 1, the proportions
of looks in each 20-ms bin were logit-transformed for statistical analyses to give
an unbounded measure.
As in Experiment 1, we examined the time course of target identification more
in detail in a time window from 200 ms until 1000 ms after the target word onset.
Again, we used GAMM, and the model was structured exactly as in the analysis
of Experiment 1. The model was fitted using the same steps and procedure as in
Experiment 1. Through this process, an autocorrelation parameter of  = 0.895 was
included, and trial was removed from the input variables. ML score comparisons
with chi-square tests between variant models supported the inclusion of list, 2
(1) = 6.599, p < .001, the difference surface for overlap condition, 2 (6) =
11.860, p < .001, and proficiency, 2 (6) = 27.278, p < .001, as input variables.
The resulting model consisted of random intercepts for event, a parametric term
for list, an interaction between time and proficiency, and a difference surface for
overlap condition. This final model explains 38% of the deviance; the estimates
for the parametric and smooth terms are summarized in Table 3.
Panel 1 of Figure 5 presents the interaction of proficiency and time as a regression surface. As in the results of Experiment 1, as time progressed, participants
were generally more likely to look at the target. Again, lighter gray represent
greater likelihood of target looks, while darker gray represents lesser likelihood
of target looks, and the contour lines indicate the rate of change. Similar to Experiment 1, as proficiency increases, the participants were more likely to look at
the target; lower proficiency learners were less likely to look at the target over
time than higher proficiency learners. However, if we compare the shape of the
contour lines in Figures 3 and 5 (Panel 1), we can see that this effect in Experiment 2 is less pronounced than in Experiment 1, affecting primarily the lowest
proficiency learners with proficiency scores from 5 to 10 (CEFR levels A1 and
A2).
In contrast to Experiment 1, we also observed a significant adjustment due to
overlap condition (i.e., significant difference surface), indicating that the Time x
Proficiency surface for OH-PL (Figure 5, Panel 2) deviates significantly from the

main Time x Proficiency surface (Figure 5, Panel 1). Between the two panels we
see a greater influence of proficiency in the second half of the time course. As
explained above, Panel 1 of Figure 5 presents the effect of proficiency over time
for target looks in the whole data. To aid in the visualization of the effect of overlap
condition, Panel 2 depicts the same effect but with the difference surface added
to show the effect in the OH-PL-condition (e.g., <paume> /pom/ vs. <pauhu>
/pauhu/). Compared to Panel 1, Panel 2 shows that, in the second half of the time
course, participants with a proficiency score above 15 (CEFR-levels B2, C1, and
C2) were more likely to fixate the target, whereas participants with proficiency
scores below 15 (CEFR-levels A1, A2, and B1) were less likely to fixate the
target. The significant difference surface for overlap F (8.425, 72,249.49) = 3.839,
p < .001, indicated that this adjustment across proficiency was not zero after
approximately 600 ms after target word onset.
Thus, when presented with orthographic competitors from the participants' L1,
higher proficiency learners were more likely to look at the target while lower
proficiency learners were less likely to look at the target. In addition, learners in
the upper half of the proficiency scale behaved more uniformly than learners in
the lower half of the proficiency scale. In other words, lower proficiency learners showed more variation in the speed of finding the targets across proficiency
scores.
The results of Experiment 2 indicate that the mapping between L2 spoken and
written word forms is influenced by between-language competitors from the participants' L1. This finding is in line with previous findings on language nonselective
lexical access in L2 auditory word recognition (e.g., Lagrou, Hartsuiker, & Duyck,
2011). As in Experiment 1, the effect of proficiency on matching spoken and written
word forms was more pronounced in lower proficiency participants. Furthermore,
analysis of the time course of activation in the matching process with GAMM
revealed an effect of L1 orthographic overlap that appeared 600 ms after target
word onset: compared to the main trend, it was more difficult for the participants
in the lower half of the proficiency scale to find the targets (e.g., <paume> /pom/)

in the presence of OH-PL L1 competitors (e.g., <pauhu> /pauhu/). The effect of
proficiency was also more pronounced in the presence of OH-PL L1 competitors
for lower proficiency participants in this same time window.
These results suggest that in spoken word identification in late L2 learners, both
orthographically and phonologically similar L1 words are activated early in the
recognition process, but later on, orthographic information is activated more than
phonological information. In contrast to Veivo and Jarvikivi, (2013), we did not
find evidence for the effect of L1 orthography depending on proficiency. It is likely
that, unlike in masked priming that taps into the early phase of processing, in the
kind of matching task used in the present study, lower proficiency learners did not
rely on sublexical correspondences of the L1 more than on those of the L2. Instead,
we observed significantly more activation for orthographically similar L1 words at
all proficiency levels. Taken together, these results speak for an orthographically
mediated activation in matching the spoken and written word forms, compatible
with the orthographic bias hypothesis presented above.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

Our objective in the present study was to investigate the impact of orthographic and
phonological information in the matching of spoken and written L2 word forms.
This was done in the presence of within-language (Experiment 1) and betweenlanguage competitors (Experiment 2). We studied L1 Finnish late learners of L2
French and used the visual world eye-tracking paradigm with printed words as referents. We set out to evaluate the orthographic bias hypothesis, according to which
orthographic representations in late L2 learners are more robust than phonological
representations. This hypothesis makes the prediction that spoken L2 target words
activate mainly orthographic representations, and therefore orthographically similar competitors in the L2 and L1 should delay the mapping between spoken and
written L2 word forms more than phonologically similar competitors. Because
phonological representations are likely to become more accurate as proficiency
increases, proficiency was expected to affect the speed of target identification. For
L1 competitors, we predicted that higher proficiency learners might show orthographic effects, whereas lower proficiency learners might rely on L1 sublexical
correspondences, which would show as increased activation of phonologically
similar L1 competitors.
The results of our within-language experiment (Experiment 1) showed that orthographically and phonologically similar L2 word forms are activated rapidly,
around 300 ms after target word onset. This result is in line with previous visual
world studies reporting phonological effects (e.g., Huettig & McQueen, 2007)
and orthographic effects in L1 speakers (Salverda & Tanenhaus, 2010). The results of our between-language experiment (Experiment 2) showed that spoken L2
words also activated orthographically and phonologically similar word forms in
the participants' L1, Finnish.
In the within-language experiment (Experiment 1), competitors with an OH-PL
overlap did not delay target identification more than competitors with an OL-PH

overlap. Written competitors in the OH-PL condition were selected so that the
vowel of the nucleus was always pronounced differently from the targets (/sid/
<cidre> vs. /st/ <cintre>), whereas written competitors in the OL-PH condition
were always selected so that the vowel of the nucleus was pronounced similarly
to the targets (/sid/ <cidre> vs. /sikl/ <cycle>). If the participants had unstable
grapheme-phoneme correspondences in the L2, the competitors in the two overlap
conditions were not necessarily phonologically different for them. In addition, because the two competitors were allowed to share word-final letters (such as <e>),
the competitors may not have been orthographically different enough to produce
a significant difference. This result does not necessarily rule out the orthographic
bias hypothesis. It is possible that the activation spreads mainly via orthographic
representations. In other words, a spoken word like /sid/ activates its written counterpart <cidre>, which then sends activation to both <cintre> and <cycle>. This
is likely especially if the learners are not aware of the pronunciation difference
between the two written competitors.
In the between-language experiment (Experiment 2), the analysis revealed a
nonlinear interaction between time, proficiency, and the type of overlap. When
spoken L2 targets like /pom/ <paume> were presented with OH-PL competitors
from the participants' L1 (<pauhu> / pauhu/), these competitors delayed target
identification significantly compared to the main trend in a time window from
600 ms to 1000 ms after target onset for lower proficiency participants. In addition, the effect of proficiency was more prominent in the presence of these OH-PL
competitors for these participants in the same time window. Unlike in Experiment
1, the degree of phonological overlap between targets and competitors in Experiment 2 was unambiguous for participants at all proficiency levels, because the
competitors were in the L1. According to L1 pronunciation rules, there was always
a phonological mismatch between L2 targets and L1 OH-PL competitors. Therefore, spoken L2 words such as /pom/ <paume> could activate OH-PL competitors
such as /pauhu/ <pauhu> only via orthographic representations.9 As predicted
by the orthographic bias hypothesis, orthographic representations are activated
significantly more than phonological representations at this relatively late time
point.
Unlike we assumed on the basis of previous results (Veivo & Jarvikivi, 2013),
lower proficiency learners were not relying on L1 grapheme-phoneme correspondences in Experiment 2, because written L1 competitors that could be pronounced
similarly to the targets did not delay the matching. Instead, the delay in target word
recognition due to orthographically similar L1 competitors was even more salient
for lower proficiency learners. This is in line with the assumption that the orthographic bias would be more prominent in lower proficiency learners and decrease
as proficiency increases. It is also possible that the higher proficiency learners were
more able to suppress the irrelevant between-language information and that this
suppression was enhanced when the orthographic information made it clearer what
the unfolding word form would be. This interpretation is in line with the results of
Blumenfeld and Marian (2013), which suggest that more efficient cognitive control
is associated with reduced cross-linguistic activation in bilinguals in a relatively
late phase of lexical competition (633-767 ms).

Based on previous research (e.g., Mitsugi, 2016; Veivo & Jarvikivi, 2013; Veivo
et al., 2016), we assumed that proficiency would influence the speed of the matching process. Our results confirmed this assumption: in both experiments, higher
proficiency learners identified the targets significantly faster than lower proficiency
learners. This difference in processing speed suggests that lower proficiency learners have less precise phonological representations to base the matching on (cf.
Cook et al., 2016). However, the effect of proficiency on the speed of looking at
the targets was not linear throughout the proficiency continuum: the lower proficiency learners were not only generally slower in looking at the target than higher
proficiency learners but also relatively slower the less proficient they were, unlike
learners in the upper half of the proficiency continuum (CEFR-levels B2, C1, and
C2) who behaved more homogenously in the task. This suggests that until this
point, connections between the modalities develop gradually, but that above this
point, they have mostly been acquired.
The results of the present study are discussed above in terms of coactivation
orthographic and phonological information in spoken word processing (see, e.g.,
Grainger et al., 2003). This same principle underlies the structure of the Bilingual
Language Interaction Network for Comprehension of Speech (BLINCS; Shook &
Marian, 2013). In BLINCS, different levels of representation are represented by
self-organizing maps that structure language input from both languages according
to similarity between units. Further, ortholexical and phonolexical levels of representations are shared between both languages and interconnected via bidirectional
links. In this respect, the architecture of BLINCS is similar to the interactive activation models of bilingual written word recognition like BIA+ (Dijkstra & van
Heuven, 2002).
To our knowledge, there are no current models of L2 spoken word recognition that would comprise a possibility for interaction between the modalities. The
BLINCS model was designed to model spoken word recognition in bilingual speakers, but it could be used to describe the coactivation of orthographic information
in spoken word recognition also in late L2 learners. The results of the current
study suggest that there are two important proficiency-related features that should
be considered in modeling L2 spoken word recognition: the relative strength of
ortholexical and phonolexical representations as well as the degree of activation of
L1 orthography are different depending on the level of L2 proficiency. Although
BLINCS assumes that both languages are known equally well, its architecture
based on the self-organizing principle fits well for describing also L2 spoken word
recognition. Lower proficiency learners have less experience with L2 word forms,
especially in speaking, and this lower frequency in the input causes the phonolexical representations to become weaker, or fuzzier (see Cook et al., 2016), than
ortholexical representations.
The results of our Experiment 2 indicate that lower proficiency learners are
also less efficient in inhibiting the activation of L1 word forms. The results of
Veivo and Jarvikivi (2013) suggest that this effect may rise from the sublexical
phoneme level. Further, this finding suggests that L2 spoken language processing
mechanisms could be qualitatively different at different proficiency levels. In sum,
our results show that orthography and L2 proficiency are factors that should be
incorporated in any model of L2 spoken word recognition.

In the present study, we compared the use of orthographic and phonological
information in the mapping of spoken and written L2 word forms. Based on studies
on the importance of orthographic input in L2 acquisition (e.g., Young-Scholten,
2002), it was hypothesized that there is an orthographic bias in late L2 learners'
lexicons with orthographic representations being more robust and accurate than
phonological representations. This bias predicts increased orthographic activation
in L2 spoken word processing compared to phonological activation. The results
of our between-language experiment are compatible with this hypothesis because
orthographically similar L1 words delayed the matching process significantly more
than phonologically similar L1 words. However, the results of our within-language
experiment did not provide straightforward evidence in support of the orthographic
bias, and therefore it should be evaluated in subsequent research. Finally, our results
suggest that the competences needed for combining phonological and orthographic
word forms develop significantly more in the lower half than in the upper half of the
proficiency scale. Whether the findings on activation of orthographic information
apply to more naturalistic L2 spoken word processing contexts remains a question
for future research.

et al., 2002) in a previous study (Veivo et al., 2015) showed that self-reported proficiency scores based on the CEFR scale correlated highly with DIALANG test
results.
An L1 speaker control group (n = 24) completed Experiment 1 for control purposes.
A linear mixed-effect regression analysis of the looks to targets showed that the L1
group was marginally faster than the L2 group in finding the targets, and that the type
of overlap in the L1 group was not significant.

This was done because it was not possible to find competitors within the selection criteria with longer orthographic overlap. This is due to the relatively consistent grapheme
to phoneme relations of French.
To meet the selection criteria, a one-letter difference in length between the words in
the display was allowed.
In addition, three targets were removed because of an error in choosing the OL-PH
competitors.
Logit-transformation applies a small adjustment to the values 0 and 1 (using 0.025 and
0.975, respectively).
The same L1 control group who participated in Experiment 1, also participated in
Experiment 2 for continuity, but the data were not analyzed in more detail because the
participants did not have any knowledge of Finnish, the language of the competitor
words.
It was not possible to find competitors with equal syllable length in Finnish. It is
therefore possible that if the participants knew any one-syllable target words, it may
have helped to overrule competitors with two syllables.
Because grapheme to phoneme correspondences in Finnish are different from French,
there was more variation in the OL-PH competitors in the between-language experiment
(Experiment 2) than in the within-language experiment (Experiment 1). Whether this
may impact participants to rely more on orthography should be studied in a subsequent
experiment contrasting OL-PH competitors from both languages.
