ABSTRACT

This study aimed to clarify the development of conversational style in
Japanese mother-child interactions. We focused on the frequency of
speech overlap as an index of Japanese conversational style, with
particular attention to ne, a particle produced by the speaker, and to
backchannels, such as ` uh-huh ', produced by the listener that support
sympathetic conversation. The results of longitudinal observations of
two Japanese mother-child dyads from approximately 0 ;11 to 3;3
suggest that an adultlike conversational style with frequent overlaps
emerges in Japanese child-directed speech around the two-word
utterance period, and a child's development of ne use is closely related
to this shift.
INTRODUCTION

This study investigated the development of Japanese conversational style
in mother-infant vocal interactions. Japanese conversational style is
characterized by frequent speech overlaps. Therefore, we focused on the
frequency of these overlaps, paying particular attention to the use of backchannels and ne. Backchannels are brief interjections such as `uh-huh ' by the
listener that indicate empathy, agreement, and understanding and encourage
the speaker to continue speaking. Ne is a particle used by the speaker to
express his/her request for acknowledgment or empathy from the listener.

The topic of turn-taking in conversational interactions has been a focus
of studies on language acquisition and social development for more than
three decades. Such developmental studies are founded on the theory
that infants control their vocalization in response to the speech of others
and that this is the basis for language acquisition. Sacks, Schegloff &
Jefferson (1974), in one of the earliest studies of conversation analysis,
described a turn-taking rule in English conversation among adults : the
conversation continues smoothly following a simple rule, `no gap, no
overlap '. Speech overlap, here defined as occurring when the second
speaker starts speaking before the first speaker has finished, happens
infrequently in natural English dialogues, with some variations depending
on the relationship between participants, as well as on gender and geography (review : Carroll, 1999).
Speech overlap has been mentioned in relation to the acquisition of
the turn-taking rule in young infants. Co-vocalization is predominant in
mother-infant vocal interactions at 0; 3 or 0;4 (Stern, Jaffe, Beebe &
Bennett, 1975). Subsequently, the alternating pattern becomes predominant
at 0; 9 (Jasnow & Feldstein, 1986). Ginsburg & Kilbourne (1988) found that
this alternation shift occurred at an earlier period, 0;3-0;5, than that
reported by Jasnow & Feldstein. The proportion of speech overlap occurrence in their study, 6%, was almost the same as in adult conversations, 5 %
(Levinson, 1983). Elias & Broerse (1996) reported that overlapping
decreased until age 1; 6 but increased from 1; 6 to 2;0. They considered this
increase to be caused by the lengthened duration of children's speech in
accordance with their language development.
In contrast, with English conversations, Japanese adult conversations
show frequent speech overlaps. For instance, Iwa, Enomoto, Ohya, Shimano
& Tutiya (1998) showed that 45 % of utterances overlapped when two people
were exchanging information verbally to identify a route on a map. Koiso,
Horiuchi, Tutiya & Ichikawa (1996) reported that many overlaps were
introduced by the first speakers. Whereas a single participant holds the floor
in English conversation, Japanese conversation is organized in terms of
cooperation between participants (Mizutani, 1988; Kita, 1996). In Japanese
conversation, the emotional bond between participants is emphasized and
supported by introducing and maintaining listeners' vocal interventions
during a speaker's turn (Maynard, 1994).
Most of the speech overlaps in Japanese conversations are backchannels
designed to facilitate the conversation without interruption (Maynard, 1986).
A backchannel, or minimal response, transmits the listener's intention to
show empathy, agreement, or understanding, and to allow the speaker
to continue speaking. A backchannel is occasionally referred to as an
acknowledgment, such as ` uh-huh ' in English and `un' or `hai ' in Japanese.
A backchannel generally does not take a turn. A listener frequently produces
216

SPEECH OVERLAP IN MOTHER-CHILD CONVERSATIONS

overlapping backchannels, especially in informal Japanese conversations
(Mizutani, 1988 ; Imaishi, 1994).
The listener's backchannels are often prompted by the speaker using
some prosodic and syntactic cues to which a listener can respond. One of
the main factors behind a listener's frequent use of backchannels is the
speaker's use of ne (Imaishi, 1994; Maynard, 1994). Ne is a particle often
used in Japanese dialogues (Maynard, 1994) and it expresses a speaker's
mild request for agreement from a listener, such as `you know ' or `right ? '
in English conversations (Squires, 1994). Cook (1992, p. 527) described an
example of such ne use :
M : Oshokuji no toki ni Mama shikaritaku nai kedo ne(e)
meal LK time at Mom scold-want NEG but FP
` I don't want to scold (you) at dinner time but, '
H : Un.
Uh-huh
` Uh-huh '
(LK : Linking nominal, NEG : negative morpheme, FP : sentence-final
particle)
In particular, ne is a device for negotiating cooperation, indicating affective
common ground, and signalling intimate relationships (Cook, 1992). These
previous reports support the idea that ne very frequently evokes overlapping
utterances, even though the relationship between the use of ne and speech
overlap has never been studied directly in adult conversations.
As Elias & Broerse (1989) showed, avoiding simultaneous speech is an
indicator that turn-taking has been accomplished in mother-infant vocal
interactions. However, the use of the turn-taking rule in Japanese adult
conversations is different from that in mother-infant vocal interactions.
As the mother-child conversational style gradually develops into the
adultlike style, the frequency of speech overlap should increase in Japanese
mother-child conversations. Mothers regulate their vocalization according
to their infants' or children's processing ability, and at the same time, they
play a leading role in developing the communication style between child and
mother (Kaye & Charney, 1981). It is important to clarify when and how
mother-child conversation develops into a mature conversational style so
that it can be correlated with cognitive, linguistic, pragmatic, and social
development. To investigate this shift, we focused on the proportion of
speech overlap occurrence as an index of the acquisition of Japanese adult
conversational style in mother-child vocal interactions.
In the present study, we attempted to answer three questions. First,
when and how does the proportion of speech overlap change according to
children's development ? Secondly, do backchannels contribute to the
speech overlap in mother-child vocal interactions? Thirdly, is there any
217

K A J I K A W A E T A L.

relationship between the use of ne by the first speaker and the speech
overlap by the second speaker ? We also analysed the proportions of the
overlaps with and without ne taking into consideration the effect of the
duration of the first speaker's utterance.
METHOD

Participants
The participants were two healthy children and their mothers. They were
contributors to the Children's Vocalization Database Project of the NTT
Corporation. One child, SA, was a girl and the other child, SK, was a boy,
and both were the first-born children of Japanese parents living near Tokyo.
Two research assistants separately counted the first words produced by
SA and SK from the tape. With reference to Nelson (1973), the research
assistants counted spontaneously-produced words that were not simply an
attempt to mimic the preceding utterance. Words that both assistants
selected were considered to be acquired words. In the same way, two-word
utterances were also listed. SA produced her first words at 0;11 and twoword utterances at 1 ; 5. SK's first words emerged at 1;0 and two-word
utterances at 1; 7.
Data collection
Between the ages of 0 ; 0 and 5; 0, the utterances of both children and their
parents were audio-recorded under natural conversational settings at home,
using a digital audio tape recorder and an attached microphone. Other
family members occasionally joined the conversations. The recordings were
made once a week and the total recording time for each month was from one
to two hours.
Data analysis
Sound recordings for analysis were extracted almost every month. Acoustic
editing software was used to record some information in a text file. This
information consisted of speech transcriptions (e.g. choudai, give me), types
of vocalization (e.g. singing), speaker's identification (e.g. child), and the
start and end time of the vocalization. Two people who did not know
the aim of this study were involved in this operation : one person described
the information and the other then assessed it.
An utterance was defined as one speaker's continuous vocalization,
containing no silence longer than 0.5 s. In further analysis, we excluded
singing, reading, and non-linguistic sounds (laugh, cry, sneeze, cough, mouth
trembling, scream, tongue sound, yawn, and hiccup). Two consecutive
utterances of two different speakers were defined as an utterance pair if the
interval between those two utterances was shorter than 5.0 s.
218

SPEECH OVERLAP IN MOTHER-CHILD CONVERSATIONS

Data recorded during the period from the appearance of first words to
approximately three years of age were used for analysis. SA was aged 0;11
to 3; 1, and SK was 1; 0 to 3; 3 (Table 1). The total recording time was 15
hours for SA and 25 hours for SK. The total number of sequential utterance pairs was 4189 for SA ` mother p child ' (the mother was the first
speaker), 4339 for SA ` child p mother' (the child was the first speaker),
1487 for SK ` mother pchild ', and 1559 for SK `child pmother '.
The proportion of overlap was calculated for each month using the
following formulae :
MOP (Mother's overlap proportion)=(Number of overlapping utterances
by mother)=(Total number of ` child ! mother' utterance pairs)
COP (Child's overlap proportion)=(Number of overlapping utterances
by child)=(Total number of ` mother ! child ' utterance pairs)
The proportions of backchannels in overlapping speech were calculated
for the mothers and children. The following utterances were considered to
be backchannels by reference to an analysis of adult backchannel use : a :, e :,
hu:n, hai, n :, sou and un (Katagiri, Sugito & Nagano-Madsen, 2001).
All utterance pairs were categorized into two groups according to whether
the first speaker's utterance did or did not include ne as a particle. We then
calculated the proportion of overlaps for both mothers and children at each
month of age, and compared the proportion for the cases in which the
previous speech included ne and those in which it did not include ne.

RESULTS

Proportion of overlap
The variation in the proportion of overlapping utterances exhibited a
similar pattern for the two mother and child pairs from the emergence of
their first words to approximately 3 ; 0 (Figure 1). The MOPs were at their
lowest point at 1;5-1 ; 6 and increased after 1; 5-1 ;6. SA's mother overlapped her child's speech at a proportion of 0.1 to 0.2 over the 0; 11 to 1; 3
age range. After 1; 5, SA's mother overlapped at a proportion of more than
0.2. Through the observation period, the MOP increased linearly in the SA
pair (MOP=0.05+0.008 * child's age, F(1,13)=12.38, p<0.01). In the SK
pair, the MOP did not increase linearly during the period (F(1,13)=1.02,
ns). The overlapping of SK's mother's speech decreased between 1;0 and
1; 6, and increased after 1 ; 6, which appeared significantly in cubic
regression analysis (F(1,11)=4.39, p<0.05).
The children showed different tendencies from their mothers. The COP
did not change significantly during the period (SA : linear : F(1,13)=4.06,

frequently than her child did after 1; 8 (MOP : M=0.32, S.D.=0.05, COP :
M=0.20, S.D.=0.05, t(5)=4.49, p<0.01).
Proportion of overlapping backchannels
Table 2 shows the proportion of the mothers' and the children's overlaps
that contained backchannels. Both SA's mother and SK's mother showed a
proportion of more than 0.1 at most ages. After 1;5, SA's mother produced
backchannels at a proportion of more than 0.2 and the proportion almost
reached 0.5 after 2; 3. For SK, the proportion of the mother's overlapping
backchannels was around 0.3 at ages of 1; 1-1 ; 4 and roughly 1;7-3; 3. The
proportions were more than 0.4 at ages of 1; 11 and 2;4-3 ;3.
By contrast, the children used a relatively low proportion of overlapping
backchannels. Their proportions were nearly 0.0, with the exception of the
last three ages recorded for both children.
Relation between speech overlap and ne
SA made 345 utterances including ne and SK made 38 during the observational period. The use of ne by SA appeared at 1 ;5 and increased greatly
after 2 ; 0 and 2; 3. SK started to use ne at 1 ; 8 and his use did not increase
greatly until 3; 3.
Figure 2 shows the MOP when the children used and did not use ne.
The mothers overlapped their children's speech more frequently when the
children used ne than when they did not, after 1 ;5 for SA (With ne :
M=0.43, S.D.=0.21, Without ne : M=0.21, S.D.=0.08, t(9)=3.55, p<0.01)
and 1; 9 for SK (With ne : M=0.73, S.D.=0.27, Without ne : M=0.25,
S.D.=0.11, t(4)=3.33, p<0.05).
In ` mother pchild ' utterance pairs, in which the children responded to
the mothers' utterances, SA's overlap occurred equally for her mother's
utterances with and without ne (Figure 3, With ne : M=0.26, S.D.=0.13,
Without ne : M=0.20, S.D.=0.08, t(14)=1.16, ns). SK did not overlap his
mother's utterances more when they included ne either (With ne : M=0.21,
S.D.=0.19, Without ne : M=0.22, S.D.=0.06, t(14)=x0.26, ns).
In order to ascertain whether maternal overlaps are more likely to occur
when child utterances are longer or include ne, a (2) child ne userchild
utterance duration ANOVA was conducted. The criterion for the duration
grouping was the average duration of the child's utterances, namely 1.46 s
for SA and 1.84 s for SK. The MOPs of the two duration groups for SA
are shown in Figure 4, comparing the child's utterances with and without
ne. The main effects of ne use and duration were significant (ne use :
F(1,9)=14.77, p<0.01 ; duration : F(1,9)=6.47, p<0.05, there were no data
for 1; 7 because no utterance with ne was longer than the average value).
For SK, the main effect of duration was significant but that of ne use was

DISCUSSION

Our analysis of the overlap proportion in utterance pairs for two Japanese
mother and child dyads revealed that the mothers' speech overlap started to
increase at around 1; 5-1 ; 7, that is, the period during which the children
started to produce two-word utterances. SA's mother's speech overlap

increased linearly throughout the observational period; however, this was
not the case with SK's mother. Her overlap proportion was relatively high
during SK's first-word stage and decreased until SK began to produce
two-word utterances at 1 ; 7. The speech overlap of SK's mother started
to decrease later than that reported for English mothers (Stern et al., 1975 ;
Jasnow & Feldstein, 1986 ; Ginsburg & Kilbourne, 1988). Nevertheless, the
tendency for overlapping speech to decrease is consistent with studies of
English mother-infant conversational style. However, after 1;6, the speech
overlaps made by SK's mother increased. Thus, in both the SA and SK
dyads, the mothers' overlap proportion increased and tended to approach

the overlap proportion of Japanese adult conversations, i.e. 45% (Iwa et al.,
1998).
We predicted that most of the speech overlaps in mother-infant vocal
interactions would be backchannels as found in Japanese adult conversations.
However, most mothers' speech overlaps were not typical backchannels when
their children were very young (i.e. around 1; 0). The mothers' responses to
their children were various, even though some of their responses functioned
like backchannels in adult conversations. However, after 2 ;3, the mothers'
backchannels were produced with a proportion similar to that found in
Japanese adult conversations, approximately 65 %. The mothers frequently
produced overlapping backchannels when their children were approximately
two and a half years of age.
There are certain factors that trigger the increase in the mothers' overlapping and their use of adultlike conversational style in child-directed
speech. This shift in the features of maternal speech can be explained
mainly by factors in the children's development : language, cognition,
and social communication skills.
First, children's language development influences the length and structure of their speech. The overlapping speech of the mothers in this study
started to increase roughly when their children began to produce two-word
utterances. It has been reported that the duration of Japanese children's
speech lengthens after the beginning of two-word utterances (Amano &
Kondo, 2002). There is therefore more chance of speech overlap occurring
226

SPEECH OVERLAP IN MOTHER-CHILD CONVERSATIONS

when the children's utterances are long than when they are short. Thus, the
possibility of speech overlap occurring will be higher after the emergence of
two-word utterances than in the single-word utterance period. Elias &
Broerse (1996) calculated the ` chance' level of a speech overlap occurring in
mother-infant conversation during 0; 3 to 2; 0, and the level increased from
1; 6 to 2 ; 0. The increase in speech duration and frequency prompted an
increase in the probability of speech overlaps.
In addition to changes in speech length, children's speech structure
changes as their language develops. A two-word utterance consists of
two components, i.e. two words, and there is a boundary between these
components ; for example, there is sometimes a short pause between them.
This short pause in children's speech possibly induces an overlap from the
mother because it is easy to start speaking during this small gap. In addition, it is difficult for mothers to anticipate the end of their children's
speech once the children have started to produce word combinations.
Our analysis supported part of this argument. When the duration of the
child's utterance was longer than average, the mother overlapped more than
when it was shorter than average. Therefore, longer utterances tended to be
frequently overlapped ; this might be a factor in the increase of the mother's
overlaps. However, it is worth noting that Japanese mothers overlap their
children's speech much more frequently than English-speaking mothers do.
This indicates that the increase in the mothers' overlaps is also caused by a
factor other than just the developmental change in the length and structure
of the children's speech.
Secondly, cognitive and perceptual development might enable children to
process their mothers' overlapping speech. When mothers talk to their
children, they tune their speaking behaviour to the ability of their children.
Mothers tend to speak slowly to children; this is known as motherese or
child-directed speech (Fernald, 1994). Child-directed speech changes in its
acoustic and temporal features as a child develops. In English mother-child
dyads, mothers gradually shorten the switching pause of their responses to
children's utterances when children are between the ages of 0;0 and 2; 0
(Stern, Spieker, Barnett & MacKain, 1983). Similarly, Japanese mothers
respond to children's utterances by shortening the switching pause up to the
age of 2 ; 0, and at that time the switching pause settles at a length which is
almost the same as in adult conversations, i.e. 0.4s (Kajikawa, Amano &
Kondo, 2002). Since this maternal behaviour could be interpreted as a kind
of scaffolding behaviour (Wood & Middleton, 1975), we consider that
children at 2; 0 can process and understand maternal speech much faster
than at earlier ages. It is likely that after reaching 2;0 children possess
perceptual and cognitive abilities for processing their mothers' overlapping
speech. Then mothers may become less concerned about avoiding speech
overlaps. Although English speakers generally interpret an overlap as an
227

interruption, Japanese children learn from maternal speech that in some
instances this is not the case.
The third factor behind the increase in mothers' overlapping utterances is
the children's development of social communication skills. Children start to
learn about the social aspects of conversation at around 2;0 (Owens, 2000).
For Japanese speakers, one of the important communication skills is ne use.
It was supposed that mothers started to increase overlapping speech with
the emergence of their children's ne use. As predicted, our results showed
that mothers overlapped children's utterances with ne more than those
without ne, regardless of the utterance duration. Therefore, the children's
use of ne might be a strong signal triggering the mothers' use of an overlap.
Tanaka (2000) described the location of ne in a turn as indicating its
function. According to her discussion, ne at a turn-internal location
expresses a speaker's intention to continue his/her turn, and ne at a turnfinal location invites a change of the turn. When ne is at a turn-final
location, it may become hard for the second speaker to overlap. That is,
after hearing ` ne ' at a turn-final location, the second speaker has little time
to start overlapping speech. Therefore, it is probable that the second
speaker, mothers in this study, predict the occurrence of ne before it is
produced, using syntactic and prosodic information as a cue. To verify this
prediction, it is necessary to take into account the locations of ne and its
syntactic and prosodic contexts in future analyses.
In contrast with their mothers, the children did not exhibit a high
frequency of speech overlapping from 1 ; 0-3 ;0. Moreover, children overlapped their mothers' utterances with and without ne equally, at most ages.
This means that children in that age range have yet to acquire the timing
of adultlike turn-taking. From birth to three years of age, the switching
pause is longer when Japanese children respond to their mothers' speech
than when mothers answer their children (Kajikawa et al., 2002). Namely,
children have not yet developed sufficiently in terms of articulation, speech
planning, and speech processing.
Another possible reason for the children exhibiting fewer overlaps than
their mothers is that children have not yet acquired an adultlike listener's
role. Playing the listener's role is difficult for children because it is necessary
to be conscious of the social aspects of conversation. Young infants control
the timing of their vocalizations in interaction with their mothers (Masataka,
1993), and children start to recognize their mothers as a communication
partner after the second year of life (Owens, 2000). Nevertheless, children
are still not proficient at building a bridge for the next speaker's turns.
Therefore, at around two years old, there is an asymmetry between mother
and child as regards responding to the other's utterances. Bedrosian,
Wanska, Sykes, Smith & Dalton (1988) reported that American children
from 2; 2-2 ; 6 overlapped less frequently than their parents. The absolute
228

SPEECH OVERLAP IN MOTHER-CHILD CONVERSATIONS

proportion of overlapping speech in Japanese mother-child dyads is much
higher than the overlap proportion of their English counterparts, but a
disproportion between mother and child was observed for both languages.
The results of this study provide no evidence for or against the possibility
that the children are aware of the function of ne. The children might have
had little knowledge about the function of ne, at the emergence of ne use.
They simply began to use ne because they had often heard it in others'
speech. The children learned the function of ne later, after hearing their
mothers' responses to their use of ne. One of the children, SA, seemed to be
acquiring ` appropriate ' responses to her mother's speech including ne after
2; 6. To clarify whether or not children understand the function of ne, we
need to investigate the content and form of children's responses to mothers'
ne, and the timing of the children's answers.
In summary, Japanese conversational style with frequent speech overlaps
appeared in mother-child vocal interactions at the emergence of two-word
utterances. Most overlaps were made by mothers who promoted the
development of interactions with children. As Broerse & Elias (1994)
pointed out, it is mainly mothers who manipulate the temporal structure of
conversations. However, three factors of children's development, namely
language, cognition, and social communication skills, may be related to the
increase in the mothers' overlaps. Utterance length, a factor of language
development that we considered, was related to the mother's overlap
proportion. In addition, the children's use of ne appeared to play an
important role in eliciting the mothers' overlapping utterances. Children's
skills as regards the use of overlapping speech in response to others ' utterances with ne may develop at a later stage, probably at four or five years of
age, because it is at around 3; 0 that talkativeness increases (Wells, 1985).
Speech overlapping by children should be further examined to establish
when children acquire the ability to recognize the social aspects of their
vocal communication.
