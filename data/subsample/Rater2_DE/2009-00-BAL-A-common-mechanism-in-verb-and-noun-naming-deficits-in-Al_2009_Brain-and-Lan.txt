We tested the ability of Alzheimer's patients and elderly controls to name living and non-living nouns,
and manner and instrument verbs. Patients' error patterns and relative performance with different categories showed evidence of graceful degradation for both nouns and verbs, with particular domain-specific impairments for living nouns and instrument verbs. Our results support feature-based, semantic
representations for nouns and verbs and support the role of inter-correlated features in noun impairment, and the role of noun knowledge in instrument verb impairment.

1. Introduction
Semantic impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been
central to several theoretical accounts of semantic memory, but
much of the research on these impairments has focused on nouns
(e.g., Bonilla & Johnson, 1995; Garrard, Lambon Ralph, Hodges, &
Patterson, 2001; Gonnerman, Andersen, Devlin, Kempler, & Seidenberg, 1997; Hodges & Patterson, 1995). Although nouns are an
essential part of language, it is the lexical representation of verbs
that is often considered most crucial for certain aspects of language
processing, most notably sentence comprehension (e.g., Boland,
Tanenhaus, & Garnsey, 1990; MacDonald, Pearlmutter, & Seidenberg, 1994). Recently, several researchers have recognized the
importance of verb semantic performance for the overall understanding of semantic impairments in AD and have begun to explore
verb performance in these patients (e.g., Druks et al., 2006; Fung
et al., 2001; Grossman, Mickanin, Onishi, & Hughes, 1996; Grossman, Mickanin, Onishi, Robinson, & D'Esposito, 1997; Parris &
Weekes, 2001; Robinson, Grossman, White-Devine, & D'Esposito,
1996). Despite these efforts, the extent and nature of verb impairments in this population remains controversial. The research reported here aims to advance our understanding of the verb

impairments in AD by establishing whether theoretical constructs
and models that have been developed to account for noun and verb
naming impairments can explain the performance of AD patients.
In particular, we investigate the implications of naming deficits
for the previously hypothesized organization of semantic representations of nouns and verbs within a feature-based framework.
The semantic representation of abstract nouns and verbs is not
well understood even in unimpaired populations and we therefore
chose to only examine impairments to imageable nouns and verbs.
Although this choice may restrict the generality of our results, it allowed us to address the broader theoretical implications of our
finding by relating it to previous theoretical work on the semantic
representation of concrete nouns. In particular, we wanted to see
whether AD patients' verb impairment can be captured in the same
feature-based distributed representation framework that several
investigators have used to explain semantic deficits with concrete
nouns (e.g., Aronoff et al., 2006; Devlin, Gonnerman, Andersen, &
Seidenberg, 1998; Gonnerman et al., 1997; Saffran & Sholl, 1999;
Shallice, 1993; Tyler & Moss, 2001). In a feature-based framework,
conceptual knowledge is represented by connections between features and concepts, and the activation of concepts corresponds to a
pattern of activation over distributed featural representations. In
this framework, the relation between concepts is based on the
number of features the two concepts share (featural overlap),
which largely maps onto perceived similarity between concepts

A. Almor et al. / Brain & Language 111 (2009) 8-19

(Maki, Krimsky, & Munoz, 2006; Rips, Shoben, & Smith, 1973; Tversky, 1977). Featural overlap also gives rise to other relations beyond similarity. For instance, ``contrast coordinate" relations exist
between concepts that differ in only a small number of features
(e.g., zebra and horse), and ``super-ordinate" relations exist when
the features of one concept are a subset of another concept's features (e.g., animal and horse).
Although the majority of the work on the relationship between
the structure and organization of the featural system and semantic
performance has centered on concrete nouns (e.g., Cree & McRae,
2003; Garrard et al., 2001; McRae, de Sa, & Seidenberg, 1997), some
researchers have also investigated the role of features in verbs (e.g.,
Bird, Howard, & Franklin, 2000; Miller & Fellbaum, 1991; Parris &
Weekes, 2001; Vigliocco, Vinson, Damian, & Levelt, 2002; Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis, & Garrett, 2004; Vinson & Vigliocco, 2002;
Vinson, Vigliocco, Cappa, & Siri, 2003). The present research extends this previous work in two ways. First, we examined whether
the general feature-based framework can account for verb performance in AD by testing a main prediction of this framework -
graceful degradation (i.e., the gradual loss of function). Second,
we tested the predictions of several specific feature-based models
by comparing patients' performance with nouns and verbs from
different semantic domains. We discuss each of these in turn.
A hallmark characteristic of the distributed feature-based
framework is that it predicts graceful degradation, rather than
complete dysfunction, as a result of small amounts of damage to
the conceptual system. Graceful degradation occurs in this framework as a result of gradual loss of connections between features
and the concepts which they represent, mirroring the likely neurodegenerative effect of AD (Farah & McClelland, 1991). With the
progression of the disease, the number of available semantic features gradually decreases. As a result, differences between concepts diminish, even though the gross structure of semantic
categories may remain largely intact initially (Aronoff et al.,
2006). Thus, graceful degradation means that AD patients' performance on semantic tasks looks similar to unimpaired performance,
except that it's poorer overall. The general preservation of semantic category structure at the initial stages of disease progression
has been previously shown for nouns (Aronoff et al., 2006; Bonilla
& Johnson, 1995; Ober & Shenaut, 1999), but no similar evidence
currently exists for verbs. Because nouns and verbs differ in a variety of ways, their susceptibility to damage may be different. While
concrete nouns tend to refer to individuated referents, verbs tend
to describe relations (e.g., Gentner, 1981). Their semantic representations may be more dependent on the representations of other
concepts, leading to faster breakdown of category structure. Moreover, because verb meaning is intimately connected to the syntactic structures the verb can appear in, verb impairments may appear
all-of-a-piece with the decline of grammatical ability (Grossman
et al., 1996; Kempler, Almor, Tyler, Andersen, & MacDonald,
1998). However, if the same feature-based organizational principles underlie the semantic representations of nouns and verbs,
then AD patients' verb performance should also show graceful degradation in that patients should show greater difficulty with the
same semantic categories that healthy controls find more difficult.
The first goal of the present work was to test whether, similar to
nouns, AD patients' verb performance resembles unimpaired performance, albeit at an overall lower level.
Graceful degradation also predicts consistent changes to the
pattern of errors made by patients as the disease progresses
(e.g., Bowles, Obler, & Albert, 1987; Gonnerman, Aronoff, Almor,
Kempler, & Andersen, 2004; Hodges, Graham, & Patterson, 1995).
This process occurs in the following way: When all the connections between features and the concepts they represent are intact, accuracy is expected to be high. With mild damage to
these connections, most knowledge will be preserved, but if a

9

distinguishing feature is affected then contrast coordinate errors
may occur (e.g., saying dog for cat). Increasing damage will affect
more distinguishing features which will likely result in a substantial loss of knowledge about specific concepts, reflected in
a high number of super-ordinate errors (e.g., saying animal for
cat). More extensive damage will lead to the loss of even general
knowledge about concepts, which will likely be reflected in the
occurrence of cross-category errors (e.g., saying pear for cat). Finally, with massive damage to the connections in the featural
system, loss of knowledge of entire semantic categories may occur, resulting in the complete loss of naming ability for concepts
from these categories, and leading to many do not know responses. Although the general pattern of noun naming errors
exhibited by patients appears to support this prediction (Bowles
et al., 1987; Gonnerman et al., 2004; Hodges et al., 1995), it is
yet unclear whether the same error progression would also occur with verbs. Verb performance may not exhibit the same pattern of errors, given the conceptual differences between nouns
and verbs (Gentner, 1981) and their differing syntactic roles
(Grossman et al., 1996). However, if the same feature-based
organizational principles underlie the semantic representation
of nouns and verbs then verb naming errors should show similar
patterns to nouns. The second specific goal of the present work
was to test this prediction.
So far, we focused on whether verb performance in AD, at least
for imageable verbs, could be explained in a feature-based framework on the basis of general mechanisms that are similar to the
ones previously used to explain noun performance. We now turn
to address the question of whether verb performance in AD may
in fact show that verbs and nouns are represented in a single feature-based system. The general feature-based approach does not
necessarily entail shared representations for nouns and verbs,
and different researchers working in this framework have taken
different positions about this issue. For example, in research on
general models of semantic memory, Miller and Fellbaum (1991)
described a feature-based network model in which nouns and
verbs are represented separately, but Vigliocco et al. (2004) modeled the semantic representation of objects and actions within a
single unitary feature-based system.
In the context of semantic impairments, Bird et al. (2000) proposed a model of semantic impairments in which nouns and verbs
are represented in a single unitary feature-based semantic system.
Following Warrington and McCarthy's (1987) and Warrington and
Shallice's (1984) seminal work on nouns, Bird, Howard, and Franklin argued that verbs are similar to non-living nouns, in that they
rely on a relatively low proportion of sensory to functional features. Their model predicts an association between performance
with non-living nouns and verbs, which they confirmed by testing
a small group of patients with aphasia. Parris and Weekes (2001)
extended this approach to predict an association between performance with nouns and performance with instrument verbs, which
encode a typical instrument as part of their core meaning (e.g.,
sweeping). In support of their model, Parris and Weekes described
an anomic patient with dementia who showed worse performance
with nouns than with verbs, but also a more subtle category specific verb deficit, with instrumental verbs being more impaired
than non-instrumental verbs.
A plausible extension of this model is that, due to the importance of instrument information for the semantic representation
of instrument verbs, coupled with the fact that those instruments
tend to belong to non-living noun categories, semantic performance with instrument verbs would be associated with non-living
noun performance more than with living nouns performance.
Although Parris and Weekes (2001) acknowledged this implication
of their model, the single patient that they tested was completely
impaired with all nouns, and they were therefore unable to test

10

A. Almor et al. / Brain & Language 111 (2009) 8-19

this prediction directly. Here we tested this prediction of the Parris
and Weekes model by comparing instrument verb performance
and relative non-living and living noun performance in a group
of AD patients with various levels of impairment. Following the
same logic, we reasoned that performance with verbs that rely
on sensory information would be associated with performance
with nouns that describe living things more than with nouns that
describe non-living things. We, therefore, also looked at manner
verbs whose meaning encodes the manner of the action they describe (e.g., run, skip, and walk), which, by some accounts (Marshall, Chiat, Robson, & Pring, 1996; Marshall, Pring, Chiat, &
Robson, 1996), is primarily sensory (e.g., hquick movementi is a
perceptual/visual feature that distinguishes running from walking).
Under this view, the Bird, Howard, and Franklin, and Parris and
Weekes models should predict a stronger association between performance with manner verbs and living nouns.
In addition to the distinction between sensory and functional
features, some researchers also consider the likelihood with which
features co-occur in the representation of different concepts (feature inter-correlation; e.g., animals that hhave a beaki tend to also
hflyi) as an important predictor of semantic impairments (Devlin
et al., 1998; Gonnerman et al., 1997; Moss, Tyler, & Jennings,
1997). Garrard et al. (2001) and McRae et al. (1997) analyzed differences in the prevalence of inter-correlated features in different
semantic noun categories and found that living noun categories
had more inter-correlated features than non-living categories.
Due to the differences in the number and type of inter-correlated
features in different domains, several researchers have used feature inter-correlation to explain domain-specific deficits with
nouns. Gonnerman et al. (1997) argued that the semantic representation of living things is protected from small amounts of damage by the high prevalence of feature inter-correlation. If one
feature in an inter-correlated cluster is damaged, the rest of the
features in the cluster can still lead to sufficient activation of the
concept. In contrast, because non-living concepts tend to depend
on idiosyncratic features, damage to one feature is more likely to
impair performance with any non-living concept that relies on that
feature. Moss et al. (1997) applied a similar logic but also differentiated between distinctive and shared features. They noted that
distinctive features tend to appear in inter-correlated clusters
more often in the representation of non-living nouns, for which
shape and function are often related than in the representation
of living things, for which distinguishing features tend to be
idiosyncratic.
According to both approaches, a small amount of damage would
mostly affect concepts with idiosyncratic features and few intercorrelated features, but more excessive damage would affect entire
feature clusters and therefore impair entire groups of concepts that
share these clusters. Consequently, both approaches predict a relation between the amount of damage to the semantic system and
relative performance with concepts from different semantic domains. However, the two approaches differ in which semantic domain they predict would be more affected by small and large
amounts of damage to the semantic system. The Gonnerman
et al. approach predicts that with small amounts of damage to
the semantic system, non-living nouns would be more impaired
than living nouns and that later in the disease this pattern would
switch. Moss, Tyler, and Jenkins make exactly the opposite
prediction.
Because the role of feature inter-correlation is a matter of debate, and because most of the empirical work in this area has not
considered verb performance, it is important to test empirically
whether the relation between features can explain performance
patterns in both nouns and verbs. Thus, the third and final specific
goal of this work was to test predictions of specific feature-based
accounts. Accounts based on the sensory-functional distinction

predict an association between patients' relative performance with
nouns vs. verbs and (a) their relative performance with non-living
vs. living nouns, and (b) their relative performance with instrument vs. manner verbs. Accounts that are based on feature intercorrelation predict an association between patients' naming accuracy and (a) their relative impairment with non-living vs. living
nouns, and (b) their relative impairment with instrument vs. manner verbs.
To summarize, the present research addressed three main
questions:
1. Is verb performance in AD compatible with graceful degradation in a general feature-based framework such that relative
levels of naming performance are preserved across different
categories?
2. Is verb performance in AD compatible with graceful degradation in a general feature-based framework in terms of error
pattern progression (i.e., super-ordinate errors ? contrast
coordinate errors ? cross-category errors ? ``do not know"
errors)?
3. Do patterns of noun and verb category impairments support the
sensory-functional models of Bird et al. (2000), and Parris and
Weekes (2001), and/or the feature inter-correlation models of
Gonnerman et al. (1997) or Tyler and Moss (2001)?
We addressed these questions using a timed picture naming
task because this task has been used to successfully assess lexical
semantic performance in AD patients (e.g., Gonnerman et al.,
1997). The relative simplicity of this task allowed us to employ
a much larger set of stimuli than would have been possible with
more complex stimuli such as animations. Because response
times are not likely to show ceiling effects in the same way as
accuracy scores, we also measured naming latencies (Druks
et al., 2006). The pictures were selected from six non-living noun
categories, six living noun categories, six instrument verb categories, and six manner verb categories. Throughout the rest of this
paper we shall use the term ``semantic domain" to distinguish between living and non-living objects and between instrument and
manner verbs. We shall use the term ``semantic category" to refer
to individual categories such as ``zoo animals" or ``vehicle motion"
verbs. We shall also use the term ``word class" to distinguish between nouns and verbs. To ensure sufficient performance variability and avoid ceiling effects, pictures varied in naming
difficulty and included pictures which pilot data indicated were
difficult to name.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Fourteen patients with AD and fourteen healthy elderly normal controls (EN) participated in this study. Table 1 shows participants' demographic and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores.
The two groups were matched for age, t(13) = 1.6, n.s., and years
of education, t(13) = 1.68, n.s., but the patients had lower MMSE
scores, t(13) = 1.6, p < .001. Participants were paid for their participation. The AD patients were diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al.,
1984). Results of neurological, laboratory (including computer
tomography or magnetic resonance scan), and neuropsychological
assessment failed to suggest other causes of dementia. All participants were native speakers of standard American English. All
recruitment, informed consent, and testing procedures were
approved by the University of Southern California's Institutional
Review Board (IRB).

2.2. Materials
2.2.1. Nouns
One hundred and forty-four nouns describing depictable objects
from six living and six non-living categories (12 nouns from each
category) were selected. The living and non-living nouns were
matched for mean word frequency (Francis & Kucera, 1982) and
familiarity. Familiarity scores were taken from both the Snodgrass
(Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980) and the MRC database (Wilson,
1988). The ratings from each source were first z transformed in order to bring the ratings from both sources to a uniform scale. For
nouns that had ratings in both sources, the average of the two z
scores was used as the familiarity score for that noun. For nouns
that had a familiarity rating in only one source, the z transformed
rating of that score was used instead. The list of all nouns appears
in Appendix A. A matching color picture was then selected for each
noun from various print and on-line sources, or photographed and
edited to yield a clearly identifiable picture of the object on a white
background at an 800  600 screen resolution.
2.2.2. Verbs
Ninety-six verbs from six manner and six instrument categories (eight verbs from each category) were selected based on Levin's (1993) classification. As with the nouns, the manner and
instrument verbs were matched for word frequency (Francis &
Kucera, 1982). Because we were unable to find published familiarity ratings for most of our verbs, we collected familiarity ratings from 67 University of Southern California undergraduates
recruited through the Psychology Department's participant pool.
Participants were asked to rate how familiar they thought the action described by each verb was on a scale from 1 to 7 (with seven being the most familiar). The familiarity of the instrument
verbs, M = 5.88, SD = .61, did not differ from the familiarity of

manner verbs, M = 5.94, SD = .6, t(47) = .52, n.s. Because different
verbs can vary in how imageable they are (much more so than
the concrete nouns we used) and because imageability can affect
picture naming performance, we wanted to ensure that the
instrument and manner verbs we selected did not differ in
imageability. We therefore ran an imageability rating study in
which 30 different undergraduate participants from the University of Southern California Psychology Department participant
pool rated the imageability of the different verbs on a scale from
one to seven with seven being most imageable. The imageability
of the instrument verbs, M = 5.01, SD = .81, was not different than
the imageability of the manner verbs, M = 4.78, SD = .67,
t(47) = 1.49, n.s. The list of all verbs can be found in Appendix
B. Color pictures were selected and prepared similar to the
nouns.
In choosing the concepts for the naming task, our goal was to
use items that were namable, but would minimize any ceiling effect for the control subjects. Twenty five paid young participants
(ages 17-27, mean: 20.2) recruited through bulletin board advertisements named all the nouns and verbs based on the pictures
used in the experiment. Noun categories ranged in accuracy from
73% to 95% (mean = 86%) and verb categories ranged in accuracy
from 73% to 96% (mean = 82%). Naming agreement was also calculated for the norming data as the number of intended target responses divided by the number of semantically correct responses,
which included, in addition to the intended target responses, synonyms, and expressions that had greater detail than the target (i.e.,
subordinate). Overall naming agreement was high: 87% for verbs
and 90% for nouns. Given that age of acquisition has been recently
shown to be an important factor in explaining naming performance in AD we had ninety nine University of South Carolina
undergraduate students rate the age of acquisition of our stimuli
following the procedure of Gilhooly and Gilhooly (1980). The

12

A. Almor et al. / Brain & Language 111 (2009) 8-19

nouns and the verbs in our study were both rated as having the
same average age of acquisition of 4.5 years.
2.3. Procedure
The object and action naming tasks were conducted in separate
sessions at least two weeks apart. Half of the participants from
each group performed the verb naming task first and the other half
performed the noun naming task first. To minimize order related
confounds we used two random orderings of the stimuli for each
task and tested half of the participants from each group with each
ordering. Stimuli presentation and response recording were controlled by an Apple Powerbook G3 computer running Psyscope
1.1 (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993) with a PSI button
box. The testing session was also audio taped for later verification
and transcription. All testing was conducted in a quiet room at participants' home, nursing home, or the University of Southern California's campus.
Each task started with instructions followed by a short practice
block. The experimenter verified that all participants understood
the task before they started the actual experiment. Participants
were instructed to name the pictures as quickly and accurately
as they could. In the noun task, they were instructed to name the
object presented on the screen and in the verb task they were
asked to name the action shown using a verb in the -ing form. A
voice key was used to record the latency between the onset of
the picture on the screen and the initiation of vocal response.
The picture was removed from the display when a response was
detected by the voice key. Participants received no feedback during
the experiment.
Responses were transcribed by the experimenter during the
experiment and were verified using the audio tapes after the
experiment. Responses were then coded using the following criteria (see Table 2 for summary and examples). A response that was
either the target word, a synonym of the target word, or a subordinate term of the target word was coded as ``correct". Incorrect responses that were semantically related to the target were classified
into ``contrast coordinate", ``super-ordinate", and ``other" errors.
The ``other" category consisted of responses that were somehow
semantically related to the target but did not fall into any of the
previous categories. Incorrect responses that were not semantically related to the target were classified as ``cross-category" responses, and responses that correctly described an unintended
aspect of the target picture were coded as ``alternates" and together with trials in which equipment error prevented stimulus

presentation were dropped from further analyses. When participants indicated not being able to name the picture their response
was coded as ``do not know." In addition to the naming task, all
participants also completed the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE;
Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975).
Due to equipment malfunction, noun naming latencies from
one AD patient were not properly recorded and were therefore
not included in the response time analyses.
Because our stimuli were deliberately chosen to avoid ceiling
effects with the healthy control participants, we did not expect
the healthy control participants to name all the pictures correctly
(see Table 1 for individual participants' performance). Therefore,
to assess patients' impairment, it was important to assess their
performance in relation to the performance of the control participants. To this end, we calculated impairment scores for the
patients that were based on the difference between each patient's
performance and the mean performance of the EN group, divided
by the mean performance of the EN group. The purpose of dividing
by the mean performance of the EN group was to ensure that the
different impairment measures had the same scale. For example,
a patient's ``noun accuracy impairment score" was calculated as
follows:

Noun accuracyEN  Noun accuracypatient
Noun accuracyEN
Similar formulae were used to calculate for each patient an
accuracy impairment score for verbs, living nouns, non-living
nouns, manner verbs, and instrument verbs. In order to assess several relative impairments, we also calculated for each participant
three impairment difference scores. For example, a patient's
``noun-verb" accuracy impairment difference score was calculated
by:
Noun accuracy impairment scorepatient  Verb accuracy impairment scorepatient

Living-non-living and manner-instrument impairment difference scores were calculated similarly. We also calculated impairment scores for all the latency measures but because these
latency impairment scores yielded no significant effects in any of
the analyses we don't report them.

naming accuracy for nouns and verbs in the two groups (Fig. 1a).
Accuracy data were analyzed once with participants as a random
factor (F1) and once with items as a random factor (F2). The participants analysis used a mixed design ANOVA with Group (EN, AD) as
a between factor and Word Class (Noun, Verb) as a within factor.
The items analysis used a mixed design ANOVA with Group as a
within factor and Word Class as a between factor (unless noted
otherwise, all the subsequent analyses we report in this paper followed a similar format). These analyses found a significant effect of
group with healthy controls responding more accurately than the
patients, F1(1, 26) = 13.83, p < .001, F2(1, 237) = 296.10, p < .001,
a significant effect of word class with nouns named more accurately than verbs, F1(1, 26) = 304.99, p < .001, F2(1, 238) = 22.63,
p < .001, and no interaction between group and word class, F1(1,
26) = 2.86, n.s., F2 < 1. Thus, although patients were more impaired
than healthy controls in naming both nouns and verbs, they were
not disproportionately impaired with verbs.

ment scores, and their MMSE, age, education, and overall accuracy.
We used Rom's method (Rom, 1990) to control for family wise error. We found that patients' noun-verb accuracy scores were
strongly correlated with age such that older age was linked with
a more pronounced verb deficit, r = .72, t(13) = 3.47, p < .05
(Fig. 2). No other correlation was significant. We calculated the
same correlations for patients' noun-verb latency impairment
scores but found no significant or close to significant correlations.
We also calculated the correlations between the noun and verb
performance MMSE, age, education, and overall level of performance for the EN group but found no significant or close to significant correlations.
Thus, our results show that if there are differences between the
effects of AD on verbs and on nouns, these differences are subtle
and appear related to the catalyzing effect AD may have in making
age effects more easily discernable. We now turn to address the
three questions.

3.1. Noun vs. verb RT

1. Is verb performance in AD compatible with graceful degradation in a general feature-based framework in terms of the general preservation of unimpaired category structure?

The latencies of correct naming responses (Fig. 1b) were analyzed similarly to the accuracy data. To reduce the effect of outliers,
in this and all subsequent response time analyses, participant median correct response times were used for the participant analyses
and item median correct response times were used for the item
analyses (Ratcliff, 1993). Twelve verb items and eleven noun items
with one or less RT data point from any group (due to naming error
or equipment problems) were excluded from these analyses. As in
the accuracy analyses, the response time analyses found a significant effect of group with patients responding slower than the EN
group, F1(1, 25) = 5.55, p < .03, F2(1, 215) = 79.39, p < .001, a significant effect of word class with nouns named more quickly than
verbs, F1(1, 23) = 46.90, p < .001, F2(1, 215) = 31.50, p < .001, and
a marginally significant interaction between group and word class
in the participants analysis but not the items analysis, F1(1,
37) = 4.09, p < .06, F2(1, 215) = 1.91, n.s. The response time analyses therefore corroborate the accuracy analyses in showing a robust overall impairment in AD patients but no strong evidence
for disproportionate verb impairment in the patients. We next consider the possibility that this trend failed to achieve statistical significance due to variability among the patients related to the state
of their disease or other personal characteristic.
3.2. Noun, verbs, and participant characteristics

Given that AD affects both noun and verb naming, we wanted
to ascertain whether AD patients' impaired performance resembles unimpaired performance at an individual semantic category
level. Fig. 3 shows both groups' naming accuracy and correct response latency for individual noun and verb categories. To quantitatively assess the similarity in relative category performance,
we calculated the correlations between the average performance
of the AD and EN groups for the 12 noun categories and for the
12 verb categories. The two groups' naming accuracy for different
semantic categories were strongly correlated for both nouns,
r = .82, t(11) = 4.6, p < .001, and verbs, r = .84, t(11) = 4.80,
p < .001, and the difference between these correlations was not
statistically significant, Fisher's Z = .14, n.s. Similarly, the two
groups' correct response latencies for different semantic categories were also correlated for both nouns, r = .72, t(11) = 3.24,
p < .01, and verbs, r = .88, t(11) = 5.86, p < .001, and the difference
between these correlations was not statistically significant, Fisher's Z = .99, n.s. These analyses therefore reveal that for both
nouns and verbs, patients' relative naming of pictures from the
various semantic categories paralleled unimpaired naming performance. This shows that for both nouns and verbs, AD results in
graceful degradation.

To test whether other patient characteristic affected the patients' relative performance with nouns and verbs we calculated
the correlations between participants' noun-verb accuracy impair-

2. Is verb performance in AD compatible with graceful degradation in a general feature-based framework in terms of error pattern progression?

difference scores.

To test whether, for both nouns and verbs, naming errors progress from contrast coordinate to super-ordinate to cross-category
and finally to ``do not know" responses, we compared the number
of each of the four error types in the two populations for nouns and
verbs. We did not include the ``other" errors in these analyses because responses in this category could not be clearly classified by
semantic specificity. We calculated error percentages for each participant by dividing the number of errors of each type made by the
participant by the total number of errors from the four types he or
she made. This calculation was done separately for nouns and for
verbs. Fig. 4 shows the mean percentages for both groups in naming noun and verb pictures. As is evident in the figure, error patterns showed the predicted shift for both nouns and verbs. To
ascertain whether this shift in error distribution was statistically
significant we rank ordered the errors (contrast coordinate = 1,
super-ordinate = 2, cross-category = 3, do not know = 4) and used
the Brunner-Munzel test (Brunner & Munzel, 2000) to compare
the ranking of the errors made by the two groups. The ranking of

groups and not as indicating an underlying continuous scale. Error bars show the standard error of the mean.

errors was higher for the AD patients than for the EN group for
both nouns, Brunner-Munzel Statistic (693.5) = 3.54, p < .001, and
verbs, Brunner-Munzel Statistic (542.8) = 2.30, p < .03.
To further test whether poorer naming performance in the patients is associated with the predicted shift in error progression,
we used a median split based on overall accuracy to divide the AD
group into a high performing and low performing group. This was
done separately for nouns and verbs. The relative error percentages
of these two groups are shown in Fig. 4c for nouns and in Fig. 4d for
verbs. We again used the Brunner-Munzel procedure to test
whether the two patient groups significantly differed in their error
distribution. Again, the ranking of errors was higher for the low performing AD patients than for the high performing ones for both
nouns, Brunner-Munzel Statistic (371.5) = 5.69, p < .001, and verbs,
Brunner-Munzel Statistic (347.2) = 4.49, p < .001.
Thus, the general trend of changes in the error distribution was
compatible with graceful degradation as predicted by the featurebased framework. At this point we can therefore conclude that a feature-based framework is generally compatible with both noun and

verb performance in AD. Our next analyses aimed to test several specific proposals about the organization of feature-based systems.
3. Do patterns of noun and verb category impairments support the
sensory-functional models of Bird et al. (2000), and Parris and
Weekes (2001), and/or the feature inter-correlation models of
Gonnerman et al. (1997) and Tyler and Moss (2001)?
To test whether patients showed domain-specific deficits in line
with these theoretical accounts, we compared accuracy for living
and non-living nouns and for manner and instrument verbs
(Fig. 5). We initially analyzed the noun data and verb data separately. In both cases, the participants analyses used a mixed design
ANOVA with Group (EN, AD) as a between factor, and Semantic Domain (living vs. non-living for nouns and manner vs. instrument for
verbs) as a within factor. The items analyses used a mixed design
ANOVA with Group as a within factor and Semantic Domain as a
between factor. We also conducted similar analyses of correct
naming latencies but because these analyses did not find any sig-

nificant effects except for the overall slower responses of the patients we do not report them.
For nouns, these analyses found a significant effect of group
with patients responding less accurately than controls, F1(1,
26) = 11.08, p < .003, F2(1, 141) = 186.254, p < .001, an effect of
semantic domain with more accurate naming of non-living than
living nouns that was only significant by participants, F1(1,
26) = 12.62, p < .002, F2(1, 141) = 1.49, n.s., and an interaction between group and semantic domain that was significant by participants and marginally significant by items, F1(1, 26) = 7.67, p < .02,
F2(1, 141) = 4.15, p < .07. Tukey HSD post hoc tests indicated that
the non-living nouns were named more accurately than the living
nouns by the AD group, p < .001, but no significant difference was
found for the EN group, p > .9. These analyses indicate that patients
showed a disproportionate impairment for living nouns.
For verbs, these analyses found a significant effect of group
with patients responding less accurately than controls, F1(1,
26) = 15.81, p < .001, F2(1, 94) = 122.66, p < .001, an effect of
semantic domain with instrument verbs named more accurately
than manner verbs that was only significant by participants but
not by items, F1(1, 26) = 6.10, p < .03, F2(1, 94) = 1.68, n.s., and
an interaction between group and semantic domain that was significant by participants but not by items, F1(1, 26) = 4.27, p < .05,
F2(1, 94) = 1.33, n.s. Tukey HSD post hoc tests indicated that the
difference between naming accuracy for manner and instrument
verbs was significant for the EN group, p < .02 (with instrument
verbs named more accurately than manner verbs), but not for
the AD group, p > .9. These analyses show that patients exhibited
a disproportionate impairment for instrument verbs. However,
the differences between the participant and items analyses for
verbs indicate considerable variability among the verbs in each
semantic domain.
Overall, these results indicate that, as a group, the AD participants showed a domain-specific deficit for living nouns and for
instrument verbs. Together with the analyses that showed that
our patients do not have a disproportionate verb impairment, these
results argue against Bird, Howard, and Franklin's (2000) general
suggestion that artifact and verb impairments are linked, and with
Parris and Weekes's (2001) more specific claim about associations
between non-living nouns and instrument verbs. However, analyzing mean group performance may be inadequate for testing the
claims of these models because the group means do not reflect
individual patterns of impairment that may be consistent with
these views, but, when averaged, may contradict them. Our final
set of analyses therefore tested the predictions of the different feature-based theories by examining specific associations between
naming performance of nouns and verbs from different domains
in individual patients.
3.3. Bird et al. (2000)
In order to test the relation this view predicts between noun-
verb and living-non-living noun impairments, we calculated the
correlation between the respective impairment accuracy scores.
In support of the Bird, Howard and Franklin approach, we found
that patients' noun-verb impairment accuracy impairment scores
were significantly correlated with their living-non-living impairment accuracy scores, such that better accuracy with nouns relative to verbs was associated with better accuracy with living
relative to non-living nouns, r = .54, t(13) = 2.2, p < .05 (see Fig. 6).
3.4. Parris and Weekes's (2001)
To test whether, as this view predicts, better performance with
instrument verbs vs. manner verbs is linked to better noun performance we examined the correlation between patients' manner-

Fig. 6. The relation between AD patients' noun-verb and living-non-living accuracy impairment difference scores.

instrument impairment difference scores and their noun accuracy.
This correlation was significant, r = .57, t(13) = 2.43, p < .04, such
that a more pronounced impairment with instrument than with
manner verbs was associated with worse noun naming accuracy,
therefore supporting the core claim of this model (see Fig. 7a). To
test whether the extension of this model to an association between
relative living-non-living noun impairment and relative manner-
instrument verb impairment, we examined the correlation between the respective impairment accuracy scores. We found no
significant correlation between the two impairment scores,
r = .36, t(13) = 1.32, n.s. Thus, our results support the core claim
of the Parris and Weekes model about the differential importance
of object knowledge in different verb categories but fail to support
the extension of the model to more specific relations between nonliving nouns and instrument verbs.
3.5. Gonnerman et al. (1997) and Tyler and Moss (2001)
To test whether, in line with these approaches, overall accuracy was associated with systematic changes in relative domain
performance in nouns, we examined the correlation between
patients' noun naming accuracy and their living-non-living
impairment difference scores. This correlation was significant,
r = .56, t(13) = 2.34, p < .04, such that worse noun naming
accuracy was associated with a more pronounced impairment
with living than with non-living nouns (Fig. 7b). This result is
compatible with the Gonnerman et al. (1997) view, but is contrary to the predictions of Tyler and Moss (2001). In order to
examine whether domain-specific performance in verbs shows
a similar pattern, we examined the correlation between patients' average verb performance and their manner-instrument
impairment difference scores but found that this correlation
was not significant, r = .42, t(13) = 1.6, n.s. Thus, while feature
inter-correlation may be an important factor in relative impairment to living and non-living nouns, we found no indication
that it plays a similar role in the relative impairment to manner
and instrument verbs.
4. General discussion
By using a large set of items that varied in difficulty, we were
able to examine noun and verb performance in both healthy control participants and patients with AD in a manner that minimized
ceiling effects in the healthy control group and floor effects in the
AD group. As expected, AD patients' naming difficulties resulted in

lower accuracy and longer naming latencies than the healthy control participants across all conditions. Although the AD patients in
our study demonstrated worse performance for verb than noun
naming, the overall magnitude of our patients' deficit was comparable for nouns and verbs. If there were any differences in the extent of impairment for the two word classes, these differences
were subtle and likely related to the effect of age, which the disease may have amplified.
Our first question was whether verb performance in AD is compatible with graceful degradation of connections between features
and concepts in a general feature-based framework in terms of the
general preservation of unimpaired category structure. Our analyses demonstrated a reliable correlation between the performance
of the two groups across categories, for both nouns and verbs. This
suggests that many of the factors that affected naming accuracy for
the EN group were still influential in the AD naming performance.
This, along with the patients' above-floor performance, also suggests that the semantic system in the AD patients has retained a
basic level of knowledge about the concepts tested. This is consistent with results from other tasks performed by this patient group
(Aronoff et al., 2006) that demonstrated graceful degradation with
nouns. These findings indicate that naming deficits represent a
partial rather than complete loss of information about concepts.
Thus, the answer to our first question is that verb performance in
AD shows graceful degradation that is compatible with a general
feature-based framework in terms of the general preservation of
unimpaired category structure.
Our second question was whether verb performance in AD is
compatible with graceful degradation of connections between features and concepts in a general feature-based framework in terms
of error pattern progression. The general feature-based approach
predicts that with increased semantic damage, the dominant error
type will shift from contrast coordinate errors to super-ordinate errors to cross-category errors, and finally to ``do not know" errors
(Hodges et al., 1995). We found that, across nouns and verbs, there
was a shift in error types in the predicted direction when comparing the EN group to the AD group, and when comparing high performing AD patients to low performing AD patients. Our results
extend previous reports of error pattern distribution for nouns
(e.g., Hodges et al., 1995) to verbs and therefore indicate that the
semantic representation of both concrete nouns and imageable
verbs can be explained on the basis of distributed feature-based
representations. Thus, the answer to our second question is that er-

ror pattern progression with both nouns and verbs is indeed compatible with a general feature-based framework.
Our third and final question was whether patterns of noun and
verb domain impairments would support the sensory-functional
models of Bird et al. (2000), and Parris and Weekes (2001), and/
or the feature inter-correlation models of Gonnerman et al.
(1997) or Tyler and Moss (2001). As a group, the patients appeared
more impaired on living nouns and instrument verbs, but did not
show strong selective impairments with verbs vs. nouns. This finding appears to argue against the claims of Bird et al. (2000), who
argued for an association between verbs and non-living nouns,
and Parris and Weekes (2001) who argued for an association between instrument verbs and nouns. However, in contrast to the
mean group comparisons, the results of the correlational analyses
showed patterns compatible with the predictions of both these
models. In line with Bird, Howard, and Franklin's (2000) model,
better accuracy with nouns relative to verbs was associated with
better accuracy with living relative to non-living nouns, and in line
with Parris and Weeks's (2001) model, better noun accuracy was
associated with better accuracy with instrument verbs than with
manner verbs. Although these data are compatible with the models
of Bird et al. (2000) and of Parris and Weeks (2001), one aspect of
our data is not compatible with these approaches: if manner verbs
do indeed rely on sensory features more than instrument verbs
(Marshall, Chiat, et al., 1996) then manner verbs should have patterned with living nouns more than instrument verbs, but they did
not.
According to theories that emphasize feature inter-correlation,
disease progression should have a predictable and differential effect on domain-specific deficits. According to Gonnerman et al.
(1997), because the representation of living nouns relies on more
inter-correlated features than the representation of non-living
nouns, small amounts of damage should lead to a mild domainspecific impairment with non-living nouns whereas large amounts
of damage should lead to a pronounced domain-specific impairment with living nouns. The AD patients in our study showed domain-specific deficits for living nouns as a group, as well as a
progressive domain-specific deficit for living nouns that was associated with overall decline in noun accuracy. Our findings therefore
support the Gonnerman et al. model. Our findings provide strong
evidence against Moss, Tyler, and Jennings' (1997) claim that, because distinguishing features tend to be part of inter-correlated
feature clusters more often in the representation of non-living

18

A. Almor et al. / Brain & Language 111 (2009) 8-19

nouns than in the representation of living nouns, small amounts of
damage should lead to a mild disproportionate deficit for living
nouns but large amount of damage should lead to a strong disproportionate deficit for non-living nouns. In our patient group, there
were only two patients who showed a domain-specific impairment
for non-living nouns, and both were among the better performing
patients, arguing strongly against this theory.
While our data support the role of feature inter-correlation for
nouns, we did not find similar support for verbs. Rather than a
reflection of underlying differences in feature inter-correlation,
we believe that the instrument verb deficit we observed can be explained on the basis of the role object information plays in the
semantic representation of different verbs. Specifically, we agree
with Parris and Weekes (2001) that verbs vary systematically in
the extent to which their semantic representation overlaps with
the semantic representations of nouns. However, we disagree with
these researchers' emphasis on the distinction between sensory
and functional features. Instead, we think that instrument verbs
showed greater relation to nouns than manner verbs because object information plays a more important role in the semantic representation of instrument verbs compared to other kinds of verbs,
such as the manner verbs we used. Instrumental objects in particular are known to be activated during processing of instrumental
verbs (Ferretti, McRae, & Hatherell, 2001; Koenig, Mauner, & Bienvenue, 2003; Sussman, 2006), suggesting that information about objects may be necessary for normal processing of these verbs.
In sum, our results are generally compatible with both sensoryfunctional and inter-correlated featural models, but only some of
these models make the correct predictions. For nouns, our results
support the inter-correlated featural model of Gonnerman et al.
(1997) but not Moss, Tyler, and Jennings' (1997) model. Although
for nouns, our results are also compatible with sensory-functional
models, this distinction has been criticized in the recent literature
(Caramazza & Shelton, 1998; Cree & McRae, 2003; Shelton &
Caramazza, 1999, 2001). We therefore believe that an inter-correlated feature model is most likely to be correct.

5. Conclusion
We found strong evidence that the semantic system is governed
by an underlying featural system that operates similarly but not
identically, for noun and verb representation. Widespread damage
to this system, as is the case in Alzheimer's disease, is detectable
across the entire semantic system, along with selective and related
deficits to specific categories for both nouns and verbs. For nouns,
the faster degradation of living compared to non-living nouns is
compatible with explanations that emphasize feature inter-correlation. For verbs, we propose that the faster degradation of instrument compared to manner naming is the result of the double
requirement of object and action knowledge for instrument verb
naming.
