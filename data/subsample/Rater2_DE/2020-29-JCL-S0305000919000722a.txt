Abstract
Some theories of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) explain the linguistic deficits
observed in terms of limitations in non-linguistic cognitive systems such as working
memory. The goal of this research is to clarify the relationship between working memory
and the processing of complex sentences by exploring the performance of 28 Frenchspeaking children with DLD aged five to fourteen years and 48 typically developing
children of the same age in memory and linguistic tasks. We identified predictive
relationships between working memory and the comprehension and repetition of
complex sentences in both groups. As for syntactic measures in spontaneous language, it
is the complex spans that explain the major part of the variance in the control children.
In children with DLD, however, simple spans are predictive of these syntactic measures.
Our results thus reveal a robust relationship between working memory and syntactic
complexity, with clinical implications for the treatment of children with DLD.

Introduction
Developmental Language Disorder
Developmental Language Disorder (DLD, previously Specific Language Impairment,
SLI) is a developmental disorder which affects oral language acquisition. Children
with DLD show severe and persistent language impairment, mainly in the areas of
phonology and morphosyntax (Jakubowicz & Tuller, 2007). However, they develop
normally without showing signs of neurological damage, sensorial disabilities (such
as deafness), severe cognitive impairment, and pervasive developmental disorders
(Leonard, 1998, 2014). The term `specific', present in the previous label `SLI',
referred to the fact that the impairment was claimed to be restricted to language,
with many authors having described various syntactic deficits (see for instance
(c) Cambridge University Press 2019

Journal of Child Language

601

Parisse & Maillart, 2004, or Jakubowicz & Tuller, 2007, for reviews with Frenchspeaking children). The most frequently reported deficits are found in the processing
of sentences that show a non-canonical ordering (involving what is called `syntactic
movement'), namely sentences which differ from the French/English canonical
Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. These deficits have been observed for
different structures which all require syntactic movement and the building of a
long-distance syntactic dependency: passive clauses (Marinis & Saddy, 2013;
Montgomery & Evans, 2009; van der Lely, 1996), accusative clitics (Paradis, Crago, &
Genesee, 2003; Tuller, Delage, Monjauze, Piller, & Barthez, 2011), object relatives
(Adani, Forgiarini, Guasti, & van der Lely, 2014; Contemori & Garraffa, 2010;
Friedmann & Novogrodsky, 2004), and object questions (Jakubowicz, 2011; Marinis
& van der Lely, 2007; van der Lely, Jones, & Marshall, 2011). Children and
adolescents with DLD were also observed to produce embedded clauses relatively
infrequently (Prevost, 2009; Tuller, Henry, Sizaret, & Bathez, 2012; Zebib, Tuller,
Prevost, & Morin, 2013). This tendency differentiates their language profile from that
of L2 children who display a proportion of embedded clauses similar to that of
typically developing L1 children in spontaneous language (Scheidnes & Tuller, 2013).
The existence of such language impairment, in the presence of an intact general
cognitive system, was taken to suggest that the narrowly defined language faculty is
quite independent of the other cognitive systems (van der Lely & Marshall, 2011).
However, certain researchers have questioned the existence of a deficit strictly limited
to language in children with DLD, claiming that these children rather show
numerous deficits in other non-linguistic domains, such as general low-level
problems with auditory temporal processing (Tallal, 1976) or other non-language
impairments such as motor disorders and executive impairments (Bishop, Snowling,
Thompson, Greenhalgh, & CATALISE consortium, 2016). More generally, numerous
findings reported lower-than-expected performance on non-verbal cognition in
school-aged children and adolescents with DLD (see Tomblin & Nippold, 2014).
This is precisely one of the reasons for which the label `Specific Language
Impairment' has been replaced by `Developmental Language Disorder' (Bishop et al.,
2016). Ullman and Pierpont (2005) assert, for example, that most individuals with
DLD show an abnormal development of brain structures affecting the procedural
learning system (i.e., `Procedural Deficit Hypothesis'). This development leads to
non-language impairments in motor skills, temporal processing, and working
memory (WM). WM deficits are well known in DLD, particularly the persistent
difficulties in non-word repetition which are considered to be clinical markers of
DLD (e.g., Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Graf, Evans, & Else-Quest, 2007;
Montgomery, 2002; or for French: Thordardottir et al., 2011). Other deficits have
been identified through measures of digit and word spans (e.g., Archibald &
Gathercole, 2006; Durrleman & Delage, 2016; Hick, Botting, & Conti-Ramsden,
2005) as well through complex-span tasks assessed by dual-processing paradigms
(e.g., Archibald & Gathercole, 2007; Ellis Weismer, Evans, & Hesketh, 1999;
Hoffman & Gillam, 2004; Lukacs, Ladanyi, Fazekas, & Kemeny, 2016; McDonald,
Seidel, Hammarrlund, & Oetting, 2018; Montgomery, 2000). For Archibald and
Gathercole (2006), these various deficits are substantial and generally co-occur in
children with DLD, whereas visual WM appears to be less commonly affected.1 In a

preservation of visuospatial WM in children with DLD aged seven to eight.

more recent study, Archibald and Harder Griebeling (2016) suggest, however, that
deficits displayed by children with DLD in complex-span tasks are due to their
impairment in simple spans, notably in phonological storage. Indeed, they observed
no difference between controls and children with DLD when the level of difficulty of
the complex-span tasks was adjusted for each child's short-term memory storage
capacity.
Working memory
"Working memory involves the temporary storage and manipulation of information
that is assumed to be necessary for a wide range of complex cognitive activities"
(Baddeley, 2003, p. 189). Although it remains a subject of debate (especially by
supporters of the unitary view of working memory, such as Conway & Engle, 1994),
Baddeley and Hitch's (1974) modular tripartite working memory model is recognized
as the most influential memory model in psycholinguistics. This model contains an
attentional control system, the `central executive', which is aided by two subordinate
systems: the `phonological loop' which stores acoustic and verbal information and the
`visuospatial sketchpad' which stores visuospatial information. In 2000, a fourth
component was added to the model, the `episodic buffer', which functions as an
interface between both subordinate systems and the activation of information stored
in long-term memory; it is also controlled by the central executive which regularly
retrieves information from this buffer.
The capacity of the phonological loop is most accurately assessed by SIMPLE-SPAN
TASKS (Barrouillet & Camos, 2007). These tasks require the simple storage of verbal
information (e.g., forward digit span, word and non-word repetition). The non-word
repetition task appears to be the most frequently used in clinical practice as well as
in research. It is considered to be "a relatively pure measure of the capacity of the
component of the working memory system known as the phonological loop"
(Hansson, Sahlen, & Maki-Torkko, 2007, p. 310). Simple spans gradually improve
with age, especially between two and nine years old, and reach adult levels by
adolescence (Barouillet & Camos, 2007). The capacities of the central executive,
associated with one of the two slave subsystems, are measured with the so-called
COMPLEX-SPAN TASKS, which require storage and simultaneous processing such as
reading sentences, counting collections, or even solving arithmetic operations
(Barouillet & Camos, 2007). Backward digit span, listening span (Gaulin &
Campbell, 1994), counting span (Case, Kurland, & Goldberg, 1982), and reading
span (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) belong to this category. In these complex-span
tasks, additional processing demands are combined with the capacity of
remembering a list of items (see Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge, & Wearing, 2004;
La Pointe & Engle, 1990; Turner & Engle, 1989). Performance improvement with age
in complex spans seems to be more linear than in simple spans, which improve
more rapidly initially but then level off at about the age of nine (Barrouillet &
Camos, 2007; Siegel, 1994). Indeed, using the backward digit span, listening span,
and counting span, Gathercole et al. (2004) observed that the increase in these
complex-span tasks is linear in children aged six to fourteen years and then stabilizes
later, between the age of fourteen and fifteen years. This lengthy development of
complex spans until the end of adolescence can be linked to late cerebral maturation,
especially of regions within the frontal lobes which are involved in planning and
executive functions (Collette & van der Linden, 2002).

Working memory and syntax
As for the relationship between WM and language skills, many studies show a direct
link between WM and lexical acquisition (see Gathercole, Service, Hitch, Adams, &
Martin, 1999; Leclercq & Majerus, 2010; Majerus, Poncelet, Greffe, & van der
Linden, 2006), and more recently a link between WM and syntactic development. In
their study comparing word/non-word repetition and the production of complex
sentences in spontaneous language samples, Adams and Gathercole (2000) confirm
that children aged three to five with a more efficient phonological loop produced
longer and more complex sentences than those with less efficient WMs. Similarly,
Willis and Gathercole (2001) show that children aged four to five who displayed low
phonological loop capacities (assessed via non-word repetition and forward digit
span) repeated significantly fewer complex sentences compared to children showing
better performance in the memory tasks. Furthermore, Poll, Miller, Mainela-Arnold,
Adams, Misra, & Park (2013) found that performance in listening span predicts scores
of six- to thirteen-year-old children in a standardized task of sentence repetition. In
younger children, Dispaldro, Deevy, Altoe, Benelli, and Leonard (2011) also suggested
that results in word repetition strongly predict grammatical abilities in children aged
three to four, especially for clinical markers of DLD such as the mastery of accusative
clitics.2 For complex syntactic constructions, Bentea and Durrleman (2014) found that
WM measures (assessed by forward and backward digit span) correlated with the
comprehension of object wh-questions and relative clauses in five-year-olds. In older
children (aged seven to nine), this link was limited to the most complex constructions
involving intervention effects in the presence of two NPs, according to Rizzi's
approach to Relativized Minimality (2002) such as "Show me the ladyi that the girl is
kissing ti", as compared to simpler constructions like "Show me whoi the girl is
kissing ti". Results obtained by Engel de Abreu, Gathercole, and Martin (2011) are of
particular interest since these authors compared the role of simple and complex spans
of five-year-old children in their general language abilities. They claimed that simple
spans (assessed by forward digit span and non-word repetition) are specifically linked
to lexical capacities in children, whereas complex spans (assessed by backward digit
span and counting recall task) are strongly linked to syntactic comprehension.3 More
specifically on syntax, Montgomery, Magimairaj, and O'Malley (2008) compared the
role of simple spans (assessed by non-word repetition) and complex spans (assessed
by listening span) in the comprehension of simple and complex sentences in children
aged six to twelve. These authors observed a positive correlation between the
comprehension of complex sentences (including passives and pronominals/reflexives)
and performance on complex spans. Moreover, regression analyses revealed that the
complex spans results explain 30% of the variance in the comprehension of complex
sentences. In contrast, the comprehension of simple sentences (with SVO constructions)
did not correlate with any WM task.
As previously explained, verbal WM is clearly impaired in children with DLD.
Among various theories suggesting the role of external factors in developing
2
These personal pronouns lead to non-canonical structures in Romance languages (French or Italian, for
instance) since the object is in a preverbal position, as demonstrated in the following example in French: "il
le lave" `he him washes'.
3
Interestingly, Verhagen and Leseman (2016) found similar results in Dutch-speaking monolingual and
bilingual children aged five: simple spans significantly predicted both vocabulary and grammar, whereas
complex spans predicted only grammar.

language skills, Jakubowicz (2011) hypothesizes that these WM weaknesses limit the
ability of individuals with DLD to process complex sentences, which explains their
long-lasting immature level of grammar. This hypothesis seems to be supported by
Montgomery and Evans (2009), who found in children with DLD (aged six to
twelve) a positive correlation between WM (assessed by a complex-span task, an
adaptation of a listening span task) and the comprehension of complex sentences,
such as passives and structures containing object pronouns, that required the
children to compute a non-local dependency. On the other hand, simple spans
(assessed by non-word repetition) were correlated to simple (SVO) sentence
comprehension.4 Similarly, Frizelle and Fletcher (2015) examined the contribution of
different WM tasks (including simple and complex spans) in the repetition of
relative clauses in 35 children with DLD aged six to seven, compared to
aged-matched TD children and to language-matched ones (aged four). They found
that, for children with DLD, the ability to repeat the most complex relative clauses
(i.e., the bi-clausal ones) was related to verbal complex spans, and more precisely to
the listening span, which was not the case for simpler relative clauses. An example of
such DUAL PROPOSITIONAL relatives would be, for an object condition, "The girl ate the
sweets that you brought to the party", different from simpler PRESENTATIONAL relative
clause constructions that express a single proposition such as "There is the picture
that you drew on the wall last week". The same pattern was found in DLD children
for the more difficult types of relative clauses such as object, oblique, and indirect
object clause types. Their processing was correlated with performance on complex
spans, whereas that of simpler structures (i.e., intransitive subject relatives) was
related to simple spans. Such relationships were not found in control children in
which verbal simple spans (digit recall) were associated with relative clauses,
regardless of complexity. This suggests that children with DLD rely on complex WM
(assessed by complex-span tasks) for repeating complex syntactic structures, whereas
typically developing children only rely on passive verbal storage (assessed by
simple-span tasks) to repeat sentences for which they have a sufficient syntactic
knowledge. Still on the subject of DLD, Robertson and Joanisse (2010) evaluated
spoken sentence comprehension, including subject and object relatives, in 14
English-speaking children with DLD (M age = 10;4) in a task in which difficulty
increases with increasing working memory loads.5 They found that children
performed less accurately than age-matched controls in this task and that general
performance decreased when memory load increased. Moreover, a significant
correlation between non-word repetition and overall sentence comprehension was
also reported in the most demanding memory-load conditions, suggesting that
sentence comprehension was associated with simple storage capacity. Durrleman
and Delage (2016) also found a significant positive correlation between the
production of third person accusative clitics and WM measures, more precisely
on backward digit span, in 22 individuals with DLD aged five to sixteen.
4

Montgomery, Gillam, and Evans (2016) recently argued for a working memory-based account to
explain these relationships, with WM limitations being directly associated with poor (simple and
complex) sentence comprehension in DLD (see also Gillam, Montgomery, Gillam, & Evans, 2017, for
an overview).
5
Memory load was increased in a comprehension task using a picture selection task, with pictures
appearing either from the onset of sentence presentation, immediately after the sentence, or three
seconds after.

Interestingly, this correlation was obtained after controlling for non-verbal
reasoning, thus supporting the existence of a specific relationship between
complex syntax and complex working memory capacities. This perspective gains
further empirical support from studies by Marinis and Saddy (2013) and Weismer,
Davidson, Gangopadhyay, Sindberg, Roebuck, and Kaushanskaya (2017). The first set
of authors indeed showed a correlation between the processing of passives and
working memory abilities as measured by a listening recall task in 25 children with
DLD (M age = 7). Still using a complex WM task (visual N-back), Weismer and
colleagues (2017) found that WM performance predicts results in a grammatical
judgment task, including omissions of verbal inflexions in complex sentences, in 30
children with language impairment (including participants with DLD and autism
spectrum disorders; M age = 9;8). Finally, in a more recent study, Montgomery,
Evans, Fargo, Schwartz, and Gillam (2018) found that complex working memory
(assessed by two tasks involving concurrent processing and storage) mediates
complex sentence comprehension (non-canonical sentences) in 117 children with
DLD aged seven to eleven, whereas for canonical structures, these children seem to
depend on long-term memory language knowledge.

Syntactic complexity
The studies reviewed above show that working memory capacity and the mastery of
complex syntax are linked. Jakubowicz (2005, 2011; see also Jakubowicz & Strik,
2008) attempted to quantify this so-called `complex syntax' by attributing a high
degree of syntactic complexity to certain grammatical structures. More precisely, she
assumes that the cognitive load involved in processing complex syntax depends on
the number and nature of syntactic operations necessary for sentence processing
(Jakubowicz, 2011; Jakubowicz & Tuller, 2007). Two main factors determining
syntactic complexity were thus considered:

Syntactic movement: the complexity of a sentence is related to the amount of disruption
to the canonical structure (SVO): the more syntactic movement a structure undergoes,
the more complex it is. Jakubowicz and Strik (2008; see also Jakubowicz, 2011)
applied this reasoning to the production of object questions in French:6 The less
complex structures consist of questions where the object is produced in its in situ
post-verbal position, without any movement (1), as compared to more complex
structures like object questions containing the movement of the object (2), and to the
most complex structures which are associated with subject-verb inversion7 (3). All of
these forms are grammatical in spoken French.

6
Note that van der Lely and Batell (2003) also studied object questions in English to test their RDDR
(Representational Deficit for Dependent Relations) account. They postulated that children with
grammatical DLD had optional movement, which could explain why they sometimes produced
appropriate movement operations in object questions and, on other occasions, demonstrated deficits in
both WH-operator and Q-feature movements.
7
Indeed, the possibility, in French, of proceeding to an inversion of subject-verb arguments leads to the
most complex construction, containing two instances of movement, as in (3) for object questions and (4)
for object relatives.

606

Delage and Frauenfelder

(1) tu pousses qui ?
`you push who?'
(2) qui tu pousses ?
`who you are pushing?'
(3) qui pousses-tu ?
`who are you pushing?'
This reasoning can also explain why object relative clauses with subject-verb
inversion (4), which contain two instances of syntactic movement and result in a
non-canonical word order (OVS), are more complex than object relative clauses
without such subject-verb inversion (5) but that also result in a non-canonical
word order (OSV). The latter, in turn, are more complex than subject relative
clauses (6), which respect the canonical word order (SVO).
(4) Object relative with subject-verb inversion
Le garcon que rencontre Max au cinema
[OVS order]
`The boy that meets Max at the movies': the boy who/that Max meets
(5) Object relative without subject-verb inversion
Le garcon que Max rencontre au cinema
[OSV order]
`The boy that Max meets at the movies': the boy who/that Max meets
(6) Subject relative
Le garcon qui rencontre Max au cinema
[SVO order]
`The boy who meets Max at the movies': the boy who/that meets Max
Depth of embedding: Although embedded clauses may not necessarily involve syntactic
movement, they generally involve an accumulation of syntactic operations whose
number and nature vary according to the type of embedded clauses (relative,
adverbial, or complement clauses): presence of a complementizer (e.g., que `that'),
additional verbal inflection, or morphological tense/mood dependencies between
main and embedded clauses (Delage, 2008; Hamann & Tuller, 2014; Hamann,
Tuller, Monjauze, Delage, & Henry, 2007; Tuller, Delage, & Monjauze, 2006).
Moreover, since each operation has a processing cost, when operations add up,
complexity increases. The embedding of subordinate clauses within other embedded
clauses thus increases the cost of the syntactic processing due to its deep
embedding. The following examples describe the increasing complexity of utterances
due to an increase of syntactic operations, including multiple embedded clauses.
(7) Un cadeau !
[Non-verbal utterance]
`A gift!'
(8) Jean veut un cadeau.
[Verbal utterance]
`John wants a gift'
(9) Je pense [que Jean veut un cadeau]
[Single embedding]
`I think that John wants a gift'
(10) Vous imaginez [que je pense [que Jean veut un cadeau]] [Multiple embedding]
`You imagine that I think that John wants a gift'
Both of these syntactic aspects (movement and embedding) have been demonstrated to be
relevant at a developmental level. Indeed, young TD children, as well as children with DLD,
produce object questions with a wh-word in-situ more frequently than object questions
containing movement of the object (Jakubowicz, 2011). As for embedding, its

Journal of Child Language

607

complexity influences children's syntactic acquisition since complex utterances are indeed
mastered later in typical development. Thus, after the age of six to seven, rather than
producing new structures (for the most part mastered), children are facing a progressive
increase in the complexity of produced utterances, with a deeper degree of embedding
(Delage, 2008; Delage & Tuller, 2010; Hamann & Tuller, 2014). Therefore, Hass and
Wepman (1974), among others, underlined a significant age effect on the number of
embedded clauses measured with spontaneous language samples produced by 167
English-speaking children aged three to thirteen (see also Hamann et al., 2007; Leadholm
& Miller, 1992; Loban, 1976; Reilly, Losh, Bellugi, & Wulfeck, 2004; or Soares, 2006, who
highlighted the same progression in the complexity of produced utterances with age).
Aim and prediction of the present study
Like Jakubowicz (2005, 2011), we hypothesize a direct link between children's increased
use of complex syntax and the maturation of their working memory capacities, with the
former being predicted by WM. The syntactic complexity of certain sentences (e.g., with
embedded clauses) is assumed to place a heavy load on the child's working memory
capacities which are limited and still developing. Working memory capacity is
expected to increase through normal maturation, thus making essential resources
more available for the processing of complex structures. In atypical language
acquisition, such as in DLD, limitations in working memory persist with age and
should consequently impede the mastery of complex grammatical sentences (Delage
& Durrleman, 2018; Durrleman & Delage, 2016; Jakubowicz, 2011; Jakubowicz &
Tuller, 2007). We could imagine that, like a `bottleneck', working memory capacities
impose limits on the processing of complex sentences. This bottleneck would limit
the ability of young children and children with DLD to comprehend and produce
complex sentences. When this working memory capacity increases with age, the
necessary resources to process complex syntax become available.8
The current study aims to determine whether there is a predictive relationship
between WM capacities and the processing of complex syntax in DLD as well as in
typical development across a wide range of ages (six to fourteen). With various tasks
that assess both working memory and complex syntax, we first attempt to replicate
two results previously observed: (1) syntactic abilities and WM performance increase
with age in both groups; and (2) syntactic abilities and WM performance improve
more slowly in children with DLD, revealing severe and persistent deficits both in
syntax and WM. These two results are actually well supported by the literature (see
Jakubowicz & Tuller, 2007; Montgomery, Magimairaj, & Finney, 2010, Montgomery
et al., 2016; as well as Henry & Botting, 2017, for reviews on these topics), but need
to be confirmed in our sample. In the light of the results of previous studies (e.g.,
Montgomery & Evans, 2009; Montgomery et al., 2008), we also expect that complex
spans predict syntactic performance better than simple spans in both groups.
Until now, such a link between complex syntactic abilities and working memory in
DLD has received relatively little attention (Durrleman & Delage, 2016; Frizelle &
Fletcher, 2015; Marinis & Saddy, 2013; Montgomery & Evans, 2009; Montgomery
et al., 2018). However, the implications of the presence of such a relationship seem
8

Note, however, that in a connectionist approach (see MacDonald & Christiansen, 2002), language
experience, and particularly fluency with syntax, can also change with age, which contributes to another
way to reduce this bottleneck.

to be of the utmost importance in the understanding, as well as in the remediation, of
difficulties encountered by children with DLD.
In this study, we intend to extend the previous studies on this topic by (1)
broadening the type of WM tasks used (simple versus complex) and reducing the
role of language in these tasks; (2) broadening the type of linguistic tasks used for
syntactic assessment (e.g., production, comprehension, and repetition); (3)
broadening the types of syntactic structures examined (varying in embedding and
movement); and (4) testing the strength of the predictive relationship between
syntactic processing and WM (rather than using a correlational approach).
1. We vary verbal working memory measures, using several tasks for both simple
and complex spans. Some of these tasks do not depend upon language
representations; for example, serial order reconstruction and counting span
tasks. These tasks allow us to focus on WM components while neutralizing
any potential influence of language. This is not the case for language-based
tasks like digit span and listening span used by Montgomery and Evans (2009)
and Durrleman and Delage (2016).
2. We evaluate not only the comprehension of complex utterances (as in
Montgomery & Evans, 2009, Montgomery et al., 2018, or Marinis & Saddy,
2013, for passives), the repetition of such utterances (as in Frizelle & Fletcher,
2015), or the elicited production of a particular structure (as in Durrleman &
Delage, 2016, for clitics), but we assess the complex grammar in all these
modalities (comprehension/repetition/production). To do this, we use, for
example, elicitation tasks and analysis of spontaneous production samples
which yield different yet complementary information about children's
production of complement clauses (Steel, Rose, Eadie, & Thornton, 2013).
3. Research on syntactic complexity has often been limited to only one aspect (such
as syntactic movement, as in Durrleman & Delage, 2016) or one structure
(relatives, passives, or pronouns in studies such as Frizelle & Fletcher, 2015, or
Marinis & Saddy, 2013). Based on a more precise definition of syntactic
complexity, we include a large variety of sentences for which two factors of
syntactic complexity are manipulated: the number of syntactic movement
operations and the depth of embedding.
4. Most of the studies cited above have examined the links between working
memory and syntax by using simple correlations, an approach which cannot
provide information about the direction or causality of this relationship. That
is why, in this study, we are searching for predictive links by means of
regression analyses. Moreover, the only study (Frizelle & Fletcher, 2015) that
used regression analyses was restricted to one specific structure (relative
clauses) in one particular modality (repetition).
Method
Participants
Twenty-eight children with DLD, aged 5;0 to 14;6 (M = 8;10, SD = 2;0, 22 boys, 6 girls9)
were selected for the experiment. The majority of these participants were diagnosed by
9
This corroborates the classical prevalence stated in the literature with three boys affected for one girl
(Hulme & Snowling, 2013).

speech and language therapists working in private clinics in France or Switzerland via
standardized tests classically used in clinical practice. For seven children, the diagnosis
was performed in France by multi-disciplinary teams in specific centres (centres for
language disorders and learning disabilities). All diagnoses of these children included
syntactic deficits (with scores less than 2 standard deviations, the criterion used in
Switzerland and France to diagnose DLD, CIM 10; De La Sante, 1993), as evaluated
by standardized batteries commonly used by language therapists, such as EXALANG
5-8 (Thibault, Helloin, & Croteau, 2010), which include both expressive and
receptive assessments. Hearing status as well as articulation were checked by
specialized clinicians. At the time of the study, all participants were receiving
speech-and-language therapy. Performance of these children was compared with that
of 48 typically developing control children aged 5;2 to 12;9 (M = 9;0, SD = 2;4, 23
boys, 25 girls), recruited from local schools, who did not present any academic or
language difficulty according to their teachers and parents, and who had never
received speech or language therapy. Descriptive data on participants are given in
Tables 1 and 2, including age and gender of children and parents' education level,10
as well as, for participants with DLD, characterization of language area affected and
comorbid difficulties according to their Speech and Language Therapists (SLT).
All participants were strictly monolingual French-speaking, lived in the same border
region (including Geneva and its Swiss and French outskirts) and performed within the
normal percentile range ( 10th, which corresponds to an IQ of 80) in non-verbal
reasoning, assessed via Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (Raven, Court, & Raven,
1998). Children with DLD obtained a mean score of 27.2 (SD = 5.5) and control
children of 28.6 (SD = 6.2) for this non-verbal task. We ensured that the groups
did not differ in chronological age (t(74) = 0.3, p = .3) or in non-verbal reasoning
(t(74) = 1.0, p = .6). Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee
of the Faculty of Psychology, at the University of Geneva. Parents of the participants
gave informed, written consent for their children to participate in the research.

Material and procedure
All children were tested individually in the speech and language therapist's office (for
children with DLD) or in school (for controls). Their answers were (digitally) recorded
for subsequent transcription and coding. All testing sessions were transcribed, coded,
and checked twice by two different experts.
To assess working memory performance, we used three simple-span tasks (a-c) and
three complex-span tasks (d-f) which involve dual-processing. When the child failed two
or three times consecutively on the same task, the task was discontinued. Syntax was
evaluated in three different contexts (g-i): comprehension, repetition, and spontaneous
production of complex sentences. Finally, Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (Raven
et al., 1998) allowed us to assess the non-verbal reasoning ability of participants. Table 3
summarizes these different tasks and the measures we used for each of the tasks.

(a) Forward digit span (WISC IV; Wechsler, 2005). This task consists of orally
presenting a series of digits increasing in length from 2 to 9 to the
participants, who then have to immediately repeat them aloud in the same order
10
Performance of children did not significantly differ for this aspect (educational level) on WM or
syntax measures, whichever group (controls, DLD) or the parent (mother, father) was considered.

(b) Non-word repetition (BELEC; Mousty, Leybaert, Alegria, Content, & Morais,
1994). This task is composed of 40 non-words increasing in length (1-5
syllables) and in phonological complexity (with Consonant-Vowel and
Consonant-Vowel-Consonant structures), such as moga, jusega, kragrinblan,
panilefevu, praublifrouklebro.
(c) Word span. The `animal race task' (Majerus, 2008; Majerus et al., 2006) is a
serial order reconstruction task.11 Participants listen to a short auditory list of
animal names participating in a race; the subjects are then asked to put the
animals on the podium in their order of arrival.
(d) Backward digit span (WISC IV; Weschler, 2005). In this task, participants are
asked to repeat a series of digits in the reversed order.
(e) Counting span (Case et al., 1982). In this task, the child is presented with a
ring-binder with each page containing a different number of red and blue
dots. The child is instructed to count and remember the number of red dots,
and then, after n-pages (a number which progressively increases), he/she has
to recall, in the order of presentation, the number of dots remembered for
each page.

11
Majerus and his colleagues (2006) distinguish between two types of information within the
phonological loop: (1) item information, that is, the stored lexical items presented for recall; and (2)
serial order information, which refers to the sequential order in which the items are presented. Thus, in
the task used in this study, participants do not need to memorize the names of the animals per se, but
rather need only to remember the order in which the animals were presented in the list they have
previously heard.

monosyllabic words (e.g., peau `skin', fil `thread', date `date', peur `fear', ski `ski', noix
`walnut') without knowing how many words the list contains; he/she is then
instructed to recall the last two, three, or four words listed by the experimenter.
(g) Comprehension of complex sentences (ECOSSE; Lecocq, 1996, a French
adaptation of the well-known TROG; Bishop, 1989). In this standardized
task, which was reduced by half and only included complex utterances, the
examiner reads a sentence referring to one of four drawings, and the
participant's task is to point to the one that corresponds to the meaning of
the sentence. The distracter drawings differ from the target sentence by either
a lexical or grammatical element. The sentences are divided into blocks
composed of gradual syntactic complexity (e.g., La vache que le chien
poursuit est marron; le cercle dans lequel il y a une etoile est rouge `the cow
that the dog is chasing is brown; the circle in which there is a star is red').
(h) Repetition of complex sentences (Delage & Frauenfelder, 2012). The child has to
repeat sentences that include embedded clauses whose syntactic complexity
varies. Two factors of syntactic complexity are manipulated: the type of
relative clause (with one or two movements resulting in different word
orders) and the depth of embedding (cf. Table 4).12 The task consists of 8
control sentences (without embedding) and 16 complex sentences, all
containing relative clauses. Control and complex sentences are of the same
length (14 syllables per sentence). The repeated sentence is considered correct
if the target structure is uttered (e.g., subject relative clause: qui pleure `who is
crying') with the expected embedding (here, three levels: Il pense [qu'elle dit
12

As pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, object relatives (OSV) differ from other relatives not only
by word order but also by the fact that they have pronominal subjects. If we consider, in the line of
Culbertson (2010), that in spoken French subjects clitics are agreement markers rather than an
argument equivalent to full DP subjects, we are faced with an additional difference whose influence
cannot be explored specifically in this work.

[que le garcon deteste la fille [qui pleure]]] `He thinks [that she is saying [that the

because it allows us to evaluate precisely the ability of children to produce
structures in which complexity is manipulated, which is not the case for
spontaneous language analysis or classical elicitation tasks.13

(i) Syntactic analysis of spontaneous language samples. Spontaneous language
samples are elicited during free interview contexts where 60 utterances per
child14 are analyzed. After the initial coding, all transcriptions were checked
by an expert linguist who also listened to all of the corresponding audio
files.15 Our measures are (i) `MLU' (total number of words / total number of
sentences); (ii) rate (= proportion) of embedded clauses (number of
subordinate clauses / number of verbal utterances); and (iii) rate of multiple
embedding (number of subordinate clauses embedded in another
subordinate clause / number of verbal utterances). Utterances are parsed
using C-units, each unit corresponding to one main clause with all
Hence, in spontaneous language, children have the `choice' of the structures used. If, for example, they
produce no relative clauses in their corpora, this does not necessarily mean that they are unable to produce
sentences with this degree of complexity. As for elicited production, it is very difficult to elicit relative
clauses with multiple levels of embedding (with levels 2 or 3). Indeed, the existing materials only elicit
subject and object relatives with only one level of embedding (see for example Friedman &
Novogrodsky, 2004).
14
These 60 utterances were systematically selected from the fifth minute of the interview in order to
obtain a sample where the child was more relaxed.
15
Transcript reliability was calculated for 10% of the transcripts with percentage agreement above 90%.

`And then lastly there are the animals who can talk because in their network

Such embedded clauses may be used more or less frequently by children as a function of
individual stylistic choices. To limit this variability and minimalize the diversity of
conversation topics, each interview followed the same format, with specific questions
about leisure activities.
Main results
Preliminary hypothesis: performance improves with age
As expected, our results revealed a strong age effect for syntax and for WM in control
children (CTRL), since age is significantly correlated with almost all measures of syntax
and WM in this group of 48 participants (Table 5). Note that, due to multiple variables
considered, we performed a Bonferroni correction ( p < .0023) in dividing the critical p
value by the number of comparisons being made.
However, this age effect is largely absent in the DLD population despite the fact that
the age range of this population is larger (five to fourteen years) than in the controls
(five to twelve years). More precisely, although 5 out of 6 working memory measures
16
PR = main clause; SUB = subordinate clause; NF = non-finite clause. Numbers indicate the level of
embedding of the subordinate clause.

and all language measures correlate significantly with age in control children, only one
measure correlates with age in children with DLD (counting span). These results may
reflect a dissociation between the normal maturation of syntax and WM in control
children and a slower development observed in children with DLD in the same
domains. Note, however, that the different number of participants in each group (48
for controls, 28 for DLD) makes it difficult to compare the two groups with respect
to these patterns of correlations. Thus, the moderate correlations in the DLD group
(for syntactic comprehension or running span for example) are not significant,
whereas such levels of correlations are significant in controls due to the higher
number of participants. In order to take into account this problem, we have
conducted the same analyses with a subgroup of 28 control children, age-matched
with DLD children (M = 8;11). Results are presented on Table 5 (in the darker tint)
and display the same pattern of correlations except for two correlations that become
non-significant (rate of multiple embedding and running span).
Preliminary hypothesis: controls versus DLD
With regard to syntax, Table 6 sheds light on the severe difficulties encountered by
children with DLD in this domain since they significantly differ from the control
children for all the measures. We conducted other analyses which demonstrate that
the difficulties encountered by these children are particularly specific to complex
syntax. For instance, in spontaneous language, children with DLD produce
significantly less complex sentences (i.e. utterances containing at least one embedded
clause) than controls (14% versus 24%; t(74) = 5.4, p < .001, d = 1.2). At the same
time, they produce as many simple sentences (without embedded clauses) as controls
(60% versus 62%), revealing that children with DLD seem to avoid producing
complex sentences when they can make sentences choosing their own words. The
fact that children with DLD also produce more non-verbal utterances than controls
(25% versus 10%; t(74) = -5.5, p < .001, d = 1.2) further supports this claim.
As expected, the performance of controls and that of children with DLD also differs
statistically in all WM measures, with weaker scores in DLD, as shown in Table 7.
Figures 1-2 show these results, with the distribution of performance in both groups,
for the counting span task and the non-word repetition task.
Moreover, the performance of children with DLD on some simple-span tasks
remains below that of younger control children, as illustrated in Figures 3-4, which
show differences between young control children aged eight to nine (M age = 8;11,
N = 16) and the `oldest' DLD group aged nine to fourteen (M age = 10;5, N = 14) for
the tasks of non-word repetition and word span (respectively: t(28) = 5.3., p < .001,
d = 1.9; t(28) = 4.8, p < .001, d = 1.8).

Main hypothesis: predictive link between working memory and complex syntax
We proceeded to multiple linear regression analyses in order to test for a predictive
relationship between WM and syntax. To simplify these analyses we calculated
unit-weighted standardized composite scores for simple and complex spans.17 Since

We carried out the tests in this manner because all three simple-span tasks were highly correlated
(r = .56, p < .001); similar results were found for the three complex-span tasks (r = .48, p < .001).

correlation matrices (see `Appendices 1 and 2') point to a possible high degree of
collinearity between our four predictors (age, non-verbal reasoning, simple spans,
and complex spans), we calculated an index of collinearity of 19.6. This result
showed a medium collinearity, as defined by condition numbers of more than 15
(Besley, Kuh, & Welsch, 1980). To deal with this collinearity in our data, we
orthogonalized all our predictors to obtain variables which were no longer
interdependent (Baayen, 2008). This enabled us to analyze each factor independently.
Moreover, as previously described, simple- and complex-span tasks respectively assess the same theoretical
constructs, namely the phonological loop for verbal simple spans, and the additional intervention of the
central executive for verbal complex spans. These composite scores were calculated for each group
(controls and DLD) separately. We proceeded in the same manner for the orthogonalization of potential
predictors.

Indeed, one part of the variance of scores in WM can be attributable to age (the older
the children, the better their results). In this case, orthogonalization can remove part of
the age-related variance on other predictors and can consequently reduce the
interdependency between variables. The possible predictors considered were the
composite scores of simple and complex spans, as well as age and non-verbal
reasoning. Predicted variables were the different (continuous) measures of complex
syntax. The entire set of orthogonalized predictors was entered at a single step. We
ran multiple linear regression analyses on each of our five measures of syntactic
complexity using the `lme4' (Bates et al., 2011) and `languageR' (Baayen, 2010)
packages for R.2.11.1 software.
Tables 8 to 12 present the detailed results for these regression analyses conducted in
controls and in children with DLD for each measure of complex syntax. For both
groups, the combination of simple spans, complex spans, and age explained a
significant part of the variance in the comprehension of complex sentences (55% for
controls and 50% for DLD). These predictors are also of particular importance in
the repetition of complex sentences, with 51% of the variance explained in control
children and 58% in children with DLD. In contrast, results in both groups slightly
differ when considering spontaneous language measures (Tables 10, 11, and 12). In
fact, our findings revealed that complex-span tasks strongly predicted all three
measures of spontaneous language in the control group, whereas this predictor does

possible predictors: the six WM scores and age. Again, the results revealed different
tendencies depending on the group. In control children, the counting span
(= complex-span task) is the only WM task which, associated with age, significantly
predicts the three syntactic measures: 25% of the variance of MLU (F(7,40) = 3.2,
p < .01),18 19% of the variance of the rate of embedded clauses (F(7,40) = 2.6,
p < .05),19 and 11% of the variance of the rate of multiple embedding (F(7,40) = 1.9,
p < .05).20 In children with DLD, however, the word span (= simple-span task)
explains 35% of the variance of MLU (F(7,20) = 3.1, p < .05)21 and 22% of the
variance of the rate of embedded clauses (F(7,20) = 3.6, p < .05).22

General discussion
First, our results confirm that WM and complex syntax capacities increase considerably
with age in control children, whereas this progression seems to be slower in children
with DLD. Note, however, that these differences in changes in performance over
time have to be interpreted with extreme caution since only a longitudinal study,
following the same children from a young age to adolescence, could confirm that,
with age, the maturation timeline of WM capacities differs between the two groups.
Our results also show persistent limitations in both syntax and WM in DLD, who
obtained lower scores than controls, which has already been described in adolescents

with DLD (Tuller et al., 2012, for complex syntax, and Weismer, Plante, Jones, &
Tomblin, 2005, for WM).
Second, we have demonstrated a close relationship between WM capacities and
complex syntax, with simple and complex span explaining a significant part of the
variance in the syntactic measures. These findings support Jakubowicz's (2011)
hypothesis suggesting that (1) the progressive maturation of WM in typically
developing children explains, at least in part, the increase of the mastery of complex
syntax with age; and (2) the WM deficits observed in children with DLD limit their
ability to process complex syntax. Nevertheless, one could venture an objection: since
it is known that WM is strongly related to general IQ level (see for example Colom,
Abad, Quiroga, Shih, & Flores-Mendoza, 2008), it is perhaps general IQ level that
predicts syntax development rather than WM itself. However, as already mentioned,
our results cannot be explained in this way since predictors entered in regression
analyses were orthogonalized in order to neutralize their reciprocal influences (and
especially the influence of non-verbal reasoning on WM performance). Moreover,
non-verbal reasoning capacities, entered as potential predictors, almost never
appeared as a significant predictor for complex syntax performance. Since age alone
cannot explain the strong predictive relationship observed between WM and syntax,
these results thus argue for a specific relationship between WM and syntax.
Another observation supports this particular relationship between WM and complex
syntax (and not grammar in general). In our analysis of the spontaneous language
samples, we computed the proportion of complex and simple sentences. Whereas
WM measures correlated with the complex syntax measures, neither simple nor
complex spans did so with the proportions of simple verbal or non-verbal utterances.
As a consequence, it seems that complex syntax depends specifically on the WM
capacities of children, as has been demonstrated by previous studies (e.g., Frizelle &
Fletcher, 2015). Similarly, further analyses of the results from the repetition of
complex sentences task show that complex spans predict children's performance on
deep embedded clauses (with at least two degrees of embedding) rather than on
simpler embedded clauses (with only one degree of embedding). Furthermore,
subject relatives, which are simpler constructions than object relatives (since they do
not involve the disruption of the canonical structure), are not predicted by WM
results, in contrast to the more complex object relatives.
Table 13 offers a synthesis of our main results in comparing the common and
specific patterns for controls and DLD children. The results showing a role of WM
in syntactic performance of both populations can be understood straightforwardly for
sentence comprehension and repetition since these tasks logically require the storage
of the verbal material in order to respectively (1) give the right answer for
comprehension or (2) recall the sentence for repetition. As for our measures of
spontaneous language, the results may be surprising since it is, a priori, less obvious
that producing language in a natural context requires an abundance of
computational resources in terms of memory processing, particularly for children
with typical language development. Yet, even in a natural context of conversation,
people have to plan their utterances by remembering the topic of the conversation,
taking into account the feedback of their conversation partner, preparing a response
in advance, and articulating their response at the appropriate moment (Corps,
Gambi, & Pickering, 2018). It is, therefore, not surprising that such cognitive process
tax participants' WMs. In this case, the additional processing required by complex
syntax could produce an overload in sentence production, which is consistent with

the effects of complex spans observed in control children. The fact that only simple
spans predict complex syntax (in spontaneous production) in children with DLD
could then be explained by the fact that language production for these children is
more difficult than comprehension and repetition tasks where their other (lexical and
discursive) difficulties intervene less. In spontaneous production, all their language
difficulties influence language processing, which could explain why even simple
resource processing, such as the ability to maintain verbal material, impacts their
spontaneous language production.
Although controls and DLD results follow the same pattern overall, with simple and
complex spans explaining a large part of variance of their scores in the comprehension
and repetition of complex sentences, we have identified some differences between the
two groups regarding which WM tests best predict syntactic performance in
spontaneous language. Indeed, complex spans, and in particular the counting span
task, explain a significant part of the variance in these measures in control children,
whereas simple spans, and more specifically the serial order reconstruction task, do
so in children with DLD. This is of particular interest since language aspects are
minimized in these specific WM tasks. In fact, in the counting span task, children
need to exclusively manipulate numbers from one to nine (all numbers being
monosyllabic in French) and, in the serial memory task, children only have to
remember the order of animals participating in the race and not their actual names.
Consequently, these tasks rely less on language representations as compared to other
WM tasks, such as the listening span task in which the child needs to retain the last
word of a previously heard sentence and to give a semantic judgement on the same
sentence. The fact that the two tasks that depend least on language best predict
performance in complex syntax supports the conclusion that WM specifically
predicts complex syntax and that this link cannot be explained by inter-individual
differences in language.
Why are certain aspects of complex syntax predicted by different WM tasks in
controls and children with DLD? Indeed, the fact that only simple and not complex
spans predict syntactic complexity measures in spontaneous language samples of
children with DLD raises some questions, since previous results (such as those of
Frizelle & Fletcher, 2015) pointed to specific links between complex spans and
complex syntax. One explanation for this discrepancy refers to the nature of the

624

Delage and Frauenfelder

serial order reconstruction task, a task that was not used by Frizelle and Fletcher. In this
task, only the serial order of words has to be maintained and recalled, a condition that
echoes word order in sentence processing, a component that we know is particularly
difficult for children with DLD, especially when sentences do not follow the
canonical word order of their language (see a.o. Montgomery, Gillam, Evans, &
Sergeev, 2017). Another explanation can be given on the basis of our data. Due to
their well-known difficulties in sustained attention (see Ebert & Kohnert, 2011, for a
meta-analysis), children with DLD lack the necessary processing resources to
complete complex span tasks efficiently, in particular the counting span task, which
has been shown to be linked to sustained attention (Magimairaj & Montgomery,
2013). In other words, the dual-processing involved in these tasks (which require
storage and simultaneous processing) may lead to a floor effect which reduces
inter-individual variability and makes it difficult to find a relation with complex
syntax.23 Figure 1, which illustrated descriptive data for the counting span task,
seems to support this hypothesis. Indeed, DLD performance is not only lower than
that of controls, but is also more homogenous. This graph contrasts with the one
describing the non-word repetition task (Figure 2), a simple-span task, for which the
performance of the two groups is more similarly distributed.
Several studies support the idea that attentional difficulties in children with DLD,
particularly in selective attention processing, influence their WM performance.
Majerus et al. (2009) demonstrated that attentional processing explained more than
30% of the variance in verbal WM capacities, and that it acts as an essential
intermediary between short-term memory and linguistics processing. Our study
focused specifically on WM. However, as underlined by a large number of studies
(see Henry, Messer, & Nash, 2012), attentional deficits are recognized in DLD, 20-
40% of children with language impairments having co-occurring attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (Cardy, Tannock, Johnson, & Johnson, 2010). In fact,
attentional difficulties were observed in 8 participants, 28% of the sample, in the
present study (see Table 2). However, we did not collect any data on attention skills,
and thus we cannot distinguish between the role of working memory and of
attention. Since attention is likely a part of working memory (see Cowan, 2005, or
Oberauer, 2013), future research should examine the role of attention in the syntactic
performance of children with DLD as well.
Returning to the word span task, which tests short-term memory for serial order, we
should mention that previous results showed that atypical populations, including
children with dyscalculia and dyslexia, present difficulties in serial order
reconstruction tasks (Attout & Majerus, 2015; Martinez-Perez, Majerus, Mahot, &
Poncelet, 2012). Our study also reveals that children with DLD encountered
difficulties in this task; more specifically, this task predicts a significant part of MLU
and rate of embedding variance. Since during a serial order memory task children
have to remember/store items they have previously heard, they need to plan the
order of linguistic elements in advance when producing complex sentences. It thus
23
Note that although Frizelle and Fletcher did not evoke such a floor effect for the performance of their
children with DLD, the simple analysis of the standard deviations obtained by their participants pointed in
this direction. Indeed, scores of children with DLD (aged six to seven) and of age-matched TD (aged four)
displayed similar variability for scores in simple-span tasks (in digit, word, and non-word recalls) but less
variability on complex-span tasks for participants with DLD, especially for counting span and backward
digit span.

seems that similar mechanisms underlie serial order memory tasks and the production
of complex sentences since in both cases the linearization of verbal elements is involved.
Thus, the fact that in this study children with DLD score lower in serial memory tasks
could explain why this population, in particular, avoids producing complex sentences in
their spontaneous language.
In sum, the results of this study show a strong predictive relationship between WM
and complex syntax.24 Even though our results should be treated with caution due to
the relatively small sample of participants with DLD, they are supported by other
studies that used larger cohorts (117 children with DLD in Montgomery et al.,
2018). We thus think that our results have clear clinical implications. Indeed, if WM
limitations in children with DLD truly predict complex syntax deficits in this
population, it would then be appropriate to train the WM of this population. Further
studies should therefore investigate the impact of a motivated and specific WM
rehabilitation programme on syntactic performance in children with DLD, a
particular need which had already been formulated by Montgomery (2002):
"Structuring intervention with students with DLD to include training of cognitive
processes would seem to be important [...] we propose that this process should
consider other reliable sources of emerging evidence, particularly from psychology, to
support the use of alternative treatment approaches such as memory training with
students with DLD" (Montgomery et al., 2010, p. 88). Surprisingly, while intensive
WM training programmes inundate the market (with programmes such as Cogmed:
Klingberg et al., 2005; or Jungle Memory: Alloway, Bibile, & Lau, 2013), to the best
of our knowledge no scientific study analyzing the effect of such training on the
language of children with DLD that respects the methodological principles (such as
the use of control groups) has been published. Even if prior studies, which were
often conducted with typically developing participants, revealed relatively little
transfer of skills (Melby-Lervag & Hulme, 2013), other studies including children
with intellectual disabilities (see Danielsson, Zottarel, Palmqvist, & Lanfranchi, 2015,
for a meta-analytic review) or adults with aphasia (Eom & Sung, 2016; Zakarias,
Keresztes, Marton, & Wartenburger, 2016) are clearly more promising. Finally, we
believe that the results of our study could influence the conceptualization of new
WM training programmes. These would differ from existing programmes which
include a large proportion of visual WM tasks, such as Cogmed, by including
training activities targeting specific verbal WM. More precisely, training activities
would focus on the working memory aspects that have been shown to be predictive
of syntactic performance, such as serial order WM in DLD. Such tailor-made WM
intervention programmes could be more effective but still require further empirical
support (Majerus, 2016). Specifically on this topic, we recently conducted such a
WM training study which shows improvement of complex syntax in children with
DLD, more precisely on accusative pronoun production, a clinical marker of DLD in
French (Stanford, Durrleman, & Delage, in press).

As pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, we included only children with severe language disorders
(due to the criterion used in French-speaking countries). Results may have been different if we had included
children with less severe deficits, using Anglo-Saxon criteria.
