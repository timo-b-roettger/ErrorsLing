This study examines language control deficits in bilingual aphasia in terms of domain specific cognitive control and domain
general cognitive control. Thirty Spanish-English controls and ten Spanish-English adults with aphasia completed the
flanker task and a word-pair relatedness judgment task. All participants exhibited congruency effects on the flanker task. On
the linguistic task, controls did not show the congruency effect on the first level analysis. However, conflict ratios revealed that
the control group exhibited significant effects of language control. Additionally, individual patient analysis revealed overall
positive and negative effects of language control impairment and a benefit from semantically related word-pairs. Patient data
suggest a dissociation between the mechanisms of language control and cognitive control, thus providing evidence for domain
specific cognitive control. The influence of language proficiency on speed of translation was also examined. Generally,
controls were faster when translating into their dominant language, whereas the patients did not show the same trends.

Introduction
Bilingualism is a dynamic operation of language
processing influenced by various factors (e.g., language
proficiency, exposure to each language over the lifetime,
and environmental contexts). Recently, a burgeoning body
of research that investigates how one mind processes two
or more languages has emerged. Experimental paradigms
range from behavioral designs (Costa & Santesteban,
2004; Hermans, Bongaerts, De Bot & Schreuder, 1998;
Zied, Phillipe, Pinon, Havet-Thomassin, Aubin & Roy,
2004) to studies that use imaging techniques (Chee, Hon,
Lee, & Soon, 2001; Hernandez, Dapretto, Mazziotta
& Bookheimer, 2001; for a review, see Abutalebi &
Green, 2008). Current work in bilingualism research is
slowly expanding to include individuals with aphasia
(Abutalebi, Miozzo & Cappa, 2000; Gray & Kiran, 2013;
Green, Grogan, Crinion, Ali, Sutton & Price, 2010; Kiran,
Sandberg, Gray, Ascenso & Kester, 2013).
It is well documented that in the bilingual brain both
languages are active when processing a task that requires
one language (Colome, 2001; Costa & Caramazza,
1999; Costa & Santesteban 2004; Hermans et al., 1998;
Kaushanskaya & Marian, 2007; Kroll & Stewart, 1994;
Meuter & Allport, 1999; Tzelgov, Henik & Leiser, 1990;
Zied et al., 2004). In order to successfully manage their
languages, bilingual individuals must exert some control
over the non-target language, but how this is accomplished


We would like to thank all participants for their time and effort

Research Laboratory for their intellectual input.

is still under debate (Costa & Santesteban, 2004; Costa,
Santesteban & Ivanova, 2006; Dijkstra & Van Heuven,
2002; Green, 1998; Hermans et al., 1998). For a review
of this topic, see Costa (2005), Kroll, Bobb, Misra and
Guo (2008) and Kroll, Bobb and Wodniecka (2006).
Relevant to this study is that bilingualism imposes a
demand to switch between languages; however, it still
must be determined if this mechanism to switch languages
is specific to the language domain or cognitive domain.
Various researchers claim that because bilinguals are
constantly monitoring two languages, there is a benefit
that transfers to executive functioning skills. Extensive
work by Bialystok and colleagues (Bialystok, 2010;
Bialystok, 2011; Bialystok, Craik, Klein & Viswanathan,
2004; Bialystok, Craik & Luk, 2008; for review see
Bialystok, Craik, Green & Gollan, 2009) suggests that
being bilingual offers cognitive advantages such as better
performance on the Stroop task, Simon task, and global
local tasks (a paradigm that measures the inhibition of
visual attention to the overall composition of a stimulus
versus the specific details). In addition to having this
ability to manage two or more active languages, there
are other non-linguistic cognitive advantages. Studies that
examine attentional networks and conflict monitoring
skills tasks also suggest that bilinguals enjoy an added
benefit to cognitive control processing that offers higher,
more efficient performance on nonverbal tasks compared
to monolinguals (Costa, Hernandez & Sebastian-Galles,
2008; Costa, Hernandez, Costa-Faidella & SebastianGalles, 2009). For instance, Costa et al. (2008) and Costa
et al. (2009) asked bilingual and monolingual individuals

to perform tasks that required non-linguistic conflict and
attention monitoring tasks. Results revealed that people
who were bilingual (i.e., those who constantly monitor
two languages) were more efficient on non-linguistic
tasks compared to their monolingual counterparts. These
studies show that by constantly managing multiple
languages, this skill of control carries over to nonlinguistic cognitive processing.
This association between the two types of control
is indicative of domain general cognitive control. This
type of processing suggests that mechanisms of language
control and mechanisms of cognitive control are not
completely independent. It should be noted that this body
of literature is based on the evidence that bilinguals
have better cognitive control relative to their monolingual
counterparts, but how this affects the degree of domain
general versus domain specific mechanisms is not clear.
An opposing view is that language control may
function independently of cognitive control and this view
is termed domain specific control (Calabria, Branzi,
Marne, Hernandez & Costa, 2013; Calabria, Hernandez,
Branzi & Costa, 2011; Magezi, Khateb, Mouthon, Spierer
& Annoni, 2012; Weissberger, Wierenga, Bondi & Gollan,
2012). Calabria et al. (2011) asked highly proficient
bilingual participants to perform a non-linguistic card
sorting (color/shape) task and a cued naming task
using their first language (L1) (Catalan) and second
language (L2) (Spanish) and then using their L1 and
third language (L3) (low proficient English). Response
times from switch and non-switch trials on the nonlinguistic and linguistic experiments were analyzed and
compared. Results showed symmetrical switch costs for
the language task but asymmetrical switch costs for
the non-linguistic task, revealing a dissociation between
the bilingual language control network and general
cognitive control system. More recently, Calabria et al.
(2013) evaluated the mechanisms of bilingual language
control and non-linguistic control by comparing three
age groups of bilinguals on a language switching task
and a non-linguistic switching task. Findings revealed
age related change only on the non-linguistic task,
indicating a dissociation between the two control systems.
In another study, Magezi et al. (2012) investigated a group
of heterogeneous bilinguals' performance on a picture
naming task and an alphanumeric categorization task
in single and mixed contexts. Behavioral data analysis
revealed a greater mixing cost in the alphanumeric
task compared to the linguistic task, suggesting that
language control is partly independent from general
cognitive control. Weissberger et al. (2012) compared
older bilinguals to their younger counterparts while
completing a color-shape identification switching task and
cued language switching task (number naming). Results
of both tasks revealed effects of aging, but specific
effects differed across tasks. The color-shape task revealed

more age related costs (e.g., more errors and longer
response times), compared to the language task. Notably,
all participants were able to complete the linguistic task
yet a handful of the older participants were not able
to perform the non-linguistic task. These results also
suggest a dissociation between mechanisms of language
control and general cognitive control, indicative of domain
specific control mechanisms.
As discussed, empirical data provides conflicting
evidence where some studies reveal a dissociation
between mechanisms of language control and cognitive
control indicative of domain specific cognitive control,
whereas other studies show an association between
these control mechanisms, indicative of domain general
cognitive control. In contrast to healthy bilinguals,
bilingual adults with aphasia are vulnerable to language
control deficits (e.g., the inability to suppress the nontarget language) because (a) bilingual individuals must
manage (i.e., control) two languages and (b) the nature of
aphasia is that it concerns language impairment. It is not
known whether aphasia overrides control mechanisms in
a specific (i.e., dissociated) way, or in a domain-general
manner, but this knowledge is critical to effectively
diagnosing and treating this population. For example,
if the overlap is extensive and a patient presents with
pathological language switching, theoretically, treatment
could be targeted at training cognitive control rather than
language control.
Case studies investigating language control impairment in bilingual adults with aphasia have explored
asymmetric translation deficits and pathological language
switching/mixing qualitatively and associate these types
of deficits with subcortical damage (Abutalebi et al., 2000;
Ansaldo & Marcotte, 2007; Ansaldo, Saidi & Ruiz, 2010;
Adrover-Roig, Galparsoro-Izagirre, Marcotte, Ferre,
Wilson & Ansaldo, 2011; Garcia-Caballero, Garcia-Lado,
Gonzalez-Hermida, Area, Recimil, Rabadan, Lamas,
Ozaita & Jorge, 2007; Keane & Kiran, under revision).
For instance, Ansaldo and Marcotte (2007) and Ansaldo
et al. (2010) reported the case of a Spanish-English
bilingual patient who suffered a left subcortical lesion
and presented with pathological language mixing and
switching. In another example, Abutalebi et al. (2000)
reported the case of a balanced pre-stroke polyglot
who presented with language mixing resulting from
a subcortical infarct. Rather extensively, these studies
highlight the influence that subcortical lesions may
have on language control deficits. Furthermore, they
suggest a link between language control deficits and
cognitive control deficits which needs to be explored and
defined.
The abovementioned case studies that examine
language control in bilingual aphasia are somewhat
limiting because they are case studies that omit
investigations of control within non-linguistic contexts.

Cognitive control in bilingual aphasia
However, a few studies do include experimental
paradigms that evaluate control in the linguistic and nonlinguistic domains. For instance, Green et al. (2010) used
three conflict tasks (lexical decision, the Stroop task
in L1 and English, and the flanker task) to investigate
interference effects (i.e., the effect of non-target stimuli
on target stimuli which can result in slow response times)
in healthy bilingual and monolingual adults and two
bilingual adults with aphasia. One aim of the study was
to explore the hypothesis that bilingual patients who
are equally impaired in both languages (i.e., parallel
impairment) can exhibit breakdowns in control within
non-linguistic contexts. Imaging data revealed that Patient
1 presented with a subcortical lesion that included the left
lentiform nucleus, and Patient 2's lesion encompassed the
left middle cerebral artery and affected the left frontal
and temporal areas, as well as the bilateral occipital
region. Bilingual patient performance on the linguistic
and non-linguistic tasks revealed a double dissociation
of impairment on control processing. Specifically, Patient
1's results revealed abnormal Stroop performance paired
with less abnormal flanker performance, whereas Patient
2 demonstrated the opposite pattern where results revealed
abnormal flanker performance paired with less abnormal
Stroop performance. These findings provoke interesting
implications for the hypothesis of domain specific versus
domain general cognitive processing because the patients
presented with opposing impairment trends on the
linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. Another interesting
observation is that these two patients were both diagnosed
with parallel language impairment which does not
generally point to language control impairment but rather
language loss; however, these data suggest that parallel
language impairment may be indicative of language
control deficits.
In another study, Verreyt, De Letter, Hemelsoet,
Santens and Duyck (2013) explored the possible effects
of language control on differential language impairment
in one bilingual adult with aphasia whose French (L1)
was less impaired than Dutch (L2). Testing consisted of
the flanker task and a lexical decision task that included
three versions, all containing cognate and non-cognate
word types: a generalized version (stimuli and targets in
French and Dutch) and two selective versions (stimuli
in French and Dutch but targets in either French or
Dutch). Participants were instructed to identify stimuli
as a word or a non-word. In theory, the generalized
version requires less language control relative to the
selective version. Results revealed that on the generalized
version, cognate facilitation was observed, suggesting that
cognates were receiving activation from both languages.
On the French selective version, no effect of cognate
facilitation was observed, suggesting no interference from
Dutch. In contrast, on the Dutch version, cognates were
identified with less accuracy relative to their non-cognate

435

Dutch counterparts, suggesting that the less impaired
French was exerting some degree of interference that
could not be suppressed. In sum, the linguistic results
are indicative of language control impairment where
the stronger language (French) could not be inhibited.
Combined with the results on the flanker task (that
were indicative of impaired non-linguistic control), the
outcome points to an overlap between language control
and cognitive control processing.
More recently, Dash and Kar (2014) investigated
the relationship between language control and cognitive
control in four bilingual patients with aphasia.
Experimental tasks included a linguistic and nonlinguistic flanker task and a non-linguistic negative
priming task. The variation in performance across tasks
was identified by examining two modes of control: 1)
proactive control which is anticipatory towards upcoming,
future events, and 2) reactive control which is concerned
with transient information and requires the ability to
resolve interference after it occurs. Results across tasks
revealed that some patients relied more on proactive
control to complete the linguistic task while relying
more on reactive control to complete the non-linguistic
task, whereas other patients showed the opposite pattern.
These results are compelling because they are at odds
with previous studies (e.g., Green et al., 2010; Verreyt
et al., 2013) and suggest that at some level of processing,
language control mechanisms are independent from
cognitive control mechanisms.
The Green et al. (2010), Verreyt et al. (2013) and Dash
and Kar (2014) studies are all case studies that employ the
flanker task for a measure of non-linguistic control. However, the linguistic control tasks differ: where Green et al.
(2010) employed the Stroop task, Verreyt et al. (2013)
designed a lexical decision task that was strategically
designed to tap language control, and Dash and Kar (2014)
used a linguistic flanker task. Although the present study
uses the flanker to tap non-linguistic control, consistent
with other studies that measure non-linguistic inhibitory
control in patient and non-patient populations (e.g., Costa
et al., 2009; Green et al., 2010; Green, Ruffle, Grogan,
Ali, Ramsden, Schofield, Leff, Crinon & Price, 2011; Luk,
Anderson, Craik, Bialystok & Grady, 2010), our study is
different from the three aforementioned studies because
1) it is a multi-case study which allows us to perform
group analyses, and 2) it includes a unique linguistic task
specifically designed to tap effects of language control.
An important similarity between Dash and Kar (2014) and
the present study is that both studies explore the effects
of language proficiency on performance. Although very
little is understood about bilingual aphasia and language
control processing, we do know that proficiency does
influence post-stroke language skill in bilingual adults
with aphasia. In 2013, Gray and Kiran investigated the
effect of pre-morbid language-use related factors (i.e.,

436

Teresa Gray and Swathi Kiran

confidence to speak L1 and L2, self-rating report for
L1 and L2, and post-stroke current exposure for L1
and L2), on post-stroke language performance. Results
revealed that pre-stroke language proficiency in L1 and
L2 can determine the presentation of post-stroke language
performance. These results indicate the importance of
accounting for language proficiency when examining
language processing or control deficits in bilingual
aphasia; therefore, we examine it in the present study.
The preliminary evidence thus far suggests that
individuals with bilingual aphasia may have language
control deficits and some of these individuals exhibit an
extension to deficits in non-linguistic cognitive control.
However, the mechanisms of language control impairment
and cognitive control impairment in bilingual aphasia
are not clearly understood. Therefore, we systematically
investigate whether differences arise between a linguistic
task and non-linguistic task (as measured by congruency
effects) when neurologically healthy bilingual adults
(hereafter NHBA) and bilingual adults with aphasia
(hereafter BAA) complete the flanker task (Eriksen &
Eriksen, 1974) that examines non-linguistic inhibitory
control and a word-pair relatedness judgment task that
examines linguistic inhibitory control. As mentioned
before, our choice of the flanker task is consistent with
other recent studies. For the linguistic task geared to
tap language control, it was imperative that we employ
a receptive language task, consistent with previous
studies that have also examined language control in this
population (Dash & Kar, 2014; Verreyt et al., 2013).
Because BAA may experience a range of lexical access
deficits on top of language control deficits, the use of
a receptive language task eliminates the confounding
variable of lexical access impairment which can arise
during an expressive language task.
Another aim of the present study is to evaluate the
effect of language dominance on direction of translation.
The Revised Hierarchical model (RHM; Kroll & Stewart,
1994) accounts for translation asymmetries. In this model,
the dominant language has a direct link between a word
and its meaning (i.e., the concept of a word), and the less
dominant language accesses the meaning via the word in
the stronger language. Thus, unbalanced bilinguals will
exhibit longer response time latencies when translating
from the weaker language into the stronger language
compared to the translating from the stronger language
into the weaker language. However, as proficiency in the
weaker language improves, both languages access word
meanings via direct links which can theoretically affect
response time latencies. Thus, balanced bilinguals will
exhibit same response time latencies when translating
into either language. Therefore, because the linguistic
task in the present study consists of within- and betweenlanguage word-pairs (that translate into Spanish and into
English), we aim to systematically investigate speed of

processing as a function of language proficiency on these
two conditions.
Research questions
Research question 1
Examine the nature of cognitive control in a non-linguistic
task requiring the inhibition of irrelevant information in
a group of Spanish-English NHBA and Spanish-English
BAA. Based on previous research (Prior & Gollan, 2011),
we hypothesize that NHBA will exhibit the congruency
effect (i.e., exhibit faster response times [RTs] when
irrelevant information to be inhibited is congruent relative
to incongruent). However, for BAA, because we know so
little about how this population performs on non-linguistic
control tasks, one hypothesis is that they will exhibit the
congruency effect but an alternative hypothesis is that they
will not exhibit the congruency effect.
Research question 2
Examine the nature of language control and language
processing on a word-pair relatedness judgment task.
Specifically, we asked if NHBA and BAA will exhibit
effects of congruency on a linguistic task that requires
translating between semantically related and semantically
unrelated word-pairs. As previous research indicates,
both languages are simultaneously active in the bilingual
lexicon but the non-target language must be inhibited in
order for the target language to be accessed. Then to switch
languages, the inhibition must be overcome (Green, 1998).
To examine language control and language processing,
we developed a receptive word-pair relatedness judgment
task that includes a prime and a target that vary by two
factors: 1) language type (i.e., within-language [Spanish
or English word-pairs] or between-language [English-
Spanish or Spanish-English word-pairs]), and 2) semantic
relationship (i.e., direct translation [Tr], semantic nontranslation [S], unrelated non-translation [Un], semantic
translation [STr] and unrelated translation [UnTr]). In our
task, trials consisting of within-language word-pairs (S
and Un conditions) are considered `congruent' because
although they still require language control (i.e., inhibition
of the non-target language), they require less language
control effort compared to their between-language wordpair counterparts (STr and UnTr conditions) which are
considered `incongruent'. In order to evaluate language
control, we will compare the S versus STr condition and
Un versus UnTr. We hypothesize that because of the
increased demand of control and because of semantic
relationships that remain constant across contrasts, NHBA
and BAA will exhibit faster RTs when linguistic
information is congruent relevant to incongruent (i.e., S <
STr and Un < UnTr). We also anticipate that because the
Tr condition demonstrates the strongest overlap in lexical
representations compared to the other conditions, it has a

Cognitive control in bilingual aphasia
unique advantage and will evoke RTs that are faster than
the other conditions (Basnight-Brown & Altarriba, 2007;
Zhao & Li, 2013). Our second hypothesis is based on
our expectations that NHBA and BAA will benefit from
semantic relationships. Semantically related items should
evoke faster RTs relative to unrelated items, thus revealing
an effect of semantic facilitation (i.e., S < U and STr <
UnTr) (Basnight-Brown & Altarriba, 2007, Chen & Ng,
1989; Grainger & Frenck-Mestre, 1998). To summarize,
we expect the following profile of fastest to slowest RTs
by condition: Tr < S < Un < STr < UnTr.

Research Question 3
Building on research questions 1 and 2, we examine the
results from the linguistic and non-linguistic tasks to see
if the mechanisms of control are associated (indicative
of domain general cognitive control), or dissociated
(indicative of domain specific cognitive control). We
expect NHBA to exhibit congruency effects on both
the flanker and word-pair relatedness judgment task
because they are neurologically healthy adults and should,
therefore, be able to complete both tasks with high
accuracy and RTs that align with the domain general
view. In order to systematically investigate mechanisms
of domain general and domain specific control, we
must examine BAA data, and it is unclear if BAA will
demonstrate positive or negative effects of control on the
linguistic and non-linguistic tasks (Dash & Kar, 2014;
Green et al., 2010; Verreyt et al., 2013). For results
that suggest DOMAIN GENERAL COGNITIVE CONTROL,
we expect BAA to show the congruency effect on the
flanker task and word-pair relatedness judgment task
or no congruency effect on the flanker task and wordpair relatedness judgment task. For results that suggest
DOMAIN SPECIFIC COGNITIVE CONTROL , we expect BAA
to show either the congruency effect on the flanker task
and no congruency on the word-pair relatedness task or
no congruency effect on the flanker task and congruency
on the word-pair relatedness judgment task.

Research Question 4
Because we expect to have participants with varying
levels of language proficiency, we will examine the
effect of language dominance on language processing.
Specifically, we asked if language dominance affects
speed of processing during translation and non-translation
conditions that vary by semantic relationship. We
hypothesize that the performance of NHBA and BAA
will align with the Revised Hierarchical Model (Kroll
& Stewart, 1994) in that translating into the dominant
language will be faster than translating into the weaker
language.

Methods
Participants
Thirty right handed, Spanish-English NHBA (14 male,
16 females) ranging in age from 24-85 (M = 48 years,
SD = 15) and 10 right handed, Spanish-English BAA (6
male, 4 female) ranging in age from 32-76 (M = 52, SD
= 14) participated in this study. Participants were either
English or Spanish dominant and either simultaneous or
sequential language learners with L1 being English or
Spanish. Education ranged from elementary to college
level. All BAA were at least 12 months post onset from a
left CVA (except one with a gun-shot wound). See Table 1
for BAA demographic profiles.

Questionnaires and Testing
All participants signed a consent form, filled out a
participant or patient history form and a Language Use
Questionnaire (LUQ: Kiran, Pena, Bedore & Sheng,
2010) that asked specific questions pertaining to: (a)
age of L1 and L2 acquisition; (b) amount of LIFETIME
EXPOSURE , averaged across three modalities (hearing,
speaking and reading), captured as a ratio between L1
and L2 that was averaged across three year intervals
and accounted for age; (c) CONFIDENCE, averaged across
three modalities (hearing, speaking and reading), captured
in percentages out of 100 for L1 and L2 that was
averaged across three year intervals and accounted for
age; (d) current exposure that included an hour by hour
account of language(s) spoken and heard by participant
during his/her daily routine (weekday/weekend) (for BAA
this includes a separate rating for pre- and post-stroke
language exposure) and is expressed as a proportion
between L1 and L2; (e) language proficiency of first
degree family members and is expressed as a percentage
for each language averaged across family members; (f)
language of EDUCATION HISTORY, specifically, languages
spoken and preferred by participant and other students in
elementary school, high school, and college environments
and is expressed as a proportion between L1 and L2; and
(g) LANGUAGE ABILITY RATING (LAR) for L1 and L2
including overall ability, speaking in casual conversations,
listening in casual conversations, speaking in formal
situations, listening in formal situations, and reading
and writing using a 5 point scale Likert scale where 1
represents non-fluent skills (e.g., speaking at the single
word level) and 5 represents native or near native-fluency
(for BAA, LAR data was collected for pre-stroke language
skill) and is expressed as a percentage.
For NHBA, the average age of acquisition (AoA) for
English was 14 years (SD = 20) and the average AoA
for Spanish was .9 years (SD = 4); the average family
proficiency in English was 56% (SD = 41%) and for

Spanish it was 44% (SD = 41%); 12 participants were
English dominant, 12 participants were Spanish dominant
and the remaining 6 were balanced. For BAA, the average
AoA for English was 14 years (SD = 15) and the average
AoA for Spanish was 0 years (SD = 0); the average
family proficiency in English was 50% (SD = 39%)
and for Spanish it was 94% (SD = 11%); 4 participants
were English dominant, and 6 participants were Spanish
dominant.
NHBA and BAA were matched on age (t(38) =
-.72, p < .05), as well as the following variables from
the LUQ: lifetime exposure for Spanish and English,
confidence for Spanish and English, LAR for Spanish and

English, current exposure for English, education history
for English, and family proficiency for Spanish. NHBA
and BAA were not matched on the LUQ Spanish variables
current exposure, education history, or family proficiency.
For results of t-test and descriptive statistics for variables
from the LUQ, see Table 2. For LUQ profiles, see Table 3
for NHBA and Table 4 for BAA.
One of our goals was to examine the role of language
dominance on linguistic task data. Since we had numerous
measures from the LUQ, we turned to our previous work
where we found that pre-stroke LAR is a reliable measure
predictive of post-stroke language deficits (Gray & Kiran,
2013; Kiran, Balachandran & Lucas, 2014). Therefore,

we chose this metric as a method to measure levels
of language dominance. In this study, we established
a measure of language dominance (labeled LARdiff)
based on the language ability rating (LAR) measure
from the LUQ. LARdiff is a quantitative metric of
language dominance computed for each participant by
subtracting LAR Spanish from LAR English. A positive
value indicates English dominance and a negative value
indicates Spanish dominance. (See Table 3 for NHBA
LARdiff profiles and Table 4 for BAA LARdiff profiles.)
In addition to the standard intake forms and LUQ
interview, all patients were administered a battery of
tests that included the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT)
(Paradis, 1989) in both Spanish and English, the BAT
Part C Spanish-English (Paradis, 1989), the Boston
Naming Test (BNT) (Kaplan, Goodglass & Weintraub,
2001) in both Spanish and English, the Pyramids and
Palm Trees Test (PPT) - Picture Version (Howard &
Patterson, 1992), and the Symbol Cancellation, Symbol
Trails, and Design Generation subtests from the Cognitive
Linguistic Quick Test (CLQT) (Helms-Estabrooks, 2001).
BAA were a heterogeneous group consisting of balanced
and unbalanced individuals who were Spanish or English
dominant. They exhibited relatively strong semantic
access (e.g., PPT results M = 85, SD = 14), varying
degrees of lexical impairment marked by low naming
scores (e.g., BNT English results: M = 25, SD = 31,
Spanish results: M = 20, SD = 23), and difficulty
switching between languages as determined by the BAT
Word Recognition (English into Spanish: M = 72,
SD = 25; Spanish into English: M = 74, SD = 28)
and Translation subtests (English into Spanish M = 12,
SD = 22; Spanish into English: M = 23, SD = 24).
We specifically did not include a verbal switching or
naming task because patients with aphasia exhibit verbal
production deficits. Based on test scores, our task of
semantic priming that does not require verbal input is
justified. BAA test results are listed in Table 5.
Tasks
1. Non-Linguistic Task
An adaptation of Erikson and Erikson's (1974) flanker task
was administered on a laptop using E-Prime (Psychology
Software Tools, Inc.). All trials consisted of 5 arrows
with a red target arrow in the center. In congruent trials,
all arrows faced the same direction and in incongruent
conditions, the flanking arrows pointed in opposite
directions relative to the target arrow. Approximately half
of the NHBA and BAA were presented with 40 trials of
congruent and 40 trials of incongruent conditions. We
then introduced a neutral condition which reduced the
number of congruent and incongruent conditions, and the
other half of the participants were presented with 20 trials
of each condition. The task included two blocks, each

consisting of pseudo-randomized trials (of congruent,
incongruent and neutral conditions) that were presented
for 3000ms followed by a randomly jittered ISI duration
fixation (2000ms or 4000ms) to control for the expectation
bias. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as
possible and to respond with a button press "3" if target
arrow was pointing left or "4" if target arrow was pointing
right. Accuracy and RTs were recorded.
2. Linguistic Task
The linguistic task was administered on a laptop using
E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.). The task
consisted of word-pairs that varied by language direction
from prime to target (e.g., English-Spanish, Spanish-
English, or non-translation) and 5 conditions of wordpair relationships. Stimuli included 30 different Spanish
primes and 30 different English primes. Each prime
had 5 target conditions. These conditions are: direct
translation (hereafter Tr), semantically related nontranslation (hereafter S), semantically related translation
(hereafter STr), unrelated non-translation (hereafter
Un), and unrelated translation (hereafter UnTr). In
addition to the five experimental conditions, there
were distractor unrelated non-translation (hereafter
DUn) and distractor unrelated translation (hereafter
DUnTr) conditions to create more no responses relative
to yes responses (See Table 6 for a legend of
condition abbreviations and sample stimuli.) Stimuli were
controlled for cognates and word length. Additionally,
we controlled for frequency across primes and target
conditions. The following stimuli types were matched
for frequency: Spanish primes (M = 3.5, SD =
1.81) and English primes (M = 2.9, SD = .91), t(49)
= -1.47, p = .14; S condition Spanish targets (M = 3.19,
SD = 1.86) and English targets (M = 2.41, SD = 1.63),
t(58) = 1.71, p = .09; STr condition Spanish targets (M
= 2.62, SD = 2.08) and English targets (M = 2.93, SD =
1.87), t(58) = -.61, p = .54; Tr condition Spanish targets
(M = 2.48, SD = 1.67) and English targets (M = 2.88,
SD = 1.95), t(58) = -.86, p = .39; Un condition Spanish
targets (M = 2.81, SD = 1.64) and English targets (M

= 2.31, SD = 1.59), t(53) = 1.14, p = .25; and UnTr
condition Spanish targets (M = 2.48, SD = 1.83) and
English targets (M = 2.64, SD = 1.54), t(53) = -.34, p
= .73.
The task consists of 8 blocks of 53 trials each. At the
end of each block, participants were given the opportunity
to rest and were instructed to press the spacebar when
ready to start the subsequent block. Each run consisted
of four blocks containing only English primes and four
blocks containing only Spanish primes. The order of block
presentation was pseudo-randomized to form eight unique
runs. Assignment of runs was counterbalanced across
participants.
Participants were instructed to indicate whether words
were related or unrelated. Responses were made with a
button press "4" for related and "3" for unrelated. Each
trial began with a prime followed by a 100 ms fixation (+),
followed by a target. . The goal of this task was to capture
automatic processing so the prime and target stimulus
presentation was set at 250 ms for NHBA. After some
pilot testing, we increased the duration to 350 ms for
patients because 250ms was observed to be too fast. After
the target disappeared, NHBA and BAA were given a 1500
ms `response' fixation. Accuracy and RT were recorded.
Procedure
All BAA met with a licensed speech-language pathologist
who is English-Spanish bilingual. NHBA met with either
a trained Spanish-English bilingual student clinician or
a licensed, bilingual speech-language pathologist. The
purpose of the study, the procedures, and possible risks
and benefits were explained to each participant. After
consent was obtained, the LUQ was completed. For
BAA, the LUQ interview included a primary caregiver
so the most accurate language history information
was obtained. Then BAA were administered a battery
of standardized language tests, whereas NHBA then
completed the experiment. The linguistic task was always
administered before the non-linguistic task, and practice
runs for the linguistic and non-linguistic tasks were

Cognitive control in bilingual aphasia
administered to ensure comprehension of the tasks.
Notably, the linguistic practice runs consisted of unique
stimuli that did not overlap with experimental stimuli.
NHBA testing was completed in one session. The total
number of BAA sessions varied because standardized
testing was administered at the pace of each BAA. The
language of the session matched the language of testing
for that day and languages were not mixed (e.g., if Spanish
testing was being administered, instructions were given in
Spanish).
Data Analysis
BAA and NHBA data were analyzed separately. To be
included in data analysis, participants had to complete the
linguistic task and non-linguistic task.
Accuracy and RT data from the linguistic and nonlinguistic tasks for BAA and NHBA were analyzed.
Because the two distractor conditions on the linguistic
task were developed to offset "yes" responses, they were
discarded from all analyses. Only accurate responses were
included in RT analyses. To account for the resulting
individual variability, for each participant we transformed
their linguistic raw RTs into z-scores relative to their own
scores for each condition and used zRTs for all linguistic
analyses.
Results
Non-linguistic task
Accuracy
For NHBA and BAA paired-samples t-tests were
performed to evaluate the effect of condition (i.e.,
congruent and incongruent) on accuracy. NHBA and BAA
did not show a significant effect of condition on accuracy,
NHBA: t(29) = 1.26, p = .22, 2 = .05 and BAA: t(9) =
1.35, p = .21, 2 = .17.
Response time
For NHBA and BAA paired-samples t-tests were
conducted to evaluate the effect of condition on RT. Both,
NHBA, t(29) = -3.26, p < .01, 2 = .27,and BAA, t(9) =
-2.37, p = .05, 2 = .34, showed a significant effect of
condition, with RTs faster for the congruent condition
compared to the incongruent condition, indicating a
congruency effect. (See Figure 1 for all non-linguistic task
results).
Linguistic task
Accuracy
For NHBA and BAA one-way ANCOVAS were
performed to evaluate the effect of condition and direction

443

(i.e., target language) on percent accuracy with language
dominance as the covariate.
NHBA showed a significant effect of condition and
English targets, F(4, 144) = 3.73, p < .01, 2 = .09. Post
hoc LSD pairwise comparisons revealed that NHBA were
less accurate on the STr condition compared to Tr (p <
.01), S (p < .05), Un (p < .05), and UnTr (p < .05). Effect
of condition and Spanish targets was also significant, F(4,
144) = 4.69, p = .001, 2 = .11. Post hoc LSD pairwise
comparisons revealed that NHBA were less accurate on
the S condition compared to Tr (p < .001), STr (p = .05),
Un (p = .001), and UnTr (p < .05). Findings show that
between the languages, there was lower accuracy for S
and STr conditions (see Figure 2).
BAA did not show a significant effect for condition
and English targets, F(4, 44) = 1.74, p = .15, 2 = .13, or
condition and Spanish targets, F(4, 44) = 1.56, p = .20,
2 = .12. However, BAA were trending towards higher
accuracy on semantically related conditions relative to
unrelated conditions for English targets (Tr: M = 66,
SD = 19; S: M = 68, SD = 18; and STr: M = 68, SD
= 17; Un: M = 50, SD = 30; UnTr: M = 51, SD = 21)
and Spanish targets (Tr: M = 68, SD = 21; S: M = 69,
SD = 15; and STr: M = 62, SD = 19; Un: M = 50, SD =
24; UnTr: M = 54, SD = 23), indicating possible effects
of semantic facilitation (see Figure 2).
Response time
Next, we performed one-way ANCOVAs to evaluate the
effect of condition and direction (i.e., target language) on
zRTs for NHBA and BAA with language dominance as
the covariate. We examined differences between S and STr
conditions and Un and UnTr conditions.
NHBA showed a significant effect of condition and
English target, F(4, 144) = 25.35, p < .001, 2 = .38. Post
hoc LSD pairwise comparisons revealed that Tr < S (p <
.001), Tr < STr (p < .001), Tr < Un (p < .001) and UnTr
(p < .001); S < Un (p < .001) and S < UnTr (p < .001);
STr < Un (p < .01) and STr < UnTr (p < .01), whereas
there was no difference between S and STr (p = .882) or
Un and UnTr (p = .705). Effect of condition and Spanish
target was significant, F(4, 144) = 19.436, p < .001, 2 =
.31. Post hoc LSD pairwise comparison showed that Tr <
S (p < .001), Tr < STr (p < .001), Tr < Un (p < .001)
and UnTr (p < .001); S < Un (p < .001), S < UnTr (p <
.01); STr < Un (p = .05), whereas there was no difference
between S and STr (p = .10), STr and UnTr (p = .31) or
Un and UnTr (p = .36). To summarize, Tr was the fastest
condition, S and STr were the next fastest followed by Un
and UnTr for English and Spanish targets, indicating a
semantic benefit on condition (i.e., semantically related
word-pairs require less effort to process, thus they
evoke faster RTs relative to unrelated word-pairs). There
were no significant differences between within- and

For accuracy, NHBA results showed M = 98% (SD = 5%) for congruent conditions and M = 97.5% (SD = 4%) for
incongruent conditions, and BAA results showed M = 87% (SD = 17%) for congruent conditions and M = 86% (SD =
18%) for incongruent conditions. For response time, NHBA results showed M = 763 ms (SD = 199 ms) for congruent
conditions and M = 832 ms (SD = 191 ms) for incongruent conditions, and BAA results showed M = 1075 ms (SD = 347)
for congruent conditions and M = 1148% (SD = 335 ms) for incongruent conditions.

between-language semantically related conditions (S and
STr) and unrelated conditions (Un and UnTr) for English
and Spanish targets (see Figure 3).
BAA results were not significant (English targets: F(4,
44) = 1.35, p = .26, 2 = .11; Spanish targets: F(4, 44) =
.782, p = .54, 2 = .06) (see Figure 3). However, trends
suggest that semantically related conditions (English
targets: Tr, M = -.20, SD = .21; S, M = -.11, SD = .29;
STr, M = -.08, SD = .24 and Spanish targets: Tr, M =
.03, SD = .21; S, M = .05, SD = .20; STr, M = -.02,
SD = .25) were faster than unrelated conditions (English
targets: Un, M = .02, SD = .30; UnTr M = .01, SD =
.21 and Spanish targets: Un, M = .22, SD = .44; UnTr, M
= .11, SD = .47), indicating that BAA may benefit from
semantic relationships (see Figure 3).

As a follow up we calculated conflict ratios for
semantic conditions (S and STr) and unrelated conditions
(Un and UnTr) based on Green et al.'s (2010) formula
where conflict is calculated as the difference between
conflict trials and non-conflict trials divided by nonconflict trials. Then we conducted paired-samples t-tests
between the conflict ratios for semantically related (S/STr)
and unrelated (Un/UnTr) conditions for NHBA and BAA.
Greater conflict ratios indicated greater control required
to complete the task. For NHBA, semantically related
conditions (S/STr) were significantly different from the
unrelated conditions (Un/UnTr), t(29) = 1.95, p = .05,
2 = .12, indicating increased conflict for semantically
related conditions relative to unrelated conditions. BAA
did not show a significant difference in conflict for

semantically related (S/STr) and unrelated conditions
(Un/UnTr), t(9) = -.16, p = .87, 2 = .003, indicating
impaired control (see Figure 4).
Since the ANCOVA model for BAA was not
significant, we visually inspected the BAA zRT data to
identify trends for speed across condition and direction of
translation for fastest and slowest zRTs. For each patient,
we averaged accurate zRTs by condition and direction of
translation to identify fastest zRT and slowest zRTs.
First we examined fastest zRTs. In the first subgroup,
when translating into English, two out of ten BAA were
fastest on the Tr condition and when translating into
Spanish, three out of ten BAA were fastest on the Tr
condition (e.g., see Figure 5: BAA03 translating into
English), indicating that only a few BAA followed the
expected zRT trends. Unexpectedly, the largest subgroup,
when translating into English, consisted of five out of
ten BAA who were fastest on the STr condition and
when translating into Spanish, two out of ten BAA were
fastest on the STr condition, suggesting a benefit from
semantic facilitation and translating between languages

(e.g., see Figure 5: BAA06 translating into English). In
the next subgroup, when translating into English, one
out of ten BAA was fastest on the UnTr condition and
when translating into Spanish, three out of ten BAA were
fastest on the UnTr condition (e.g., see Figure 5: BAA05
translating into Spanish). These BAA showed a benefit
from the between-language conditions without the benefit
of semantic facilitation. The last subgroup consists of
BAA patients who were fastest on the within-language
conditions. For the English S condition, only one BAA
was fastest, for the Spanish S condition, two BAA were
fastest, and for the English Un condition, only one BAA
was fastest (e.g., see Figure 5: BAA01 translating into
English). This smallest subgroup reveals that a few of
BAA benefit from within-language conditions, whether
they are semantically related or unrelated.
Next we examined slowest zRTs. In the largest
subgroup, when translating into English, five out of ten
BAA were slowest on either the Un or UnTr condition
and when translating into Spanish, eight out of ten BAA
were slowest on either the Un or UnTr condition (e.g., see

446

Teresa Gray and Swathi Kiran
patients who were slowest on the Tr or STr conditions.
(See Figure 5 for all BAA RT profiles.)
Finally, we examined the effect of language dominance
on translation. We performed Pearson correlations within
each condition for NHBA and BAA, correlating language
dominance with zRTs in the target language. For language
dominance we used LARdiff scores.
For NHBA on S and Un conditions, English language
dominance was negatively correlated with English target
zRTs (S: r = -.42; Un: r = -.54, p < .01) and
Spanish language dominance was positively correlated
with Spanish target zRTs (S: r = .58, p < .01; Un: r =
.37). This indicates that for within-language conditions,
English dominant NHBA responded faster to English
targets relative to Spanish targets and Spanish dominant
NHBA responded faster to Spanish targets relative to
English targets. For STr, English language dominance had
a strong trend towards a negative correlation with English
target zRTs (r = -.35, p = .06) and Spanish language
dominance was positively correlated with Spanish targets
(r = .53, p < .01), indicating that translating into the
dominant language evokes faster response times relative
to translating into the weaker language. For Tr and
UnTr conditions we see inverse results. For the direct
translation, Tr condition, English language dominance
was not significantly correlated with English target zRTs
(r = .10, p = .60), whereas Spanish language dominance
was positively correlated with Spanish target zRTs (r =
.49, p < .01). Conversely, for the UnTr condition English

align with trends observed in the NHBA zRT data, that

Figure 6. Correlations of language dominance and response time by translation direction. Language dominance is

dominant NHBA were faster when translating into English
(r = -.38, p < .05) but for Spanish dominant NHBA we
did not see significant effects when translating into the
dominant language (r = -.13, p = .51). This indicates that
when translating into the dominant language, only Spanish
dominant NHBA showed significant effects in the Tr condition and only English dominant NHBA showed significant effects in the UnTr condition. Overall, these results
suggest that NHBA show strong relationships for withinlanguage word-pairs in their dominant language and for
semantically related, between-language word-pairs when
translating into the dominant language (see Figure 6).
In line with NHBA results, for BAA on the S condition,
English language dominance was negatively correlated
with English target zRTs (r = -.70, p < .05) and
Spanish language dominance was trending towards a
significant correlation with Spanish target zRTs (r = .56,
p = .08), indicating that for the S condition, English
dominant BAA responded faster to English targets relative
to Spanish targets and Spanish dominant BAA responded
faster to Spanish targets relative to English targets.

For the UnTr condition, Spanish language dominance
was correlated with Spanish target zRTs (r = .73,
p < .05), whereas English language dominance was
not significantly correlated with English target zRTs
(p > .05), suggesting that Spanish dominant BAA are
faster when translating into their dominant language.
Overall, these results for within-language conditions
suggest that BAA show a strong relationship with
semantically related, within-language word-pairs that are
in their dominant language and that Spanish dominant
BAA show a strong relationship for unrelated word-pairs
when translating into the dominant language. All other
correlations evaluating language dominance and target
language were not significant (see Figure 6).
Discussion
In this study we examined the nature of cognitive
control in bilingual aphasia and explored the role
of language proficiency on language processing. As
discussed in the introduction, bilinguals manage two

448

Teresa Gray and Swathi Kiran

languages simultaneously, but it is unclear if mechanisms
of language control are indicative of domain specific
cognitive control, or indicative of domain general
cognitive control. To investigate these control mechanisms
and explore effects of language proficiency on language
processing, we asked four research questions. The first
two questions examined the effects of control in linguistic
and non-linguistic contexts. The third question integrated
the results of the first two questions to determine if
mechanisms of language control and cognitive control are
domain general or domain specific. The fourth question
examined the effect of language proficiency on direction
of translation.
In the first research question we examined the nature
of cognitive control in a non-linguistic task. We employed
the flanker task that included congruent and incongruent
conditions. In terms of response times, NHBA and BAA
results revealed positive effects of non-linguistic cognitive
control, indicating that both groups demonstrated that
suppressing incongruent flanking arrows took longer
relative to suppressing congruent flanking arrows. We
did not observe differences in accuracy between the
two conditions for either group. This was not surprising
because high accuracy is expected on the flanker task
(Costa, Hernandez & Sebastian-Galles, 2008; Soveri,
Rodriguez-Fornells & Laine, 2011).
In the second research question we examined the
nature of language control and language processing. We
employed a semantic word-pair judgment task where two
factors were at play: 1) language processing: targets that
were semantically related to their primes should have
greater activation (Collins & Loftus, 1975) which would
result in faster RTs compared to targets that were unrelated
to their primes, and 2) language control: within-language
word-pairs (S and Un) require less active inhibition of the
non-target language and likely should evoke faster RTs
compared their between-language word-pair counterparts
(STr and UnTr). Therefore, we expected semantically
related conditions to evoke faster RTs relative to unrelated
conditions (S < Un and STr < UnTr), and effects of
congruency (S < STr and Un < UnTr).
First we evaluated accuracy. NHBA were more
accurate on the Tr, Un and UnTr conditions compared
to the S, and STr conditions. These results indicate
that semantically related word-pairs from within- and
between-languages were more difficult to identify than
direct translations or unrelated word-pairs. Next we
examined RTs. For NHBA, the Tr condition evoked the
fastest RTs independent of whether participants were
going into their weaker language or stronger language.
S and STr conditions were the next fastest conditions
followed by the slowest conditions, Un and UnTr. In line
with our language processing predictions, these outcomes
reveal an advantage for semantically related items for
both within- and between-language word-pairs relative

to within- and between-language unrelated word-pairs, a
finding that is supported by studies that show that direct
translation primes elicit quicker responses relative to
semantically related primes (Basnight-Brown & Altarriba,
2007; Zhao & Li, 2013). Regarding language control, it
is surprising that we did not see effects of congruency
(S faster than STr and Un faster than UnTr). While one
interpretation of this data is that the lack of congruency
effect on the linguistic task taken together with the
congruency effect observed on the non-linguistic task
indicates domain specific language control processing for
NHBA, we hypothesize that the receptive task was not
strong enough to sufficiently tax the language control
system in the NHBA group, resulting in no differences
between contrasted conditions. However, because we are
examining bilingual adults with aphasia who may present
with impairment in lexical access and language control,
we needed to use a receptive task in order to tease apart the
two types of impairments that can emerge. This apparent
tradeoff is important because the main goal of the study
was to examine language control in bilingual aphasia
and these individuals can only reliably perform receptive
language tasks.
To further evaluate effects of control on the linguistic
task, we analyzed conflict ratios, which reflect the amount
of control required to perform a task. Higher conflict ratios
indicate greater control required. Previous studies have
used conflict ratios to examine conflict required to perform
particular tasks (e.g., the flanker and Stroop) in bilingual
patients and controls (Green et al., 2010). If the semantic
judgment task in the present study only tapped the
semantic system, lower conflict ratios would be observed
for semantic conditions compared to unrelated conditions.
However, NHBA demonstrated greater conflict on the
semantic conditions, findings that indicate the semantic
conditions require more control compared to the unrelated
conditions. Taken together, the accuracy and RT results
suggest increased cost for semantic conditions (S/STr),
indicating greater need for control.
Now we turn to the BAA group results. Although the
BAA group analysis for accuracy and RT on the linguistic
task did not produce significant findings, we visually
inspected the data. Overall, BAA appeared to benefit
from semantically related items. For accuracy and RT,
group results trended towards higher accuracy and faster
RTs on Tr, S, and STr conditions compared to Un and
UnTr conditions. We then performed individual patient
analyses, similar to other studies that explore language
control in bilingual aphasia (Dash & Kar, 2014; Green
et al., 2010; Verreyt et al., 2013). Findings are two-fold.
Some BAA show positive effects language control as
evidenced by being fastest on within language conditions,
but other BAA do not show positive effects of language
control as evidence by being fastest on between-language
conditions. Additionally, some BAA show a benefit from

Cognitive control in bilingual aphasia
semantic relationships as evidenced by faster RTs on
word-pairs that are semantically related, whereas other
BAA do not. Finally, several patients show faster reaction
times for translations, indicating that that translating from
one language to the other is facilitatory. One surprising
finding was that some BAA were fastest on the unrelated
translations, suggesting that these BAA were simply not
processing the word-pairs or that due to weak language
boundaries, they are making decisions based on the second
word.
Based on the individual analysis on BAA RT
linguistic data, some BAA benefit from within-language
conditions and exhibit interference from betweenlanguage conditions while other BAA show the opposite
effect, exhibiting facilitation from between-language
conditions and no benefit from staying within-language.
This result is counterintuitive, but the finding that STr
is facilitative requires further discussion. Although the
STr condition requires moving between two languages,
it could be that 1) the semantic relationship bootstraps
this process to evoke fast RTs in language processing
for BAA and 2) the language of the prime facilitates
lexical access to the language of the target. BAA show a
benefit from the STr condition because the prime triggers
spreading activation of the semantic network, including
cross-language spreading activation (Colume, 2001; De
Bot, 1992), resulting in robust priming effects and fast
RTs. Because BAA exhibit lexical retrieval deficits (i.e.,
a lack of activation for lexical items because the language
system is impaired) the semantic prime boosts lexical
activation levels. In sum, the observed benefit of STr has
to do with semantic relationships being stronger than the
inhibition required to translate between-languages.
It is also worth noting that as a group, BAA did not
show a significant difference in conflict ratios between
semantic conditions (S/STr) and unrelated conditions
(Un/UnTr). Taken together with the semantic facilitation
in the STr condition, BAA results suggest an interesting
pattern of a lack of control required for the semantic
translations. Therefore, it is possible that the semantic
benefit is more important than the boundary of language.
These results are validated by treatment studies that
reveal generalization to the semantic translation of the
target is based on semantic facilitation and bilingual
lexical retrieval (Edmonds & Kiran, 2006; Kiran et al.,
2013; Kiran & Roberts, 2010). Furthermore, patterns
in these data emerge across language dominance, apart
from within- or between-language conditions, and quite
possibly reveal a tradeoff between within- and betweenlanguage processing.
To answer the third question, we examined if the
non-linguistic and linguistic task results were indicative
of domain specific or domain general cognitive control.
We predicted that NHBA would exhibit the congruency
effect on the flanker task and the linguistic task. On the

449

flanker task, NHBA showed the congruency effect. On
the linguistic task, NHBA did not show the congruency
effect on the first level analysis (i.e., S vs STr and Un vs
UnTr). However, in the follow up conflict ratio analysis on
the linguistic task, results revealed that NHBA did exhibit
effects of language control. While we cannot rule out the
possibility that the receptive language task we employed
did not amplify the difference between congruent and
incongruent conditions for NHBA, the results tentatively
provide evidence for domain general cognitive control.
Nevertheless, to identify domain general cognitive
control vs. domain specific cognitive control, we must
focus on BAA performance on these two tasks.
For evidence of mechanisms of DOMAIN GENERAL
COGNITIVE CONTROL , we made two predictions: 1) BAA
would show the congruency effect on the flanker task and
the linguistic task, or alternatively, 2) BAA would not
show the congruency effect on the flanker task and the
linguistic task. For evidence of mechanisms of DOMAIN
SPECIFIC COGNITIVE CONTROL , we made two predictions:
1) BAA would show the congruency effect on the flanker
task and no congruency effect on the linguistic task, or
alternatively, 2) BAA would not show the congruency
effect on the flanker task and show the congruency
effect on the linguistic task. Results revealed that BAA
showed the congruency effect on the flanker task but did
not show the congruency effect on the linguistic task
(as evidenced by group analyses, individual analyses,
and conflict ratios), suggesting a dissociation between
language control and cognitive control, indicative of
domain specific cognitive control. In relation to previous
studies that explore control mechanisms in bilingual
aphasia, our results align with Dash and Kar (2014) that
identified a dissociation between language control and
cognitive control, but are at odds with the Green et al.
(2010) and Verreyt et al. (2013) studies that identified
impaired linguistic and non-linguistic control.
In the fourth research question we examined the
effect of language dominance on language processing.
Specifically, we explored the effect of language
dominance on lexical access in terms of betweenlanguage conditions on direction of translation. Based
on psycholinguistic models of language control including
the Inhibitory Control model (Green, 1998) and the
RHM (Kroll & Stewart, 1994), as well as empirical
data that provide evidence in support of these models
(e.g., Costa & Santesteban, 2004; Meuter & Allport,
1999), we expected participants to demonstrate faster
RTs when translating into their dominant language. The
NHBA results from semantically related word-pairs (STr
and Tr conditions) confirm these findings, suggesting
that to switch into the dominant language, a bilingual
must overcome inhibition required to suppress that
language. In contrast, it was surprising that only for the
within-language S condition did the BAA show faster

450

Teresa Gray and Swathi Kiran

RTs in their dominant language. These results clearly
indicate that BAA are not processing language in the
same way as NHBA and show that semantic relationships
are beneficial for BAA. Our previous work has shown
that gains in bilingual naming treatment can generalize to
semantically related words that are within- or betweenlanguage (Kiran et al., 2013) which lends support to
these findings. Furthermore, it appears that it is the
effect of semantic relationships that may drive the BAA
RTs to offer any resemblance to the expected outcomes
observed in the NHBA. In sum, these results suggest that
even if BAA stay within-language, which should require
less language control effort relative to moving betweenlanguages, the semantic relationships are crucial parts of
their ability to complete language tasks.
Conclusion
In this study we set out to explore mechanisms of
control and language processing in bilingual aphasia.
When results from the linguistic and non-linguistic
control tasks are examined in tandem, a dissociation
between the mechanisms of language control and general
cognitive control emerged in the data, thus offering
support for the model of domain specific cognitive
control. The findings from the present study offer strong
contributions to the corpus of bilingual aphasia literature,
and we acknowledge the importance of extending these
findings. In order to provide a more thorough examination
of language processing and executive functioning that
investigates how these processes overlap and breakdown,
additional linguistic and non-linguistic experimental
paradigms must be explored. Finally, since the patient
sample size is small, the conclusions we can draw are
limited. However, the fact that ten BAA are included in
the data set is compelling, and these data serve as a starting
point to evaluate patients by subgroups rather than single
cases.
