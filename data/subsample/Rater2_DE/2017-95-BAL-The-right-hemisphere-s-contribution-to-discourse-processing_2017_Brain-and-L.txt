Objective: Discourse skills - in which the right hemisphere has an important role - enables verbal communication by selecting contextually relevant information and integrating it coherently to infer the correct meaning. However, language research in epilepsy has focused on single word analysis related mainly
to left hemisphere processing. The purpose of this study was to investigate discourse abilities in patients
with right lateralized medial temporal lobe epilepsy (RTLE) by comparing their performance to that of
patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE).
Methods: 74 pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients were evaluated: 34 with RTLE and
40 with LTLE. Subjects underwent a battery of tests that measure comprehension and production of conversational and narrative discourse. Disease related variables and general neuropsychological data were
evaluated.
Results: The RTLE group presented deficits in interictal conversational and narrative discourse, with a disintegrated speech, lack of categorization and misinterpretation of social meaning. LTLE group, on the
other hand, showed a tendency to lower performance in logical-temporal sequencing.
Significance: RTLE patients showed discourse deficits which have been described in right hemisphere
damaged patients due to other etiologies. Medial and anterior temporal lobe structures appear to link
semantic, world knowledge, and social cognition associated areas to construct a contextually related
coherent meaning.

1. Introduction
Discourse skills imply the inference of meaning from larger
multi-sentence units called discourse: conversations, narrations
or instructions, rather than expressing or receiving isolated words
or sentences (AbdulSabur et al., 2014; Abusamra, Cote, Joanette, &
Ferreres, 2009; Johns, Tooley, & Traxler, 2008). Discourse study
enables society characterizes language functioning to its full
extent. Deficits in discourse processing affect interpersonal communication and text comprehension, and thus could impact the
whole educational career and social life (Cornoldi & Oakhill, 1996).

Processing discourse successfully requires building a mental
model that is maintained in an active fashion, being revised and
updated as new information becomes available (Johns et al.,
2008). This includes constructing a coherent microstructure - the
relationship between individual incoming sentences - and
macrostructure - the knowledge of the overarching message or
theme that organizes sentences into a unified whole - and making
the correct inferences about that which is not explicit (Johns et al.,
2008; Prat, Long, & Baynes, 2007). Thus, sentence information
meaning is integrated and combined with the prior discourse,
world knowledge, information about the speaker and semantic
information from extra-linguistic domains to get a message-level
representation (Hagoort & van Berkum, 2007).
In the last decades there has been an increasing interest in
studying how the right hemisphere (RH) contributes to communi-

cation and social skills. In patients with right brain hemisphere
damage (RHD) - due to stroke or head trauma - a wide range of language and communication deficits have been described at a discourse, pragmatic, lexico-semantic, and prosodic level (Abusamra
et al., 2009; Ferre, Fonseca, Ska, & Joanette, 2012; Ferre, Ska,
Lajoie, Bleau, & Joanette, 2011a; Johns et al., 2008). Ferre et al.
(2012) found that 50-78% of patients with RHD caused by stroke
lesions have language deficits. Regarding discourse skills in particular, patients with RHD produce less informative and coherent discourse than that of control subjects, while maintaining a similar
number of enunciations. In addition, these individuals often speak
tangentially (i.e. introducing personal digressions and critiques),
make inappropriate comments, and stray off topic (Abusamra
et al., 2009; Johns et al., 2008). At a receptive level, they fail to integrate elements of a story into a coherent whole and fail to infer the
correct pragmatic and social interpretations (Abusamra et al.,
2009; Ferre et al., 2012; Marini & Ph, 2012).
Until the last decades, the most widespread neurobiological
model for language was the classical left-perisylvian WernickeLichtheim-Geshwind model. This model is incomplete for several
reasons: lesion in both Broca's and Wernicke's region can impair
language production and comprehension, it does not describe
other relevant fiber tracts beyond the arcuate fasciculus, and does
not explain higher-order, language-communication skills that are
subserved throughout both hemispheres (Hagoort & Indefrey,
2014; Poeppel, Emmorey, Hickok, & Pylkkanen, 2012). Recent
approaches include a dual stream model (Hickok & Poeppel,
2004, 2007) which describes a dorsal phonological route (sounds
into words) mostly represented in the dominant hemisphere, and
a ventral semantic route (sounds into meaning) with bilateral representation. In the last years, evidence from functional neuroimaging methods enabled to describe other cortical and subcortical
areas involved in language (Price, 2012). Catani and Bambini
(2014) proposed a social communication and language evolution,
and development model (SCALED), that extends the dual-stream
model and includes frontal, fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal
networks. This model consists of five levels, from the representation of informative actions and communicative intentions, to
lexico-semantic processing, syntactic analysis and pragmatic
integration.
Although functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies in healthy population have shown broadly bilateral activation
of language attention and theory of mind-associated cortical areas
during discourse production and comprehension, some studies
have shown that inferring meaning from pragmatic and social contexts seems to be more represented at the right or non-dominant
hemisphere (AbdulSabur et al., 2014; Mar, 2011; Mason & Just,
2009; Swett et al., 2013). Theory of mind (ToM) - involves the construction of a theory concerning one's own or others' affective and
epistemic mental states - is one of complex social cognition abilities that contribute to construct mental representations of social
relations and to flexibly use them in the social environment
(Giovagnoli et al., 2011).
The anterior temporal lobes have been related to different functions such as being a domain-general semantic hub, having a
domain-specific role in social or `person-related' processing, being
a personal episodic and semantic memory store and mediating the
access to emotional and social contexts for meaning construction
(Baez, Rattazzi, Gonzalez-gadea, & Torralva, 2012; Kennedy &
Adolphs, 2012; Petrides, 2013; Price, 2012; Wong & Gallate, 2012).
Medial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent type
of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in young adults which can lead to
epilepsy surgery. It is described as a localized form of epilepsy that
involves brain networks of medial temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, uncus, parahipocampal gyrus, and the entorhinal cortex. The main cause of lesional TLE is the hippocampal sclerosis,

in over 80% of cases (Cendes, 2005; Tatum, 2012). The functional
and structural properties of the abnormal epileptogenic networks
and their anatomic location contribute to the defined electroclinical syndrome and the individual's clinical characteristics
(Bell, Lin, Seidenberg, & Hermann, 2011; Gleichgerrcht, Kocher, &
Bonilha, 2015; Hermann, Meador, Gaillard, & Cramer, 2010;
Richardson, 2012). The main goals of the neuropsychological evaluation in TLE are the detection of cognitive deficits and prediction
of cognitive surgical outcome (assessing functional integrity of the
tissue to be resected and cognitive reserve of the rest of the brain),
(McAndrews & Cohn, 2012).
Most of the previous literature about interictal language evaluation in TLE adults has focused on the production and comprehension of single word and sentence -level analysis, evaluating mainly
quantitative aspects of word production like semantic and phonologic fluency or naming abilities (Bartha-Doering & Trinka, 2014;
Bell, Seidenberg, Hermann, & Douville, 2003; Hamberger &
Tamny, 1999; Lomlomdjian, Solis, Medel, & Kochen, 2011;
Trebuchon Da Fonseca et al., 2009). Few studies have evaluated
conversational discourse (Bartha, Benke, Bauer, & Trinka, 2005;
Howell, Saling, Bradleyt, Samuel, & Hospital, 1994) and narrative
discourse production (Bell, Dow, Watson, Woodard, &
Seidenberg, 2003; Field, Saling, & Berkovic, 2000), but most of
them did not analyze the epileptic zone (EZ) laterality. Many recent
studies in TLE patients showed deficits in ToM abilities (Broicher
et al., 2012; Giovagnoli et al., 2011; Schacher et al., 2006), however
little is known about social communication abilities in this
population.
The goal of this study was to investigate discourse abilities in
patients with right lateralized medial temporal lobe epilepsy
(RTLE) by comparing their performance to that of patients with left
TLE (LTLE). Right hemisphere structures associated with discourse
performance may be affected by the EZ directly or indirectly and,
given reports in the RHD literature, they would be expected to produce interictal deficits in narrative and conversational discourse
abilities in RTLE patients.
2. Methods
2.1. Ethical approval and participants consent
All participants provided written informed consent approved by
the Institutional Ethics Committee at Ramos Mejia Hospital and El
Cruce Hospital, which follows the guidelines of the Declaration of
Helsinki.
2.2. Participants
From December 2011 to November 2015, 74 patients with
pharmacoresistant TLE and unequivocal lateralized EZ were
included for this study: 34 with a right epileptic zone (RTLE) and
40 with a left EZ (LTLE). Subjects were evaluated by the same professional team at the Epilepsy Center, Ramos Mejia Hospital, Buenos Aires and at the National Neuroscience and Neurosurgery
Center, El Cruce Nestor Carlos Kirchner Hospital, Florencio Varela,
both in Argentina.
Inclusive criteria were: subjects from 18 to 50 years-old, with at
least seven years of formal education (completed primary school in
Argentina), Full Scale IQ > 80, clearly defined EZ, and strong right
handedness determined by the Edinburgh Inventory and the
Grooved Pegboard Test (Lezak, 2012). Patients were not included
if they had history of psychiatric disorders, other neurological diseases, or a clinical condition that could modify cognitive performance. In order to determine lateralization and localization of
the EZ, video-EEG monitoring was performed in all patients over

C. Lomlomdjian et al. / Brain & Language 171 (2017) 31-41

a mean period of five days. A high-resolution Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) study with epilepsy protocol was conducted for
every patient.
TLE patients had early-onset disease (mean age 14.16 years; SD
9.75) and prolonged illness duration (mean 20.42 years; SD 12.26).
RTLE group was matched to LTLE group by sex (38 males, 36
females), age (mean: 34.75; SD 10.68), education (mean 12; SD
3.09), and general cognitive status (Total IQ mean 94.27, SD
12.69). There were no significant differences in the use of
antiepileptic drugs and seizure frequency between both groups
(see Table 1). MRI studies determined hippocampal sclerosis in
54 cases (31 LTLE/23 RTLE), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) subtype
II in three cases (2 LTLE/1 RTLE), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial
tumor (DNT) in five cases (2 LTLE/3 RTLE), cavernoma in one RTLE
patient and normal MRI in 11 cases (5 LTLE/6 RTLE). No statistical
differences were found regarding lesion type between TLE groups.
2.3. Neuropsychological protocols
We used previously validated tests that have normative values
for Argentine adult populations (Burin & Drake, 2007; Ferreres
et al., 2007; Goodglass, Kaplan, Barresi, 2005; Lomlomdjian et al.,
2011; Oddo, Consalvo, Silva, D'Alessio, & Kochen, 2003;
Weschler, 2006). The neuropsychological evaluation protocol was
completed during the video-EEG study period, was divided into
two or three sessions and had a total mean duration of six hours.
It was performed by one of three examiners who were blind to
TLE lateralization and other clinical information and were assigned
randomly to each case. Cognitive tests' written forms, verbatim
and video recordings were then scored by two independent examiners achieving high inter-rater reliability in all tests (Cohen's
kappa value 0.82). The results of the neuropsychological evaluation
were compared to those of the normal population matched for age,
sex, and formal education. For each patient, the raw values of the
cognitive tests were normalized to a Z score. A deficit or impairment in each test was established when performance was below
the Z 1.5 or below percentile 5.
2.3.1. General neuropsychological evaluation
A general neuropsychological assessment was performed
according to our Epilepsy Center Presurgical Protocol
(Lomlomdjian et al., 2011; Oddo et al., 2003). Evaluated cognitive
domains included: intelligence quotient estimation, attention,

2.3.2. Social cognition domain: Faux Pas test
This Theory of Mind test adapted to Spanish version (Burin &
Drake, 2007) was included to evaluate comprehension of social situations. Understanding a faux pas requires understanding both a
mental state of belief or knowledge and some empathic understanding of how the person in the story would feel (Stone,
Baron-cohen, & Knight, 1998). Subjects must recognize social faux
pas (FP) in 20 stories (ten with FP and ten without FP). The examiner reads each story out loud while the text remains in front of the
subject who can read it again whenever necessary. After, they must
answer the following questions to assess their recognition of FP:
``Did anyone say something they should not have said?'' and ``what
did he/she say?" If they answer ``yes'', they are asked these four
questions to measure understanding of social norms: 1. ``who said
something they should not have say?'' 2. ``Why should he/she not
have said that?" 3. ``Why did he/she say that?'' and 4. ``How did he/
she feel?'' Participants are then asked to answer two comprehension control questions to assess their understanding and retention
of contextual details. Detecting or rejecting FP correctly attracts 1
point per story (maximum 10 points for stories with and without
FP). Social norms comprehension questions (stories with FP) add
1 point, with a maximum score of 40 points. Comprehension control questions add 1 point each (for a maximum of 40 points). We
calculated a Theory of Mind Index = (FP total correct answers of
questions
``who" + ``what" + ``why" + non-FP
total
correct
answers)/maximum score of 40.
2.3.3. Discourse evaluation protocol
To evaluate discourse abilities we included four tests.
2.3.3.1. Conversational discourse subtest from the MEC protocol. The
purpose of this subtest from the Montreal Protocol for the Evaluation of Communication (MEC) (Joanette, Ska, & Cote, 2004) is to
examine verbal and non-verbal behavior in conversational situations, including the analysis of pragmatic aspects of discourse.
The test consists of a minimum of a ten-minute conversation,
between the patient and the examiner, on about two different
topics. Audio recorded conversations were then analyzed by two
examiners, considering the presence or absence of 19
communication-deficit behaviors which were scored on a 2-1-0
scale
(2 = communication-deficit
behavior
not
observed,
1 = behavior rarely observed or subtle and 0 = frequent or marked
behavior) with a maximum score of 38 points. The scale includes
the following components: lexico-semantic (e.g. two or more
anomias or paraphasic errors observed), conversational (e.g. misses
the conversation topic, e.g. does not respect the turn-talking), general pragmatic (does not understand indirect speech acts more
than once), discourse pragmatic (e.g. cannot express ideas clearly),
prosody (e.g. has a monotonous prosody) and extra-linguistic
aspects (e.g. eye-to-eye contact). We used the Spanish version of
the test validated by Ferreres et al. (2007).
2.3.3.2. Complex Ideational Material subtest (CIM) from the Boston
diagnostic aphasia examination - third edition. This test (Goodglass
et al., 2005) was included to evaluate auditory sentence and text
comprehension using paired questions with a yes or no answer.
This subtest has two parts. The first part consists of four sets of
paired questions, with complex grammatical constructions that
gradually increase in length (e.g. does a stone sink in water?/does
a cork sink in water?). The second part consists of eight paired
questions referring to four short stories (e.g. a story about someone
trying to arrive on time to take a train: did Mr. Lopez arrive on time
to take the train?/did Mr. Lopez lose the train? Both paired ques-

tions must be answered correctly to get one point and the maximum score is 12 (4 points for sentence comprehension and 8
points for text comprehension). In the third story of this test, we
also scored the presence or absence of the ability to detect mischievous behavior, which can be an indication of theory of mind
(a hotel guest that is carrying his own fire escape -a rope- might
leave without paying his bill).
2.3.3.3. Picture arrangement subtest (PA) from the Weschler adult
intelligence scale third edition (WAIS-III). This test (Weschler, 2006)
was included to evaluate logical-temporal sequencing. Subjects are
presented with a series of cards that are similar to comic strips,
which must be arranged in the correct order so as to create a
coherent story. In our protocol, all 11 stories were presented independent of performance, because we also analyzed narrative production. After ordering the cards, subjects were asked to narrate
the story and were scored on 0-1-2 scale, depending on whether
they could narrate the story's main components (1), as well as infer
the story's meaning (2), or not reach sufficient criteria to score (0).
A Story Index was calculated by dividing the narrative score (maximum of 22 points), by the sequencing score (maximum of 22
points).
2.3.3.4. Narrative discourse subtest from MEC protocol. This subtest
from MEC protocol (Ferreres et al., 2007; Joanette et al., 2004) aims
at examining partial and integrated narrative comprehension,
retelling, and Theory of Mind (ToM). Theory of Mind refers to the

ability to attribute internal mental states to others, as well as reasoning about one's own mental state. To understand the interactions of characters in a story, the subject has to attribute
thoughts, goals and intentions to the characters (Mason & Just,
2009). The examiner reads a narrative text divided into five paragraphs. After each paragraph is read, the subject must retell it in
his or her own words. Then the text is read again in the integral
version and the subject must be able to retell it from start to finish.
When retelling the complete story, macrostructural aspects (e.g.
the context of the story, the trigger element, consequences, reactions, etc.) are considered and only main ideas are scored (with a
maximum of 13 points) in contrast to irrelevant details of the narration. In addition, 12 text-interpretation questions (maximum of
12 points) and social inference processing (presence or absence)
are included.
2.4. Statistical analysis
TLE groups were matched for age, sex, and years of education.
Raw scores were converted to Z-values and were also classified
into either ``normal" or ``deficient" performance. Kolmogorov-
Smirnov analyses were performed and four cognitive variables violated normality: Inverse digit span (z = 1.51, p = 0.022), Wisconsin
card sorting test-categories (z = 1.56, p = 0.017), Rey auditory verbal learning test-recognition (z = 1.91, p < 0.001), and Rey complex
figure-copy (z = 1.73, p = 0.005). The rest of the variables had normal distribution. We compared discourse performance by lesion

35

laterality groups (RTLE vs. LTLE) and with other cognitive domains,
clinical and demographic variables. According to each variable type
and distribution we used Student's t-test or Mann Whitney U test
Pearson and Spearman correlation tests, contingency tables, Chisquare test, and binary logistic regression analysis. Bonferroni correction for family wise errors type I was performed to establish the
statistical significance level. All comparisons that were significant
at the p < 0.001 were reported. Statistical analysis was carried
out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 20).
3. Results
3.1. General neuropsychological assessment
Within the general neuropsychological evaluation, shown in
Table 2, we observed in TLE population frequent impairment in
most of the cognitive domains, especially in executive functions,
social cognition, memory and language tasks. No significant differences were found between RTLE and LTLE patients both at raw
scores and performance level comparisons except for social cognition domain which is described below (Table 2).
3.2. Social cognition domain: Faux Pas test
TLE patients showed frequent deficits in this social cognition
task (56.7%), with a tendency to be more frequent in RTLE group
(LTLE 42.5% vs RTLE 73.5%, X2 = 8.069 (1) p = 0.007) and Theory
of Mind index was significantly lower in RTLE group (t = 4.09
(47.1) p < 0.001) (Table 2). Detection of faux pas stories was significantly lower in RTLE group (t = 3.82 (62) p < 0.001) while no differences were found in non-faux pas stories rejection. In
addition, comprehension and interpretation of social situations laterality effect being poorer in RTLE group with a tendency to give
erroneous or literal interpretations: ``Why did the person say
that?" (LTLE mean score 6.83 SD 1.72) vs RTLE mean score 3.93
SD 2.08, t = 4.79 (68) p < 0.001) and ``Why should he/she not have
said that?" (LTLE mean score 7.82 SD 1.19 vs RTLE mean score 6.06
SD 2.27, t = 4.26 (45.8) p < 0.001), (see Appendix A.5).
3.3. Discourse evaluation protocol
3.3.1. Conversational Discourse test
The evaluation of conversational discourse showed that RTLE
patients compared to LTLE patients had significantly lower scores
in (t = 4.59 (40.4) p < 0.001) (Table 3) and poorer performance as
73.5% of RTLE vs. 20% of LTLE patients showed deficits in this task
(X2 = 23.16 (1) p < 0.001) (Table 4). The most frequent communication behaviors observed were difficulties to keep the discourse
theme and stay on topic, difficulties to express ideas in a concise
way, and to comprehend indirect and metaphoric language (see
Appendix A.1 for an example). Some patients (5 cases) also showed
poor eye-to-eye contact and a monotonous prosody. The LTLE
group showed lower scores only if anomias or a difficulty to initiate speech or take turns was found; otherwise performance was
normal.
3.3.2. Complex Ideational Material test
We observed oral comprehension difficulties (at different complexities: from sentence to text comprehension) in 48.6% of TLE
patients, with no significant differences regarding EZ laterality. In
the third story, the inference of social meaning was significantly
worse in RTLE patients, deficient in 41.2% of subjects vs. 7.5% in
LTLE group (X2 = 13.75 (1) p < 0.001) (see Appendix A.2 for an
example). Failure in social meaning inference determined deficient

3.3.3. Picture Arrangement test
When we measured logical-temporal sequencing, almost 30% of
TLE patients showed deficits in placing the different parts of the
story in the correct order. LTLE patients showed a tendency to
lower scores in this task (t = 2.25 (63) p = 0.028) and higher
amount of cases with deficient performance (LTLE 45% vs. 11.7%)
(X2 = 7.31 (1) p = 0.008) as shown in Tables 3 and 4. In contrast,
RTLE compared to LTLE, in narrative production showed a tendency
to lower scores (t = 2.65 (41) p = 0.011) and a statistically significant worst performance given that 73.5% (25 cases) of RTLE vs.
22.5% (9 cases) failed in this task (X2 = 14.36 (1) p < 0.000). This
inverse behavior was observed also when comparing the Story
Index (narrative score/sequencing score), with a trend towards
lower scores for RTLE group compared to LTLE group (t = 3.12
(41) p = 0.003) (Table 3). In RTLE patients we observed difficulties
for telling core components, interpreting the meaning of a story,
and a tendency to add non-existent information (see Appendix
A.3 for an example).

3.3.4. Narrative Discourse test
TLE patients failed to accurately retell core components of the
entire story in 28% of cases. The RTLE group compared to the LTLE
group showed a tendency to obtain lower scores (t = 2.60 (62)
p = 0.011) and a higher percentage of deficient performances when
producing these macrostructural elements (50% vs. 27.5%;
X2 = 5.60 (1) p = 0.029) (Tables 3 and 4). We observed that RTLE
patients were not able to organize information hierarchically;
rather, they produced secondary details or extra information (see
Appendix A.4 for an example). The structured questionnaire
revealed that 50% of TLE had deficient scores and no significant differences were found between groups (Table 3). Specific laterality
effect was observed in inferring the story's social meaning, as none
of LTLE patients had failed in this task, while 38.2% (13 cases) of
RTLE patients did (X2 = 16.47 (1) p < 0.001) (Table 4).

3.4. Statistical analysis of clinical demographic and cognitive findings
3.4.1. Correlation analysis
Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated according to each variable's distribution, to determine the
association between discourse performance and clinical, demographic and other cognitive variables. Lower education level correlated
with
a
poor
logic-temporal
sequencing
in
Picture Arrangement (Pearson's r 0.409, p < 0.001). No other significant correlations were found between discourse protocol and education level, however, Narrative and Conversational Discourse
subtests from MEC were already adjusted by education ( or
>10 years of formal education). No other demographic or clinical
variable was significantly associated with discourse performance.
Regarding the analysis with other cognitive domains included
in the general neuropsychological evaluation, Verbal IQ level
showed correlation with verbal comprehension (Total CIM task:
Pearson's r 0.372, p = 0.002), while Executive IQ correlated with
logic-temporal sequencing ability (Picture Arrangement: Pearson's
r 0.421, p < 0.001). In addition, verbal memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall-list A7) correlated with Narrative
Discourse core information production (Spearman's r 0.275,
p = 0.028). Executive functions analysis revealed correlation with
Picture Arrangement test - logic-temporal sequencing with TMT
B (Spearman's r 0.340, p = 0.009) and with WCST perseverative
errors (Spearman's r 0.412, p = 0.003), while Picture Arrangement
test - narrative production task correlated with WCST nonperseverative errors (Spearman's r 0.373, p = 0.012). Moreover,
executive abilities correlated with social situation comprehension
abilities: TMT B with social inference - CIM test (Spearman's r
0.362, p = 0.009) and WCST- categories and non-perseverative
errors with Faux Pas test- ToM Index (Spearman's r 0.355,
p = 0.008 and r 0.304, p = 0.003 respectively). Finally, social cognition Faux Pas test (ToM Index) correlated with Conversational Discourse test (Pearson's r 0.407, p =< 0.001) Narrative Discourse -
core information production (Pearson's r 0.455, p =< 0.001) and
Picture Arrangement- narrative production task (Pearson's r
0.384, p = 0.004).
3.4.2. Logistic regression
Variables that showed significant correlations were selected
and included for regression analysis. Binary logistic regression
analysis was performed to evaluate: 1. Right epileptic zone laterality prediction, 2. Deficient discourse outcome prediction (deficit  1.5 SD). Cognitive variables (general neuropsychological
and discourse protocol tests) were dichotomized according to deficient performance (deficit  1.5 SD), except for IQ which was

dichotomized into low (IQ 80-89) or high (IQ  90) performance.
Dichotomous clinical variables included for logistic regression
were: epileptic zone laterality (left vs. right), early epilepsy onset
(12 years old), prolonged illness duration (10 years) and low
education level (10 years or incomplete secondary school).
First, logistic regression analysis confirmed lateralizing value of
discourse abilities evaluation. Right epileptic zone laterality was
predicted by a deficient performance in Conversational discourse
task (B = 2.54, Wald = 20.18, p < 0.001, OR 12.75); CIM test social inference (B = 2.31, Wald = 11.01, p < 0.001, OR 10.11), Picture Arrangement - narrative production task (B = 3.78,
Wald = 11.48, p < 0.001, OR 9.33), Narrative Discourse - core information production (B = 1.16, Wald = 5.42, p < 0.020, OR 3.19), and
social inference tasks (B = 1.87, Wald = 8.63, p = 0.003, OR 6.51)
(Table 5a).
Second, logistic regression analysis with covariates was used to
evaluate the influence that other clinical variables cognitive
domains could have on discourse performance deficient outcome
other than right epileptic zone laterality. This analysis revealed
that in narrative discourse comprehension and production tasks
right epileptic zone laterality predicted a deficient outcome, but
discourse performance was also influenced to a lesser extent by
deficits in other cognitive domains. Deficits in verbal memory
(RAVLT list A7 delayed recall: B = 1.56, Wald = 6.69, p = 0.010)
and social cognition (ToM index Faux Pas test: B = 1.41,
Wald = 4.25, p = 0.039) predicted Narrative Discourse test - core
information deficient production, while social inference failure in
this test was predicted by deficits in executive functions (TMT B
test: B = 2.98, Wald = 5.69, p = 0.017). Also, deficits in social cognition influenced narrative production in Picture Arrangement test
(ToM index Faux Pas test: B = 1.91, Wald = 4.84, p = 0.028)
(Table 5b).
No other cognitive or clinically correlated variables survived
regression analysis.

4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate narrative and conversational discourse skills in patients with right lateralized medial
TLE compared to LTLE patients. We found poorer performance and
more frequent discourse deficits in the right group compared to the
left one.
Regarding discourse production, we observed deficits in categorizing information in a hierarchical order, keeping the main information as a guide (i.e., macrostructure management), expressing
ideas concisely and, in some cases, a tendency to a disintegrated,

self-referential, and excessively detailed speech as seen in the Narrative and Conversational Discourse Tests and the narrative production task of the Picture Arrangement Test. Our findings
concur with what was described by Field and collaborators (Field
et al., 2000) and Bell and collaborators (Bell et al., 2003) who found
narrative production deficits in English-speaking TLE populations,
with difficulties in speaking concisely and recounting a story's core
information, although hemisphere laterality of the EZ was not
taken into account in their investigations. Also, our findings agree
with descriptions in other RH lesional pathologies that showed
uninformative discourse dissociated from lexical or syntactic
impairments (Ferre et al., 2012; Joanette et al., 2008) with tangential speech that lacks thematic progression (Johns et al., 2008).
Both RTLE and LTLE individuals had a poor performance in verbal fluency and naming tasks, a finding that has been widely
described in this population, although the lateralization value of
these deficits remains controversial (Bartha-Doering & Trinka,
2014). At spontaneous speech evaluation in the Conversational
Discourse Test, LTLE patients who had lower scores presented
anomias and poor verbal fluency. This coincides with a previous

study from Howell RA (Howell et al., 1994) who described poorer
fluency and longer pauses during speech in LTLE patients compared to RTLE group. Even though in TLE patients as a whole we
found deficits in naming and fluency tasks, the performance in
word level analysis did not correlate with spontaneous speech during complex communicative situations where other executive,
attentional, and linguistic processes can be implied.
LTLE patients also had a trend towards having more difficulties
to arrange a sequential story in the right order (in the Picture Arrangement Test). However, even if the story was sequenced
incorrectly, LTLE patients could still retain important information,
infer the appropriate meaning and explain a story coherently
unlike RTLE patients (see Appendix C). Logical-temporal sequencing abilities like this one have been described as a left hemisphere
function as seen in lexical and motor sequencing tasks (Heim et al.,
2012) and in tasks where rearrangement of materials sequentially
based on linguistic-conceptual rules are required (Chan, Ryan, &
Bever, 2013). As far as we know, this is the first time this deficit
has been described in epilepsy patients.

When we evaluated discourse comprehension, RTLE patients
showed deficits in meaning inference processing especially for
social meaning (e.g., detecting mischievous behavior, faux pas).
Even when general information was comprehended correctly, RTLE
patients gave inaccurate interpretations as observed in the CIM,
Narrative Discourse Test and Faux Pas Test (ToM index and faux
pas stories questions ``Why" and ``Why not"). These results coincide with many previous studies of RHD patients that show comprehension deficits due to distorted inference processing in the
RH, where patients cannot extract the correct or most relevant global meaning from stories, figurative expressions, indirect speech
acts, or facial and vocal cues (Blake, 2009; Joanette et al., 2008;
Johns et al., 2008; Marini & Ph, 2012). While there are similarities
with our findings, other studies with RHD patients involve different pathophysiological basis and lesion sites variability, which
encompasses in most of cases fronto-temporal cortical and subcortical areas and does not include medial temporal lobe.
Mechanisms underlying discourse deficits have been controversial. There could be a combination of overlapping deficits in
macrostructure management and an impairment of inference processing. Regarding macrostructure elements management most
authors suggested that RHD patients would remain sensitive to
main ideas - that rely on explicit information related to
macrostructure - but may be impaired in their ability to use them
to create an organizing macrostructure, extract implicit information or use such elements to integrate context and previous knowledge (Joanette et al., 2008; Johns et al., 2008). In our study, we
found that macrostructure impairments were associated with
executive and memory difficulties (e.g. mental flexibility - inhibition abilities correlated with logic-temporal sequencing Picture Arrangement test, or WCST-categorization and verbal
memory abilities correlated with narrative production in Picture Arrangement and Narrative Discourse tests) which would lead
to deficits in keeping and organizing macrostructure elements,
while context integration and pragmatic use of language would
be the distinctive role in language processing of the right hemisphere. Concerning inference processing, one prevailing view is
that the right hemisphere activates broader semantic fields than
the left hemisphere, which produces a fast and selective semantic
activation (Jung-Beeman, 2005). In RHD patients there would be a
deficit that prevent information to activate meanings and to detect
thematic information (Jung-Beeman, 2005). Another view is the
Suppression Deficit Theory, which states that there is a deficit in
suppressing multiple-competing meanings that are initially activated and represented, but are eventually irrelevant or incompatible (Basnakova, Weber, Petersson, van Berkum, & Hagoort, 2013;
Blake, 2009). Our findings demonstrated that inference ability
was particularly impaired in RTLE patients and was associated
social cognition and executive deficits (e.g. Social CIM correlation
with TMT B, Faux Pas test correlation with WCST-categorization
and with narrative tests- Picture Arrangement and Narrative Discourse). RTLE patients would therefore neither be able to keep
alternative meanings active and select the appropriate one according to the context, nor detect the main theme or conclusions of the
discourse.
Regarding the relation between discourse and social cognition
deficits, we found that misunderstanding a story's social meaning
was significantly lateralized to RTLE, as seen in both linguistically
simple and complex tests (CIM, Narrative Discourse, and Faux
Pas tests). Both groups showed deficits in the Faux Pas Test, as previously described by other authors (Broicher et al., 2012;
Giovagnoli et al., 2011; Schacher et al., 2006). Although TLE
patients as a whole had poor performance in a high-order ToM test
like the Faux Pas Test, RTLE group had significant differences in the
ability to detect and interpret faux pas stories (social situation
comprehension ``why" and ``why not" questions), while non faux

pas stories rejection showed no differences. Evidence from ToM
studies in TLE using non-verbal inputs suggested that some social
cognition processing could be affected in this population (Broicher
et al., 2012; Schacher et al., 2006), while pragmatic aspects of language related to RH processing could also explain these deficits
(Frank, 2010).
The ToM network is involved in many discourse-related tasks used to infer implicit meaning from what is actually written or said
(Hagoort & Indefrey, 2014). RTLE can affect networks beyond the
medial temporal lobe (Hermann et al., 2010). Difficulties in comprehending and retelling stories, as well as inferring the social
meaning of stories (e.g. recognizing faux pas) can be explained
by dysfunctions in circuits that include the right temporoparietal junction, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, which have been seen to subserve
narrative discourse (AbdulSabur et al., 2014) and a ToMprotagonist perspective network (Mason & Just, 2009). This network seems to generate expectations about how the protagonists
of stories will act on the basis of understanding their intentions
(Hagoort & Indefrey, 2014; Mason & Just, 2009). The SCALED model
(Catani & Bambini, 2014) also refers to these networks at a prefrontal dorsolateral network (level 2), involved in communicative
intentions and inference processing, and a temporo-parietal network (level 5) related to pragmatic integration and high level social
cognition.
In our study, discourse deficits showed laterality effect beyond
the influence of executive function and theory of mind, as shown in
logistic regression analysis. This finding could be due to the role
the right hemisphere has on discourse processing, by the integration of these functions to pragmatic use of language. Several quantitative imaging and neurophysiological studies suggested that in
TLE structural and functional network abnormalities (e.g. gray
matter volume loss, white tracts integrity, cortical reorganization,
functional connectivity) extend beyond mesial temporal areas to
neocortical parietal, temporal and frontal areas as well as thalamus
(Bell et al., 2011; Gleichgerrcht et al., 2015; Richardson, 2012).
Right medial and anterior temporal lobe structures and their connections seem to have a key role in discourse comprehension. The
potentially affected networks would involve temporal anterior and
medial areas, posterior temporal areas (Superior Temporal Gyrus
and Superior Temporal Sulcus), and prefrontal areas related to
communication, domain-general semantic integration, and
domain-specific social-related processing (AbdulSabur et al.,
2014; Mar, 2011; Wong & Gallate, 2012). These regions link areas
associated to semantics, world knowledge, and social cognition,
resulting in the construction of a coherent context (Catani &
Bambini, 2014; Wong & Gallate, 2012).
We should note a number of possible limitations to this study.
The study included patients who have prolonged illness and use
multiple antiepileptic drugs. While no cognitive differences were
found between patients using or not Topiramate, patients were
not evaluated before and after they use that drug. Patients with
other lesions than hippocampal sclerosis were quite small and prevented us from splitting the sample into subgroups according to
the lesion type. Functional impact and professional-academic outcome was not measured. As it is known, epilepsy has a social burden that exceeds cognitive impairments. Therefore, we considered
it important to assess quality of life and social impact in objective
and subjective ways, and will incorporate an anthropology project
in future studies.

5. Conclusions
Our results allow us to provide additional evidence of the right
temporal lobe's important involvement in discourse processing.

C. Lomlomdjian et al. / Brain & Language 171 (2017) 31-41

RTLE patients presented deficits in comprehending central ideas,
making adequate inferences, and expressing themselves concisely
and coherently.
The anterior temporal lobe seems to process information that is
personally relevant as a domain-general semantic hub with a bias
towards social information (Wong & Gallate, 2012). Therefore, the
impairment of the anterior temporal lobe could cause deficits in
social inference-making, as well as conversational discourse where
personal information is particularly relevant. Furthermore, the
bilateral temporal poles have been seen to play a role in generating
specific semantic associations in text comprehension in fMRI studies (Swett et al., 2013). Given our findings, the right medial and
anterior temporal lobe regions - which would partake in a broader
semantic activation (Jung-Beeman, 2005) - and their connections
to a ToM-protagonist network seem to be critical in linking areas
associated to semantics, world knowledge, and social cognition,
which would enable the construction of a coherent context and
suitable inference-making (Basnakova et al., 2013; Mar, 2011;
Mason & Just, 2009).
The complex nature of discourse makes it difficult for patients
to be fully aware of these deficits, even though they produce significant impairments in communication and text comprehension,
which weakens educational and professional opportunities. Certain deficits in discourse processing were more frequent than other
known general cognitive impairments in temporal lobe epilepsy.
Conversational and narrative discourse deficits showed epileptic
zone lateralization value and could help in epilepsy surgery decision making. It is therefore important to evaluate these skills in
RTLE patients to detect potential deficits and offer discourse therapy if necessary (Cornoldi and Oakhill, 1996; Ferre, Ska, Lajoie,
Bleau, & Joanette, 2011b). For future research, we will compare
TLE patients' pre- and post-surgical treatment and measure other
pragmatic aspects of language with neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging methods.

Appendix A
A.1. Conversational Discourse test
1. Sample from the Conversational Discourse Test of participant
A.M. who has RTLE, which shows a fluent but tangential, disintegrated speech with difficulties in both expressing ideas in a concise
way and in turn-taking (the ellipses points indicate pauses during
speech):
Examiner: You told me that at the beginning of your seizures
you sometimes have a pleasant feeling. What is that feeling like?
Could you describe it a bit more?

39

A.M.: I used to have it at school and wouldn't tell anyone. It
didn't seem bad. Then it became more frequent, and I had a seizure
and that's when they diagnosed me.
Examiner: And what was that feeling like? What is it similar to?
A.M.: That was before. . . when I was about eight. At that age I
used to like to play soccer. . . that's how it was. . . One day, while
playing soccer, it happened. I didn't have problems at school [the
participant goes on to talk about his classmates and his academic
performance, which is left out in this sample]. I had good grades
until I had 10 seizures in a single day but. . . because I didn't have
medication; it was hard for me to get it. I had a test. Math? Uh, I
don't remember. . . And that changed me, it was before and after
[sic]. . . From then on, it was hard for me to concentrate. . . Wait,
what?. . . Oh! The feeling I have during seizures. . . It was something nice. It would happen at school. . . It was like--I don't know. . .
It's hard for me to explain. . . I had them [pleasant feelings] from 8
to 12. If you tell, they don't believe you. People don't believe kids. . .
What was that saying from the story?. . . From the fable where if
you lie then they won't believe you? I don't know. I think it was
different when I was older, uh. . . Then I left college because everything was twice the effort. Now I regret it a bit. . . Although I
shouldn't regret it, right? You do what you can. It was very difficult
back then!
Examiner: Do you remember what the feeling was like when
the seizures started?
A.M.: Oh! I don't know. It was something similar to that. . .
nice. . . although, it rarely happens now.
2. Sample from the Conversational Discourse Test of participant
G.F. who has RTLE that shows difficulties in interpreting indirect
language and humor:
Examiner: Hello, I'm sorry for the delay. Would you like some
coffee? My treat.
G.F.: I had breakfast and was told that a doctor would come see
me. Was I supposed to fast?
Examiner: No, I'm just offering you something to drink, and I
apologize for the delay.
G.F.: Are you asking me out, doctor?
Examiner: No [the examiner giggles]. I mean to say that I'll pay
for the coffee if you would like one, to compensate you for my
delay.
G.F.: Oh. . . I saw the wedding ring, thought it was weird. Why
are you laughing?
Examiner: I'm surprised by what you said.
G.F.: So you're not married? Do you wear a fake wedding ring to
scare off men? [said seriously in a confused manner].

A.2. Complex Ideational Material test
1. Example of a deficit in comprehending social intention by
participant H.F. who has RTLE. The third story is about a man
who enters the hotel carrying a suitcase and rope. The employee
asks what the rope is for. The guest answers that the rope is his
own emergency exit. The employee then requires him to pay his
hotel stay up front.
Standard questions:
Did the client arrive with anything unusual?
H.F.: Yes.
Did the hotel employee trust this guest?
H.F.: Yes.
H.F. is then asked why he thought the guest was asked to pay up
front. H.F. responds: ``Nowadays you have to be careful, people
don't want to pay. It's better to charge before and be safe." The
examiner asks: ``Why do you think the guest brought a rope?" H.
F. responds: ``Maybe he wanted to hang his clothes. . . or rob a
bank. I don't know, everyone does what they want."

40

C. Lomlomdjian et al. / Brain & Language 171 (2017) 31-41

Participant V.C. who has LTLE answers that the employee did
not trust the guest. When asked why, V.C. answered: ``Because
he was carrying a rope and thought he might not pay." The examiner asked: ``Why? Why do you think he brought the rope?" V.C.
replied: ``To escape without paying or to commit suicide. . . The
story doesn't say. That's what I think."
A.3. Picture Arrangement test
Example of story FUGA (i.e. ``escape" in English), which has four
pictures that must be placed in the correct order to tell a story.
Correct sequence:
First picture F: two police officers are searching for an escaped
prisoner who is hiding behind a bush.
Second picture U: the prisoner is spying on a woman, who is
bathing in the river. Her dress is laid out on the shore.
Third picture G: the male prisoner puts her dress on while she
bathes in the river. His clothes are now on the shore.
Fourth picture A: the prisoner, dressed as a woman, is chased by
two female police officers. The dress has a number on the backside.
Example of a poorly sequenced (0 points) and well narrated performance (2 points):
UFGA sequence: ``A prisoner is escaping, and the police are
chasing him. He's hiding behind trees and saw a women bathing
in the river. He found her clothes and exchanged them for his.
He put the women's dress on and started running. But the other
police officers found him." The examiner asks why and the participant answers: ``Because the woman in the river was also a
fugitive."
Example of a well sequenced (2 points) and poorly narrated
performance (0 points):
FUGA sequence: ``A man runs. The police follow him. The police
officers leave, and he's spying on a women who is bathing in the
river. He also wants to bathe. But when he comes out of the water,
he gets confused and puts the women's clothes on and the women
[police officers] chase him. The examiner asks why and the participant answers: So that he returns the clothes.
A.4. Narrative Discourse test
This test separates main ideas from secondary information.
Main ideas include 13 items within a frame (1. a man named John;
2. he digs a hole; 3. he is almost finished), a conflict (4. the hole
caves in), an internal plan (5. he has an idea/strategy), the plan's
execution (6. he leaves his clothes near the hole; 7. he hides his
tools; 8. he climbs a tree), the consequences (9. the neighbor thinks
he's buried in the caved-in hole; 10. he asks for help; 11. the neighbors dig out the caved-in hole), and the reactions (12. John climbs
down the tree; 13. He thanks his neighbors).
Example of how participant C.V., who has LTLE, retold the story:
``The farmer, John, is digging a hole. The next day, he comes up to
the hole and sees it's half-filled with dirt. He has an idea: He puts
his hat and shirt near the hole's edge, he hides his pick and shovel,
and climbs up a tree. A neighbor passes by to talk, and when he
sees the clothes he gets scared and thinks he's buried in the hole. . .
and calls the other neighbors. They start digging the hole to find
John. . . When John sees they're finished emptying out the hole,
he climbs down the tree and says thank you and that they were
a big help. . . because they did his job." Score: 12 of 13.
Examiner: What did you think of John's approach?
C.V.: He betrayed his friends to get out of doing his own work;
[it was] wrong.
Examiner: What title would you give this story?
C.V.: John, the con artist.

Example of how participant C.A., who has RTLE, retold the story:
``John one morning went to work and to make a hole. He made a
pretty deep hole on his farm. The next day, in the early morning,
when he went to see it [the hole]. . . the hole caved in, and the hole
was completely covered with dirt. . . He stopped to think for a
while. He left his clothes and hat, the pick and the shovel in the
hole. A neighbor came by to talk to him, because they were friends,
and saw the clothes and that John was at the bottom of the hole. He
started screaming to save him. They came to rescue him, and John
said thank you very much to the neighbors for helping him." Score:
7/13.
Examiner: What did you think of John's approach?
C.A.: He was thankful. The neighbors were probably really
scared.
Examiner: What title would you give this story?
C.A.: John, the farmer.
A.5. Social cognition: Faux Pas test
Example of a faux pas story and corresponding questions:
Julia just moved to her new apartment. She had bought new
curtains for her bedroom. When she was finished decorating her
apartment, her best friend Alice arrived. Julia showed her around
the apartment and asked: ``Do you like my bedroom?" Alice
answered: ``Those curtains are horrible. I hope you change them
for some new ones."
Questions answered by RTLE patients C.M.:
Examiner: Did anyone say something they shouldn't have said
or something awkward?
C.M.: Yes
Examiner: Who said something they shouldn't have said or
something awkward?
C.M.: Alice.
Examiner: What did she say?
C.M.: That the curtains were horrible, and that she should
change them for new ones.
Examiner: Why did she say it?
C.M.: The friend had bad taste, and she [Alice] was mad she
[Julia] had a new house.
Other answers to the last question by patients with RTLE:
G.F.: Envy makes you lose friends.
G.L.: She [Alice] probably felt superior. Ha! A decorator.
An answer to the last question of a patient with LTLE:
F.M.: She didn't realize they were new. Since she thought they
were ugly, she told her she better change them and buy some
new ones. It wasn't on purpose.
