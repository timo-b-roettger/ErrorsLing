ABSTRACT
Language use and joint attention (JA) strategies were examined during interactions between francophone mothers and fathers and either their birth children (n = 10) or their internationally adopted
children from China (n = 8), once when the children were 15 months old and again at 20 months, on
average. Results showed that mothers engaged in more JA episodes and tended to talk more with their
children than did fathers; however, this was influenced by the language-learning situation of the child.
Specifically, the adoptive parents engaged more with their children than did the birth parents, and the
behaviors of the internationally adopted mothers and fathers were more similar to each other than
to those of the birth parents, arguably to support their children's unique language-learning situation.
However, in contrast to a previous study that examined JA with adoptive mothers, the adoptive fathers'
interaction styles with their children at 15 months were not related to children's vocabularies at 20
months as has been observed for mothers.

It is becoming increasingly evident that the nature and quantity of input children
are exposed to during early language acquisition can play an important role in their
language development and even ultimate attainment (e.g., Hoff, 2006). In particular, it has been found that input during episodes of joint attention (JA) between
children and their parents plays a role in children's early language learning (e.g.,
Dominey & Dodane, 2004; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986). At the same time, input

during JA is subject to variation that is linked on one hand to the learning environment and on the other hand to characteristics of language learners themselves.
However, the nature of this variation, as well as its potential effect on language
learning, has received little attention to date. In the present study, we sought to
examine potential differences in JA linked to variation in the learning environment associated with differences between mothers' and fathers' communication
styles. Virtually all children, with the possible exception of children in one-parent
families, learn language from both parents; thus, differences in how mothers and
fathers engage in JA are important to consider (e.g., Davidson & Snow, 1996;
Dopke, 1992; Leaper, Anderson, & Sanders, 1998). However, possible mother-
father differences in input during episodes of JA have not been investigated to
date because there is no research that has examined JA in fathers, the focus of the
present study. We concomitantly examined differences in JA linked to differences
in learners' backgrounds. We did this by studying parental interactions between
young children learning language from their birth parents in contrast to internationally adopted (IA) children acquiring a second first language from adoptive
parents. IA children are interesting because they experience delayed exposure to
the adopted language and, as a result, have levels of proficiency in that language
that are lower than their chronological and mental age. Thus, we were able to
examine how parents adjust their language input in general and their JA strategies
in particular as a function of reduced language exposure and proficiency.
JA AND MONOLINGUAL LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT

JA is defined as the ability to coordinate attention between people and objects for
social purposes (Tomasello, 1988). Typical JA behaviors include general abilities
such as following an adult's gaze or drawing attention to an object by pointing
(Watt, Wetherby, & Shumway 2006). The emergence of JA generally occurs between 9 and 18 months of age and is associated with early-stage language learning,
when children quickly acquire the vocabulary of their native language (Carpenter,
Nagell, & Tomasello, 1998). It has been argued that joint focus of attention between
a child and an adult acts as a scaffold for children's early language development,
particularly lexical acquisition, because JA provides children with an environment
rich in vocabulary related to their current focus of attention during a period of
development when they are in the early stages of language acquisition. Several
theoretical accounts posit that JA may even be a necessary precursor for the earliest
phases of word learning, arguing that when a child and a caregiver jointly focus on
an object or event, the child learns both what words refer to and how they are used
within a communicative context (Akhtar & Tomasello, 2000; Tomasello, 1988;
Tomasello & Farrar, 1986; Tomasello & Todd, 1983).
There is some evidence to support this argument in studies that have examined
the relationship between children's early JA experiences and their subsequent language abilities, especially their vocabulary development. For example, Tomasello
and Farrar (1986) showed that the more often mothers referred to objects that
were the focus of their 15-month-old children's attention, and the longer they
spent within each of these JA episodes, the larger their children's vocabulary
size 6 months later. This was also found to be true for children's ability to learn

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5

1225

novel words. That is to say, children remembered novel words presented in the
context of JA more often than those presented outside of the child's attentional
focus. Similarly, Tomasello and Todd (1983) found that the longer the duration
of mothers' JA episodes with their 1-year-old children, the larger their children's
vocabulary sizes 5 months later. However, simply providing longer episodes of
JA may not be sufficient to enhance lexical acquisition. Morales et al. (2000)
found that children's responsiveness to JA is also important. More specifically,
they showed that children between 6 and 18 months of age who were more likely
to turn their head or gaze toward their mother's voice or actions also had greater
expressive and receptive vocabulary abilities at 24 and 30 months of age. Moreover,
the 12- to 16-month-old children who were better able to direct their caregiver's
attention had greater expressive language abilities between 18 and 22 months. In
contrast, it has been found that children who are impaired at engaging in JA, or who
spend shorter amounts of time engaged in JA, not only have smaller vocabularies
but also exhibit slower syntactic development (e.g., Dominey & Dodane, 2004;
Harris, Kasari, & Sigman, 1996; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986).
Although there is evidence supporting the association between JA and language
development in general, evidence also indicates that the nature of parent-child
interactions during JA vary and can be differentially influential in their children's development. In particular, parental use of the "follow-in" style, which
occurs when caregivers follow children's attentional focus and comment on or
label the object present in their environment, is generally associated with larger
vocabularies in children, at least in families with Western cultural backgrounds.
In contrast, the use of "redirect strategies," wherein caregivers attempt to redirect a child's attention from their current focus of attention to another object
or event, has been associated with lower vocabulary scores (e.g., Tomasello &
Farrar, 1986). Arguably, the follow-in strategy is more "child-centered" in that it
supports and builds on the child's current focus of attention and/or engagement
(e.g., Dopke, 1992). However, there is evidence that the use of redirections does
not always impede vocabulary acquisition. Shimpi and Huttenlocher (2007) found
that successful redirections were positively associated with children's language
outcomes, while unsuccessful redirections, when parents were not actually able to
change their child's attentional focus, were negatively associated with children's
vocabulary outcomes.
CULTURE AND JA

At the same time, there is evidence that parental choice of specific attention
regulation strategies may depend on the cultural background of the family. In a
study that examined interactions between caregivers and their 9- to 12-monthold children, Vigil (2002) found that mothers who had immigrated to Britain
from China preferred redirection strategies for establishing JA, while native-born
British caregivers relied predominantly on follow-in strategies, in line with what
has typically been found with other families with Western cultural backgrounds, as
reported earlier. It is important to note that Chinese-born parents' use of redirection
and UK-born parents' use of follow-in strategies were both associated with similar
vocabulary outcomes for their children. Despite different experiences with JA, both

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5

1226

groups of children had the same vocabulary size at 18 months of age, indicating
that use of redirections in this case was not detrimental to children's vocabulary
acquisition. In a similar vein, Vigil, Tyler, and Ross (2006) found that 15- to
21-month-old children in the United States whose parents had immigrated from
Mexico actually benefited from parents' use of redirection by learning more words
in a novel word learning task than when follow-in strategies were used. In contrast,
children of US-born parents learned more novel words when their parents used
a follow-in strategy. Clearly, each form of attention regulation was differentially
influential depending on the cultural background of the parents.
LEARNER CHARACTERISTICS

It has also been reported that the use of specific JA strategies is linked to learner
factors, including the developmental level or linguistic ability of the children.
More specifically, notwithstanding positive associations between use of follow-in
JA strategies with typically developing children, a redirection strategy is actually
preferred by parents whose children have special needs or language delays, particularly by mothers of deaf children or children with Down syndrome (Cheskin,
1982; Harris et al., 1996; Henggeler & Watson, 1984; Mahoney, Fors, & Wood,
1990; Marfo, 1991; for a review, see Paparella & Kasari, 2004). One explanation
for this is that redirections may be used to facilitate attentional engagement of
children who have difficulty focusing their attention on their own (e.g., Bell,
1979). Landry and Chapieski (1989) provided evidence for this claim by demonstrating that mothers of children with Down syndrome were more likely to redirect
their children's attention, not when it meant diverting their focus, but rather when
their children were not engaged in any other activity. In this way, these mothers
promoted interactions that may not have otherwise occurred.
Findings such as these highlight differences in interaction between mothers
and their children depending on the nature of each individual child's needs. This
appears to be the case not only for children with developmental disorders (for a
review, see Paparella & Kasari, 2004) but also for those with language difficulties as
well. For example, Conti-Ramsden (1990) examined the intelligibility of children
with specific language impairment and their mothers' use of recasts. Although
not usually considered a JA strategy, recasts allow caregivers to follow into their
child's attentional focus by repeating a child's utterance along with corrections,
providing a learning opportunity. In this sense, recasts may be considered a type of
follow-in strategy insofar as they are contingent on the child's behavior and do not
require an attentional switch. Conti-Ramsden found that the more adept children
were in their communication abilities, the more their mothers were able to use
recasts, ultimately promoting language development further. However, this pattern
was less likely to happen when children's language abilities were less developed.
In this case, children who were unable to provide sufficient linguistic input were
actually unable to elicit recasts from their mothers.
This finding is particularly relevant when considering the use of follow-ins for
children with linguistic delays. Very limited and inadequate output from children
may actually result in fewer opportunities for parents to support their children's
communicative efforts, resulting in lower linguistic gains. In the case of children

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5
Pierce et al.: Comparing mother father communication strategies

1227

with limited linguistic abilities, redirection strategies may actually be beneficial.
Parents may use redirections to elicit children's attention and engage them in interactions that promote language learning (Conti-Ramsden, 1994; Conti-Ramsden &
Friel-Patti, 1983). Lyon (1985) reported that mothers initiated conversations more
frequently with children who initiated conversations relatively less frequently.
Although this study did not examine JA, this finding is particularly important
to consider in the case of IA children. Upon adoption, IA children's language
abilities are necessarily lower than typically developing nonadopted children their
age because they have not yet been exposed to the adopted language, and thus,
redirections may actually provide the support they need to "catch-up" to their
peers. We return to this point later.
MOTHERS AND FATHERS

It might also be expected that there would be differences in mothers' and fathers'
JA patterns with their children. This has not been examined in parental language
use specifically during JA interactions; however, other aspects of language use have
been shown to differ between mothers and fathers (Conti-Ramsden, 1994). For
example, mothers have been shown to speak more to their children, take longer
conversational turns, and cover a greater number and variety of topics during
conversations with their children than do fathers. In contrast, fathers' conversations
with their children are typically shorter (Killarney & McCluskey, 1981), and
fathers have been shown to talk less with their children overall (Davidson & Snow,
1996). There is evidence that mothers interact with their children using strategies
that are considered to be more "child-centered" than fathers. Mothers tend to
use less directive forms of speech as well as language that is more supportive of
their children's vocabulary use (e.g., Dopke, 1992; Leaper et al., 1998). Moreover,
mothers adjust aspects of their language to match the linguistic abilities of their
children more than do fathers (e.g., Gleason, 1975). For example, Rondal (1980)
examined conversations between parents and their 18- to 36-month-old children
and showed that, even though both mothers and fathers simplified their language
when speaking to their children, fathers took fewer conversational turns than
mothers and made more requests for clarification. There is also evidence that
fathers use more directives and ask fewer questions when talking with their children
than do mothers (Andrews & Bernstein-Ratner, 1987; Malone & Guy, 1982).
However, there is also evidence that fathers' language use may be beneficial to
children's language learning in ways that differ from mothers. For example, fathers have been shown to use a greater number of different and uncommon words
than mothers (Masur & Gleason, 1980; Ratner, 1988), request more object labels
from their children (Masur & Gleason, 1980) and use more extensive vocabulary
when it is specifically relevant to a task (Brachfeld-Child, Simpson, & Izenson,
1988). Some theories suggest that this arguably more demanding use of language
functions to extend and broaden children's language (i.e., "bridge hypothesis";
Gleason, 1975). In support of this, Masur and Gleason (1980) found that when
fathers used relatively complex and demanding language with their children their
children responded with more varied vocabulary and higher mean length of utterances. Thus, evidence suggests that fathers provide children with a challenging

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5

1228

and rich verbal environment that may facilitate their language development over
time in a manner that differs from that of mothers.
Although mother-father differences have been observed, there is also evidence
that such differences may be mitigated in some contexts. More specifically, it
has been shown that mother-father differences in child-directed language use are
modulated by children's language-learning circumstances. Tucker, Hughes, and
Glover (1983) found that mothers and fathers of deaf children used very similar
strategies when interacting and talking with their children, and both parents adjusted their language level to that of their child equally. Goodz, Goodz, and Green
(1991) showed that when fathers in bilingual families were solely responsible for
teaching their native language to their children, they maintained conversations
longer and made similar language modifications as mothers. There is thus reason
to believe that mother-father differences might be diminished in certain atypical
language-learning situations, particularly when the need to aid or support children's language development is enhanced. This may be particularly relevant for
families with IA children, who may require extra support for their early language
acquisition.
IA CHILDREN

As noted earlier, the present study was undertaken to examine possible differences
between mothers and fathers in JA strategies with their biological children and
to examine the effect of learner-related factors on mother/father differences. In
order to examine learner-related factors, the present study examined the attentional
regulation strategies of adoptive parents of children from China in comparison to
those of birth parents. The findings on mothers of adopted children have been
reported previously; thus, the present results extend that study by including results
for adoptive and birth fathers (Gauthier, Genesee, Dubois, & Kasparian, 2011).
IA children are of particular interest for this purpose because they are in the
exceptional position of having to learn a second first language (Glennen, 2002)
from a young age when they are adopted into families whose language differs from
that of their birth families. Children from China are usually adopted prior to the
age of 24 months, as was the case of the children who participated in the present
study. As a result, the language-learning process is disrupted during a time when
JA abilities are typically established. This may affect the way in which IA children
engage in JA. At the time of adoption, IA children typically have limited mastery
of their birth language while lacking any knowledge of the adoption language.
Delayed exposure to the adoption language means that their skills in that language
do not line up with their cognitive abilities and, arguably, their communicative
needs. This initial inability to verbally communicate with their adoptive parents
may result in differences in interaction strategies in comparison to what is typically
observed for children of the same age and developmental level living with their
birth parents. There is some evidence that mothers interact with their IA children
in a manner that is similar to that found for mothers with younger children or
children with developmental delays (Gauthier et al., 2011)
In an in-depth examination of adoptive mothers' interactions with their IA
children, Gauthier and colleagues (2011) found that adoptive mothers played an

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5
Pierce et al.: Comparing mother father communication strategies

1229

active role in promoting and maintaining JA with their 15-month-old children and
that their children were not significantly delayed in engaging in JA in comparison
with nonadopted controls. They also found that the adoptive mothers' interactional strategies differed from those of the birth mothers. More specifically, the
adoptive mothers talked more than the birth mothers and used more repetitions.
This was likely to encourage JA with their children who were at a relatively
young level of linguistic ability relative to their chronological age. The adoptive
mothers were also more likely than birth mothers to redirect their child's attention
during episodes of JA, and use of this redirective strategy with their 15-month-old
children was positively correlated with their children's vocabulary development at
20 months of age. As discussed, this pattern has also been observed for mothers of
children with language delays and developmental disorders (e.g., Mahoney et al.,
1990).
The finding that mothers of IA children use more redirective strategies than
do mothers of nonadopted children suggests that these mothers are in tune with
their children's unique stage of language development and alter their behavior
in a way that seems to facilitate language learning. The question arises whether
adoptive fathers would differ from adoptive mothers in the same way that birth
mothers and fathers differ or whether adoptive fathers would actually resemble
mothers because of the additional linguistic support required by their children, as
was reported for bilingual families and those with atypical language learners.
THE PRESENT STUDY

The present study was designed to examine differences in JA strategies between
mothers and fathers. By examining the interaction strategies of both IA and birth
mothers and fathers we were also able to explore how mother-father differences
might interact with learner-specific factors to influence parents' attentional regulation strategies and, in turn, their child's language acquisition. One might expect
fewer differences between IA mothers and fathers than between birth mothers and
fathers because the former might be particularly sensitive to the unique languagelearning situation of their adopted children. Thus, the present study addressed (a)
whether mothers and fathers in general typically employ different JA strategies,
(b) whether adoptive parents employ different interaction strategies than birth
parents, and (c) whether there are differences between adoptive and birth mothers
and fathers with respect to general patterns of language use that might reflect
differences in adopted and nonadopted children's level of linguistic development.
Finally, we also examined whether and how any of adoptive and birth fathers'
language usage patterns were related to their children's language outcomes 5
months later.
Method
Participants. The participants included two groups of parents and their children:

8 IA children from China and their French-speaking mothers and fathers and
10 monolingual French-speaking nonadopted children and their French-speaking
biological mothers and fathers. The IA children and parents had participated in the

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5

1230

study by Gauthier and colleagues (2011); however, only data from mothers were
reported there. The children were all girls. The average age of the IA children
was 15.2 months (range = 14.9-15.7, SD = 0.29) at the time of the first session,
and 19.9 (range = 17.6-21.5, SD = 1.1) at the second session. The mean age
at adoption was 10.1 months (range = 9.0-11.5, SD = 0.79), and the average
length of exposure to French was 5.1 months (range = 3.9-6.0, SD = 0.76) at
the first session and 9.75 months (range = 7.6-11.5; SD = 1.3) at the second.
The mean age of the control children was 15.5 (range = 15.1-17.2, SD = 0.71)
at the first session and 20.27 (range = 19.1-21.9, SD = 0.70) at the second
session.
The children did not differ statistically for age, sex, or socioeconomic status
(SES). They did differ significantly on length of exposure to French, with IA
children having less exposure at both sessions (see Table 1). Controlling for SES is
important because it has been shown that families who adopt internationally tend to
be of relatively high SES (e.g., Tan & Yang, 2005), and SES is positively correlated
with language development (e.g., Arriaga, Fenson, Cronan, & Pethick, 1998;
Hoff, 2006). Detailed demographic information of the participants is presented in
Table 1.
Procedures. The study took place over two sessions, roughly 5 months apart, in

the participants' homes to ensure that the children were at ease. During the first
session, the procedure and objectives of the study were explained to the parents,
and their informed consent was obtained. One of the parents was then asked
to complete a developmental questionnaire that included information about (a)
the child's health and development and their medical condition, before and after
adoption (for the IA children); (b) the parents' education and income; and (c) the
language environment of the home. This information was used to document the
children's past exposure to French, English, and other languages. The mothers
and fathers were then separately asked to interact with their children as they
typically would using toys that they would normally use during play sessions.
These sessions lasted for 30 min per parent and were video recorded for later
transcription, coding, and analysis.
During the second session, both questionnaires were updated, and children's
vocabulary was assessed using the French version of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI; Fenson et al., 2007).1 Parents completed the
Mots et Gestes form at 15 months (words and gestures; Trudeau, Frank, & PoulinDubois, 1997) and the Mots et Enonces form at 20 months (words and sentences;
Frank, Poulin-Dubois, & Trudeau, 1997). At 15 months, the dependent variables
extracted from the MCDI were the number of words understood and produced
and communicative and symbolic gestures they tried or completed. At 20 months,
expressive language ability was determined by parental reports of the number of
words their children produced and whether or not they were combining words
(yes/no response).
The taped sessions at 15 months were transcribed and
coded according to the CHAT format (MacWhinney & Snow, 1990). Only the
20 min of each recording session following the first 5 min were analyzed; the first

5 min were not analyzed to ensure the parent and child were comfortable with
the procedure and were not attending to the examiner or video camera. Caregiver
utterances were coded for JA episodes according to Tomasello and Todd's (1983)
guidelines (identical to those used in Gauthier et al., 2011): (a) A JA episode
begins with one person initiating interaction with the other, and episodes were
coded as being initiated by the child or the parent; (b) both participants must
visually focus on a single object or activity for at least 3 s (though they can
look away shortly during long interactions); and (c) to show that the child is
aware of the interaction taking place, the child must, at some point during the
interaction, direct some behavior toward the caregiver (e.g., looking at his face).
Episodes between JA were coded as non-JA episodes. Percentage of JA episodes
was calculated as the number of JA episodes divided by the total number of
episodes in the transcript. Percentage of child-initiated JA episodes was calculated
as the number of JA episodes initiated by the child divided by the total number
of JA episodes initiated by parents and children combined in the transcript. The
length of each JA episode was measured in seconds. Inside JA episodes, parents'
utterances were coded as (a) following-in, that is, the parent attended to an object or activity already being attended to by the child; (b) successful redirection,
the parent successfully directed the child's attention to an object or activity that
they were not already attending to; and (c) unsuccessful redirection, a failed
attempt by the parent to direct the child's attention to a new object or activity.
Percentages for use of each attention regulation strategy were calculated as the
number of utterances employing a particular strategy (i.e., successful or unsuccessful redirection, or follow-in) divided by the total number of utterances within
JA.
Twenty percent of the transcripts were recoded entirely by a second coder in
order to assess coding reliability. The percentage of agreement was between 90.4%

Children's language outcomes at 15 and 20 months. Table 2 summarizes the

results from the MCDI at 15 and 20 months. There were no significant differences
between the IA and nonadopted children with respect to number of words produced
(Mann-Whitney U = 36.00, z = -0.36, p = .72) or understood (Mann-Whitney
U = 34.00, z = -0.53, p = .63) at 15 months. The children in both groups were
similar in the number of communicative gestures they tried and/or completed
(Mann-Whitney U = 38.00, z = -0.86, p = .90). However, there was a moderately
significant difference between the two groups with respect to the number of words
their parents reported that they produced at 20 months (Mann-Whitney U = 18.00,
z = -1.96, p = .05). Chi-square tests indicated that there were significantly fewer
IA children combining words at 20 months compared to the nonadopted children
(2 = 4.10, p = .04). In general, the language abilities of the IA children were very
similar to those of the nonadopted children even though the IA children began to
acquire French later than the nonadopted children. This supports previous findings
that IA children adopted from China at young ages make rapid initial progress
in learning their new language following adoption (e.g., Geren, Snedeker, & Ax,
2005; Glennen, 2005; Pollock, Price, & Fulmer, 2003; Tan & Yang, 2005).

Mothers' and fathers' general language use. In order to examine the nature of

the parents' general language use with their children, we examined the number
of parents' utterances within and outside episodes of JA, as well as in total. We
also examined parent type/token ratios in order to get a measure of the variety of
words that parents used with their children. These indices of parent language use
were compared across mothers and fathers using repeated measures analyses of
variance with parent (mother or father) as a within-subjects factor and birth status
(adopted or birth) as a between-subjects factor. Partial eta squared (2p ) is reported
as a measure of effect size for all comparisons. A value greater than 0.2 indicates a
meaningful effect for significant differences. Results for each individual group are
observed in Table 3, results for mothers and fathers collapsed across birth status,
and adopted and birth families collapsed across parents are in Table 4.
For total number of utterances (within and outside of JA combined), there was
a trend for mothers to produce more utterances than fathers, F (1, 16) = 4.09, p
= .060, 2p = 0.20, and there was a main effect of birth status, F (1, 16) = 15.33,
p = .001, 2p = 0.49, with adoptive parents using more utterances with their
children than birth parents. The ParentxBirth Status interaction was not significant
F (1, 16) = 1.98, p = .179, 2p = 0.11. For number of utterances inside JA, there was
no main effect of parent, F (1, 16) = 3.44, p = .082, 2p = 0.18; however, there was
a main effect of birth status, F (1, 16) = 4.55, p = .049, 2p = 0.22, indicating that
adoptive parents used more utterances within JA episodes than did birth parents.
The interaction was not significant, F (1, 16) = 0.040, p = .844, 2p = 0.11,
2p = 0.00. A different pattern was observed for number of utterances outside of
JA, with no main effect for either parent, F (1, 16) = 0.391, p = .541, 2p = 0.02, or
birth status, F (1, 16) = 2.68, p = .121, 2p = 0.14, but a significant ParentxBirth

Status interaction, F (1, 16) = 7.56, p = .014, 2p = 0.32. Post hoc comparisons
revealed that this was due to adoptive mothers using more utterances than birth
mothers (p < 0.01). The difference between adoptive and birth fathers was not
significant, nor was the difference between parents in each group. Finally, when
examining type/token ratios, there was a significant main effect of parent, F (1,
16) = 12.68, p = .003, 2p = 0.44, with fathers producing a higher type/token
ratio than mothers. There was no main effect of birth status, F (1, 16) = 0.008,
p = .928, 2p = 0.00, and the interaction was not significant, F (1, 16) = 0.529,
p = .478, 2p = 0.03.
Overall, these results indicate certain mother-father differences (see Table 4) in
that mothers in both groups tended to talk more to their children than did fathers,
both inside JA and in total. At the same time, the type/token ratio of fathers in both
groups was higher than that of mothers so that fathers were potentially providing
more varied vocabulary for their children than were mothers. Outside of JA, IA
mothers in particular used more utterances than nonadoptive mothers (see Table 3).
This may indicate a general increase in use of language by IA mothers in particular
in order to support their children's language acquisition.
Time in JA. In order to examine the extent and nature of parent-child JA interactions in detail, several behaviors were examined: number of JA episodes, percent
of JA episodes (number of JA episodes divided by total number of episodes in the
transcripts), total time (s) spent in JA, mean length of JA episodes (seconds spent in
JA divided by number of JA episodes), number of child-initiated JA episodes, and
percentage of child-initiated JA episodes (number of child-initiated JA episodes
divided by number of JA episodes). For these variables, we examined both number
and percent as there is evidence that sheer volume of input plays a role in language
development (e.g., Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer, & Lyon, 1991); we also
included percentages in order to control for differences in the volume of language
used. Results for each individual group are observed in Table 3, results for mothers
and fathers collapsed across birth status and adopted and birth families collapsed
across parents are in Table 4.
For number of JA episodes, there was a significant main effect of parent, F (1,
16) = 10.65, p = .005, 2p = 0.40, with mothers engaging in a greater number
of episodes than fathers, but there was no main effect of birth status, F (1, 16)
= 0.748, p = .400, 2p = 0.05, and the interaction was not significant, F (1, 16)
= 1.04, p = .322, 2p = 0.06. For percent of JA episodes, however, there was no
main effect of parent, F (1, 16) = 0.840, p = .373, 2p = 0.05, or birth status, F (1,
16) = 0.175, p = .681, 2p = 0.01, but the interaction was significant, F (1, 16) =
4.85, p = .043, 2p = 0.23. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the birth mothers
engaged in a higher percentage of JA episodes than birth fathers (p < 0.05),
but IA mothers and fathers did not differ significantly. It is interesting that IA
fathers actually engaged in a numerically higher percentage of JA episodes than
IA mothers. Although this difference was not statistically significant, it contrasts
with the pattern observed for birth mothers and fathers.
With respect to total length of time (s) spent in JA, there was no main effect of
parent, F (1, 16) = 0.431, p = .521, 2p = 0.03, or birth status, F (1, 16) = 0.010,

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5

p = .922. 2p = 0.00, but there was a significant ParentxBirth Status interaction,
F (1, 16) = 5.50, p = .032, 2p = 0.26. Post hoc comparisons revealed that birth
mothers spent more time engaged in JA than did the birth fathers (p < 0.05), but
this difference was not significant for adoptive mothers and fathers. In terms of
mean length of JA episodes, neither main effect, parent: F (1, 16) = 2.85, p =
.111, 2p = 0.15; birth status: F (1, 16) = 0.065, p = .803, 2p = 0.00, nor the
interaction, F (1, 16) = 0.646, p = .433, 2p = 0.04, was significant.
For number of child-initiated JA episodes, there was a main effect of parent,
F (1, 16) = 6.28, p = .023, 2p = 0.28, with children initiating more JA episodes
with mothers than with fathers, but there was no main effect of birth status, F
(1, 16) = 0.270, p = .610, 2p = 0.02, and the interaction was not significant,
F (1, 16) = 0.452, p = .511, 2p = 0.03. However, in terms of percentage of
child-initiated JA episodes, there was no main effect of either parent, F (1, 16) =
2.54, p = .137, 2p = 0.13, or birth status, F (1, 16) = 0.311, p = .585, 2p = 0.02,
and the interaction was not significant, F (1, 16) = 0.596, p = .451, 2p = 0.04.
Overall, these results indicate certain differences in mothers' and fathers' engagement in JA. Mothers engaged in a greater number of JA episodes with their
children than did fathers (see Table 4), and children also initiated JA more often
with mothers than with fathers. It appears that at least some of the differences
between mothers and fathers were driven by differences between birth mothers
and fathers in particular (see Table 3). Birth mothers spent a greater percentage
of time engaged in JA than did birth fathers, and each JA episode was longer for
birth mothers than for birth fathers. In contrast, IA mothers and fathers spent an
equal amount of time within each JA episode, and IA fathers actually engaged
in a higher percentage of JA episodes than IA mothers, although this difference
was not statistically significant. This indicates that IA fathers in particular may
have altered their behavior to support their children's unique language-learning
circumstances.
In order to investigate specific strategies used by parents within JA interactions, we examined parents' use
of both successful and unsuccessful redirections, as well as follow-ins. Results
for each individual group are observed in Table 3, results for mothers and fathers
collapsed across birth status, and adopted and birth families collapsed across
parents are in Table 4.
In terms of percentage of successful redirections, there was no main effect of
parent, F (1, 16) = 0.68, p = .422, 2p = 0.12, or birth status, F (1, 16) = 0.394,
p = .539, 2p = 0.02, and the interaction was not significant, F (1, 16) = 0.022,
p = .884, 2p = 0.05. For percentage of unsuccessful redirections, there was no
main effect of parent, F (1, 16) = 0.094, p = .763, 2p = 0.01, or birth status, F (1,
16) = 0.889, p = .360, 2p = 0.05, and the interaction was not significant, F (1, 16)
= 0.624, p = .441, 2p = 0.04. With respect to percentage of follow-ins, there was
no main effect of parent, F (1, 16) = 0.686, p = .420, 2p = 0.04, or birth status,
F (1, 16) = 0.352, p = .561, 2p = 0.02, and the interaction was not significant, F
(1, 16) = 0.029, p = .867, 2p = 0.00.

In terms of actual frequencies of each type of attention regulation strategy, for
number of successful redirections there was no main effect of parent, F (1, 16) =
2.21, p = .157, 2p = 0.12, but there was a main effect of birth status, F (1, 16)
= 4.71, p = .045, 2p = 0.23, with IA parents engaging in a greater number of
successful redirections than birth parents; the interaction was not significant, F (1,
16) = 0.001, p = .978, 2p = 0.00. For number of unsuccessful redirections, there
was no main effect of parent, F (1, 16) = 1.33, p = .266, 2p = 0.08, or birth status,
F (1, 16) = 0.456, p = .509, 2p = 0.03, and the interaction was not significant, F
(1, 16) = 0.064, p = .804, 2p = 0.00. Similarly, for number of follow-in utterances,
there was no main effect of either parent, F (1, 16) = 0.004, p = .948, 2p = 0.00,
or birth status, F (1, 16) = 0.000, p = .996, 2p = 0.00, and the interaction was not
significant, F (1, 16) = 0.102, p = .754, 2p = 0.00.
Overall, these results indicate mother-father differences in the use of specific interaction strategies within JA as mothers were better at redirecting their children's
attention than fathers. This was similar to the differences observed between IA and
birth parents (see Table 4), except that IA parents used an even greater number of
redirections than birth parents and more of these were successful. Thus, it appears
that IA parents, including fathers, were more likely to rely on redirective strategies, perhaps as a means to support their children's early language acquisition. In
general, however, mothers were more successful in this regard than fathers.
Relationship between JA strategies at 15 months and child outcomes at 20 months.

In order to examine the relationships between fathers' attention regulation strategies and general language use at 15 months versus the IA children's vocabulary development at 20 months, Spearman correlations were calculated. Only the fathers'
results are reported here because these correlations were reported for mothers by
Gauthier and colleagues (2011). Gauthier and colleagues had previously shown
that the number of redirective utterances used by IA mothers when their children
were 15 months was significantly and positively correlated with their children's
expressive vocabulary scores on the MCDI at 20 months, r (10) = .57, p < 0.01.
Following Gauthier and colleagues, correlations were calculated between adoptive and nonadoptive fathers' language and attention regulation strategy use at 15
months (number of total utterances, number of follow-in utterances, number of
total redirections, and ratio produced by father) and children's language outcomes
(the number of words understood and produced by the children at 15 months and
the number of words produced by the children at 20 months according to the
MCDI).
No significant correlations occurred between adoptive or birth fathers' language
and attention regulation strategies at 15 months and their children's language
outcomes (see Tables 5 and 6).
DISCUSSION

The present study sought to examine how language use with children and,
in particular during episodes of JA, might differ in mothers and fathers and
with children with different learner characteristics (IA vs. birth children). We

examined whether (a) fathers employ different interaction strategies than mothers;
(b) adoptive parents employ different interaction strategies than birth parents; (c)
there are differences between mothers and fathers in adoptive families in comparison to the parents in birth families, potentially because of differences in children's
level of linguistic development; and (d) any of these differences relate to children's
language outcomes. Each of these questions is discussed in turn.

Mothers Versus Fathers

A key comparison in the present study was between mothers and fathers, regardless
of the birth status of the child. The question addressed in these comparisons was
how fathers engage linguistically with their children, especially with respect to JA,
and how their interaction styles are the same or different from those of mothers. Our
results indicate that mothers and fathers were similar in a number of respects. They
spent a similar amount of time engaged in JA, both in total and per JA episode, and
their use of redirections and follow-ins during episodes of JA, measured as total
amount of actual time and percentage time, was similar. At the same time, some
noteworthy differences were observed. Mothers tended to use more utterances than
fathers, both inside JA as well as in total, although these differences were only
marginally significant. Mothers also engaged in a greater number of JA episodes
with their children than did fathers, and the children themselves initiated JA more
often with their mothers than with their fathers. These findings are consistent with
previous research, which has shown that mothers talk more with their children and
are more likely than fathers to engage their children in JA, a strategy that some
have argued is favorable for language learning (Cherry & Lewis 1976; Leaper
et al., 1998; Stoneman & Brody 1981).
In contrast, the fathers in the present study, as a group, had a higher type/token
ratio when speaking with their children, although mothers spoke more. These
findings are consistent with previous research (Ratner, 1988) and suggest that
fathers are less child centered and provide their children with a more complex
source of vocabulary and possibly, as a result, more cognitively challenging activities (Kornhaber & Marcos, 2000). That mothers had relatively low type/token
ratios implies that they used a more restricted range of words and more lexical
repetitions than did fathers. This is consistent with previous research showing that
mothers tend to adjust their vocabulary and sentence length to match that of their
children (e.g., Dopke, 1992; Leaper, et al., 1998). In contrast, fathers' use of more
varied vocabulary with their children may be beneficial in a different way as it
provides children with cognitive challenges and, more specifically, may prepare
them for interactions outside the home (e.g., Tomasello & Barton, 1994; Gleason,
1975; Tenenbaum & Leaper, 1998).
Thus, although there are similarities in the ways mothers and fathers in general
interacted with their children, noteworthy differences emerged, leading to the
conclusion that parents provide different linguistic environments for their children
in some respects from an early age. Because of the crucial role that JA is thought to
play in early language acquisition, as well as the fact that the majority of children
learn language from fathers as well as mothers, these comparisons are important
but often unexplored.
Adoptive Versus Birth Parents

Another important set of comparisons addressed was between adoptive and birth
parents. Here the question was whether adoptive and birth parents use language
in the same ways with their children. By examining similarities and differences
in these parent groups, we were able to investigate how learner-specific factors

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5
Pierce et al.: Comparing mother father communication strategies

1241

might influence parent-child interactions, particularly JA. Our results provide
evidence that both adoptive mothers and fathers are child centered and actively
engaged in the language development of their children, arguably in an effort
to help their IA children "catch-up" in their newly adopted language. This is
consistent with the child-centered behavior of mothers in general and with patterns
typically observed for mothers in comparison to fathers (Cherry & Lewis 1976;
Leaper et al., 1998; Stoneman & Brody 1981). More specifically, adoptive parents
considered as a group used a greater number of redirections, and specifically
successful redirections, than did birth parents. As discussed earlier, redirections
are typically used to a greater extent with younger children and with children
with special needs or developmental delays (e.g., Mahoney et al., 1990). Although
these IA children did not differ significantly from the nonadopted children in
terms of language development at the time of testing and therefore would not be
considered clinically delayed, perhaps their delayed exposure to French motivated
the adoptive parents to talk with them as they would younger children in order
to facilitate their acquisition of the adopted language. It is possible that it was
use of this strategy that explains why the IA children scored as well as the birth
children at the time of the first testing, shortly after their adoption. Gauthier and
her colleagues found that the adoptive mothers used significantly more utterances
than birth mothers in and even outside of JA. More language input is typically
associated with greater vocabulary development (e.g., Huttenlocher et al., 1991),
and adoptive mothers' use of redirections in particular has been associated with
vocabulary size in adopted children (Gauthier et al., 2011). Thus, it appears that
adoptive parents may be responding to the specific needs of their children, or at
least what they perceive to be needs, for extended or enriched input in order to
catch up to their nonadopted peers.
Adoptive Mothers and Fathers in Comparison to Birth Mothers and Fathers

Notwithstanding differences in language use that have been found to characterize
mothers and fathers in general, as discussed earlier, research also suggests that
mothers and fathers tend to use language more similarly under certain conditions
and, in particular, that fathers adopt more active and child-centered patterns of
language use with their children under certain circumstances. This has been found
in cases where children require additional support for language acquisition because
of disorders or delays (e.g., Tucker et al., 1983) or in bilingual families where the
father is the sole source of input for his language (Goodz et al., 1991). Results from
the present study indicate that not only did the adoptive parents as a group tend to
use the active, child-centered patterns that are typical of mothers in general, but
that adoptive fathers in particular were more likely than birth fathers to use such
strategies, resulting in adoptive fathers and mothers being more similar than birth
fathers and mothers (see Table 3). For example, while birth fathers spent less total
time in JA (666.1 s on average) than birth mothers (832.5 s on average) and engaged
in a lower percentage of JA episodes (birth fathers = 50.51%, birth mothers =
53.37%), these differences were not significant in the case of adoptive fathers and
mothers. Rather, adoptive mothers and fathers spent the same total time in JA
(adoptive mothers: 694.75 s on average; adoptive fathers: 788.38 s on average)

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5
Pierce et al.: Comparing mother father communication strategies

1242

as birth mothers and, overall, more than was observed for birth fathers. Adoptive
fathers actually spent more time on average in JA than adoptive mothers, and they
had a higher percentage of JA episodes (53.05% on average) than adoptive mothers
(51.87% on average), although these differences were not statistically significant.
It is arguable that large within-group variance accounts for the lack of significance
in these results.
Examination of numerical differences between adoptive and birth fathers indicates that the adoptive fathers scored higher than birth fathers on a number of
measures, indicating more active and child-centered language use (see Table 3).
For example, adoptive fathers used a greater number of total utterances, as well
as utterances within JA, than either birth mothers or fathers; they engaged in
both a greater number and percentage of JA episodes than birth fathers; they
spent a longer total amount of time in JA than birth fathers; and they had longer
JA episodes, on average, than both birth mothers and fathers. They also had a
greater number and percentage of successful redirections and fewer unsuccessful
redirections than birth mothers and fathers. Admittedly these differences were not
statistically significant, although some of these differences might be statistically
significant with larger sample sizes. Arguably, the adoptive fathers were motivated
to use language with their children in these ways in order to promote their language
development so that they can catch-up with age-expected norms.

JA and Language Outcomes

The final question addressed in the present study concerned the relationship between fathers' use of language and their children's later vocabulary development.
We found that none of the indices of language use for the adoptive or birth fathers,
including the types of attention regulation strategies they used, were significantly
correlated with their children's expressive vocabulary at 20 months. This contrasts
with the results reported by Gauthier and colleagues (2011), who found that
adoptive mothers' use of redirecting strategies at 15 months was significantly
and positively correlated with the number of words produced by their children at
20 months. That this was not the case for the adoptive fathers is particularly interesting because both adoptive parents favored use of redirections during episodes
of JA. The differential relationship between adoptive mothers' and fathers' use
of redirections and their children's subsequent vocabulary development may be
partially attributable to differences in the nature of the mother/father-child relationship and partly to differences in the amount of time each parent spends with his
or her children; more specifically, fathers may spend insufficient time with their
children to make a significant difference in this respect. An interesting follow-up
would be to examine the amount of time parents spend with their children and in
what capacities to determine whether this changes the nature and effect of fathers'
input. Another possible explanation for these results is that the complexity of
the fathers' language posed a linguistic challenge that made it difficult for their
children to learn from them. It could also be that fathers' language use is associated with aspects of children's language development that are not assessed by
the MCDI. For example, no measures of grammatical complexity were examined

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:5
Pierce et al.: Comparing mother father communication strategies

1243

here. Rondal (1980) found that this aspect of language was associated specifically
with fathers' language use.
Limitations and conclusions

There are limitations to this study. The sample size is small and limits the generalizability of the findings and may have limited the statistical findings. The study
is also limited to the specific indices of child language development it examined
and in the time over which effects were examined. Our results are also limited to
observations of parents who have adopted children from China who were adopted
between 12 and 24 months of age; it is possible that longer delays before adoption
may affect how parents interact with adoptive children and, in particular, how they
engage them in JA.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings from the present study corroborate previous studies, which have shown that the language parents use to address
their children and, specifically, the way in which parents engage children in JA,
may be shaped in significant ways by children's specific language-learning needs
or characteristics. The present study corroborates these previous findings by showing that not only adoptive mothers but also adoptive fathers tailor aspects of their
language use with their children in accordance with their unique language-learning
situation. The present results with respect to fathers also argue, by extrapolation,
that fathers in general, like mothers in general, alter their linguistic interactions
with their children in cases where their children are delayed or require additional
support, or are perceived to require additional support. Of particular note, the
results from this study suggest that mothers and fathers may adopt similar patterns
of language use, patterns that resemble those of mothers, in circumstances where
children need or are perceived to need more support in language learning. At the
same time, the present study raises the broader questions of how much fathers
influence their children's language development and under what circumstances.
There has been a general lack of attention to fathers' language. The present results
call for more research in this domain and, in particular, research on fathers of
children with atypical or special language-learning needs or backgrounds in contrast to fathers of children who are learning language under typical circumstances.
The results from such studies would have both interesting theoretical and practical
implications.
