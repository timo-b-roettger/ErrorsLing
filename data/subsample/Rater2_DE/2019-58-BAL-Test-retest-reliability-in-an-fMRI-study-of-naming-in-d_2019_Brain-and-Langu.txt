fMRI has been used as an outcome measure in dementia treatment studies, with many previous studies comparing only single pre- and post-treatment fMRI scans to determine treatment-induced neural changes, while
utilizing single subject experimental designs. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate fMRI test-retest
reliability in dementia patients and typical older adults using noun and verb confrontation naming to evaluate
the validity of using a single pre/post-treatment scan comparison. Seven individuals with dementia and 9 control
participants were tested three times over two months using the same fMRI procedures. Differences in individual
and group level activation patterns were observed that varied across time. Additionally, the extent of variability
fluctuated across individuals, groups, and the grammatical category of target words. Our findings suggested that
one time fMRI scanning may inadequately represent an individual's typical brain activation pattern, particularly
an individual with dementia. Thus, multiple imaging baselines are recommended.

1. Introduction
Word retrieval problems are prominent and pervasive even in the
early stages of dementia (Alzheimer's Association, 2017; Cappa et al.,
1998; Jokel, Graham, Rochon, & Leonard, 2014; Murray & Clark,
2015). Naming difficulties are found not only in individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but also other types of dementing diseases such
as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD; Antonucci & Reilly, 2008;
Cappa et al., 1998; Hodges, Patterson, Oxbury, & Funnell, 1992), and
vascular dementia (VD; Bentham, Jones, & Hodges, 1997; Graham,
Emery, & Hodges, 2004). Accumulating evidence suggests individuals
with dementia demonstrate positive responses to behavioral naming
treatments despite the progressive nature of dementing diseases
(Beeson et al., 2011; Dressel et al., 2010; Henry et al., 2013; Jokel et al.,
2014, 2016; Meyer, Snider, Eckmann, & Friedman, 2015; Reilly, 2016).
Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that generalization and
maintenance of cognitive and linguistic gains are possible in dementia
(Beeson et al., 2011; Croot et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2013; Jokel et al.,
2014; Paek, Murray, & Newman, 2015).
Despite the improved naming performance that has been reported
when individuals with dementia are provided language treatment, relatively little is known about what neurophysiological mechanisms
support or are a product of these positive changes. To delineate the

underlying neural substrate, researchers have begun to utilize fMRI
techniques as a dependent measure for treatment outcomes, thus far
finding all participants with dementia have demonstrated treatmentinduced changes in their neural activation patterns (Beeson et al., 2011;
Dressel et al., 2010; Jokel et al., 2016; Marcotte & Ansaldo, 2010; Paek
et al., 2015). Single subject designs (SSD) have been commonly used to
assess language treatment effects in neurogenic populations including
dementia (Byiers, Reichle, & Symons, 2012; Howard, Best, & Nickels,
2015; Tate et al., 2008). In this design, investigators closely observe
participants' performance over time, and report improvements based on
the comparison between post-treatment performance and baseline
performance, which is repeatedly observed at least three times before
treatment to establish internal validity and to rule out potential extraneous confounds such as intra-individual variability (Thompson, 2015).
However, fMRI studies of treatment effects rarely collect more than one
pre- or post-treatment scan when using SSD in studies of dementia or
aphasia. Given that SSDs are often advocated as the preferred research
design, the mere comparison of pre- versus post-treatment imaging
results, each of which is collected only once, gives rise to a fundamental
question about whether these neuroimaging results truly represent the
participant's brain activation patterns at each time point and whether
any changes can be attributed to treatment.
For reliable fMRI results, any possible errors that arise from

for LH hippocampus).
Nonetheless, there remain several gaps in the literature regarding
fMRI reliability in dementia. First, language paradigms have not yet
been used; instead, most investigations have focused on memory
functions (e.g., encoding and retrieval; Atri et al., 2011; Clement &
Belleville, 2009; Putcha et al., 2011; Zanto et al., 2014). Furthermore,
regions of interest investigated in prior reliability studies for MCI or
dementia focused on areas associated with memory symptoms and
abilities, such as the hippocampus (Atri et al., 2011; Putcha et al., 2011;
Wagner et al., 2005; Zanto et al., 2014). Therefore, the current literature yields no information about the reliability of language-related
brain areas. Accordingly, further documentation of the reliability of
fMRI for individuals with dementia, particularly when language scanning tasks are used, is needed to monitor treatment-induced longitudinal changes or declines associated with disease progress.
Other shortcomings of the current fMRI reliability studies involving
language paradigms include that some studies did not report in-scanner
behavioral performance (e.g., Brandt et al., 2013; Caceres et al., 2009;
Harrington et al., 2006; Mahowald & Fedorenko, 2016; Rau et al., 2007;
Rutten et al., 2002; Specht, Willmes, Shah, & Jancke, 2003), or utilized
covert tasks (e.g., Harrington et al., 2006), which hinder observation of
behavioral performance directly related to the neural activation. In
turn, it becomes difficult to evaluate whether any observed activation
changes were associated with behavioral changes. Additionally, none of
the language tasks previously investigated for test-retest reliability required overt speech, except for the task used by Rau et al. (2007). In
contrast, anomia treatment fMRI studies often employ overt speech
tasks to monitor participants' in-scanner task performance (e.g., Beeson
et al., 2011; Marcotte & Ansaldo, 2010; Paek et al., 2015). Therefore,
further investigation of test-retest reliability is warranted to determine
the reliability of such fMRI language measures in the dementia population.
The current study evaluated fMRI test-retest reliability among individuals with dementia utilizing language (i.e., word retrieval) tasks.
To obtain brain activation patterns while naming, participants were
asked to name pictures over three time points in a 3T MRI machine. In
the absence of cognitive or language treatment, we examined whether
the brain activation patterns and word retrieval scores in each individual remain unchanged across repeated measures. The research
questions were as follows:

collecting data from two or more different time points should be ruled
out as well as intra-person variability across scanning sessions (Bennett
& Miller, 2010). For example, head motion, task performance, physiological noise (e.g., influence of caffeine, number of hours of sleep), and
the cognitive strategy of a participant might change from one to another scanning session (Chen & Small, 2007; Fournier, Chase, Almeida,
& Phillips, 2014; Gonzalez-Castillo & Talavage, 2011; Kurland et al.,
2004). fMRI reliability also depends on environmental or physiological
fluctuations and the inter-scan interval (Bennett & Miller, 2013; Liou
et al., 2003). Therefore, the underlying assumption that repeating fMRI
measures yields reliable results needs to be documented, to validate the
practice of a single pre- versus post-treatment scan comparison commonly adopted in prior language intervention studies in dementia patients. Thus far, however, SSD research of dementia treatment has not
considered this variability.
One time baseline scanning can be problematic especially for dementia research given that dementia is most frequently caused by
progressive, not static, disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2017). As individuals with dementia experience the neurodegenerative process,
which includes atrophy and other neuropathology over time (Brambati
et al., 2015; Rogalski et al., 2011; Staffaroni et al., 2017; Whitwell
et al., 2015), it is possible that they would show dissimilar brain activation patterns at two different points, even without intervention. For
instance, a longitudinal study investigated functional brain changes in
four logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) participants
over the course of 1 year, repeating fMRI measures every 6 months in
the absence of any intervention (Heim et al., 2014). The participants
performed a visual lexical decision task in the scanner. The researchers
used a flexible factorial design for repeated measures with the obtained
activation statistics and found increased activation amplitude in left
hemisphere (LH) posterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG), superior
frontal gyrus (SFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), superior parietal
lobe (SPL), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and right hemisphere (RH)
precuneus; despite such activation changes, the participants' behavioral
lexical decision performances remained unchanged over time due to
ceiling effects. Given this increased brain activation observed without
any intervention or changes on the behavioral task, the interpretation
of treatment-induced neural changes becomes more complicated.
Nevertheless, no previous dementia treatment study has included a
control participant who is going through the same neurodegenerative
disease and scanned at different time points.
Current literature regarding test-retest fMRI reliability for cognitive
and language paradigms with varying populations suggests that the
reliability depends on, at least in part, the nature of the fMRI paradigm,
participant characteristics (e.g., age, presence of disease, disease
etiology and severity), inter-scan interval, and region of interest (Aron,
Gluck, & Poldrack, 2006; Atri et al., 2011; Brandt et al., 2013; Caceres,
Hall, Zelaya, Williams, & Mehta, 2009; Chen & Small, 2007; Clement &
Belleville, 2009; Fournier et al., 2014; Gonzalez-Castillo & Talavage,
2011; Harrington, Buonocore, & Farias, 2006; Kurland et al., 2004;
Mahowald & Fedorenko, 2016; Putcha et al., 2011; Rau et al., 2007;
Rutten, Ramsey, Van Rijen, & Van Veelen, 2002; Wagner et al., 2005;
Wei et al., 2004; Zanto, Pa, & Gazzaley, 2014). In general, findings from
studies with participants with mild AD or mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) utilizing memory tasks in the scanner have provided support for
using fMRI to investigate the efficacy of therapeutic agents for memory
or cognitive decline at the group level (Atri et al., 2011; Clement &
Belleville, 2009; Putcha et al., 2011; Zanto et al., 2014). For example,
Atri et al. (2011) examined fMRI reliability in 12 participants with mild
AD (Mini Mental State Exam score 16-26). Participants were scanned
during baseline, 6-week, and 12-week follow-up sessions while enrolled
in a placebo-arm of a pharmacological treatment study. Face-name
encoding tasks were used in the scanner, and the reliability was determined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in bilateral hippocampal regions. Results indicated moderate to substantial reliability
of fMRI measures (i.e., ICC 0.59-0.87 for RH hippocampus, 0.67-0.74

(a) In the absence of intervention, will the fMRI measured activation
remain statistically unchanged across repeated fMRI measures in
individuals with dementia?
(b) In the absence of intervention, will the word retrieval task scores
remain statistically unchanged across repeated measures in individuals with dementia?
(c) Does the magnitude of reliability differ between individuals with
dementia and age- and education-matched typical-aging adults?
For research questions (a) and (b), we hypothesized that brain activation patterns and word retrieval scores would demonstrate modest
changes across sessions given the cognitive and linguistic deterioration
that individuals with dementia exhibit over time, particularly in the
absence of cognitive-linguistic intervention (Blair, Marczinski, DavisFaroque, & Kertesz, 2007; Kemper, Thompson, & Marquis, 2001;
Maguire, Kumaran, Hassabis, & Kopelman, 2010). With respect to research question c), we hypothesized that the degree of reliability would
differ between groups as prior research has documented different
magnitudes of reliability across different groups (Fournier et al., 2014;
Putcha et al., 2011). Compared to typical-aging adults, individuals with
dementia show greater declines in the cognitive components required
for word retrieval processes (Belleville, Chertkow, & Gauthier, 2007;
Kensinger, Shearer, Locascio, Growdon, & Corkin, 2003; Stopford,
Thompson, Neary, Richardson, & Snowden, 2012), and thus may show
less stable performance and activation patterns across different time

verbal and non-verbal memory skills, the Test of Memory and Learning -
Senior Edition (TOMAL-SE; Reynolds & Voress, 2012) was administered.
To test visual and verbal short-term and working memory abilities, the
Visual Memory and Digit Span subtests (forward and backward), respectively, from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R; Wechsler,
1987) were given. Executive function measures included the Comprehensive Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-2 (CTONI-2; Hammill, Pearson, &
Weiderholt, 2009) to determine nonverbal reasoning and problem solving skills and the Calibrated Ideational Fluency Assessment (CIFA;
Schretlen & Vannorsdall, 2010), a nonverbal analogue of verbal fluency
tasks, to assess ideational fluency, the ability to rapidly generate or
retrieve ideas (Vannorsdall, Maroof, Gordon, & Schretlen, 2012). This
test battery was given to both groups before the first and third fMRI
scans, which were separated by a two-month interval. Additionally,
family members currently living with the participants with dementia
completed the Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS; Clark & Ewbank,
1996) to document dementia participants' functional impairments. All
tests were administered within one session that lasted about 2.5 h. The
order of tests was randomized within and across participants. All participants completed all tests, and all test scores were calculated based
on each test's scoring manual.

points.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Indiana
University Institutional Review Board. The inclusionary criteria included that each participant be: (a) right-handed, (b) a native speaker
of English, and (c) able to participate in the current longitudinal study
over a two-month span. Participants with dementia were given the
diagnosis of dementia by their neurologists prior to their participation
in the study. Individuals with any type of cortical dementia, including
Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, from mild to moderate severity were included in the current
study. If a participant was taking cognitive enhancement medication
(e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil), the participant and
caregiver were asked to track and record their dosage throughout the
study and report it to the investigator at study completion. Dementia
severity was determined using the standard version of Mini Mental State
Exam-2 (i.e., moderate = 10-18 points, and mild = 19-24 points;
MMSE-2; Folstein, Folstein, McHugh, & Fanjiang, 2010). Control participants had to achieve MMSE-2 scores higher than the cut-off score to
participate in the study. Cut-off scores for control participants were
retrieved from the population-based norms of Crum, Anthony, Bassett,
and Folstein (1993), with age- and education-level specific norms used
for each participant (e.g., 25 for individuals 80-84 years of age with
9-12 years of education).
The exclusionary criteria were: (a) a history of epilepsy, mental
disorders, or neurological disorders other than dementia, (b) claustrophobia, (c) metal implants that have not been MR-safety approved
by a doctor, (d) severe hearing or vision deficits that precluded completing tests and tasks, or (e) a significant level of depressive symptoms
on the Geriatric Depression Scale (i.e., score  10; Faher, Larrabee, &
Crook, 1992; Yesavage et al., 1983). Vision was screened through a
picture-matching task, in which participants were required to match
correctly a stimulus line drawing picture with an identical picture
mixed with one foil picture. For the hearing-screening test, the Speech
Discrimination Screening subtest from Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD; Bayles & Tomoeda, 1993) was given.
For the vision and hearing screening tests, at least 70% accuracy was
required to participate in the current study.
Seven participants with dementia and nine age- and educationmatched healthy participants completed all study procedures (see
Table 1 for demographic information). All participants with dementia,
except participant D2, were taking donepezil or memantine. Based on
caregiver and participant report, no one had dose or frequency of
medication changes during the study, and no one participated in any
behavioral language or cognitive therapy. The two participant groups
did not significantly differ in age, t(14) = -0.74, p = .47, level of
education t(14) = -0.15, p = .88, or sex 2 (1, N = 16) = 0.04,
p = .84. MMSE-2 scores were significantly higher for the control group
versus the dementia group, t(14) = 0.36, p < .01.

2.2.2. fMRI procedures
Each participant completed three separate MRI scanning sessions.
The first two sessions (i.e., T1 and T2) were separated by one week, and
the third session (i.e., T3) was performed two months after the first
session. The purpose of the first two sessions was to examine the reliability of fMRI language measures administered during a relatively
short period of time, and the purpose of T3 was to determine longitudinal neural changes related to language in individuals with dementia without any behavioral therapeutic intervention over the twomonth window. To minimize intra-subject physiological variability,
participants completed a questionnaire regarding factors (e.g., smoking,
alcohol, caffeine, sleep habits; see Appendix A) that might influence
their physiological day-to-day variability prior to each scanning session. Participants were scheduled to come in at the same time of the day
for all three scans, if possible. All participants practiced the scanning
tasks in a mock scanner room before each scanning session to get familiarized with the tasks and the scanning environment, and to minimize practice and learning effects. During the practice, they were required to name random pictures different from the experimental
stimuli.
As the current study was part of a larger investigation, scanning
tasks included two confrontation naming (i.e., noun naming and verb
naming) and three verbal fluency tasks (i.e., semantic fluency, letter
fluency, and action fluency); however, this study focuses on only the
confrontation naming tasks and outcomes, and thus, there is no further
mention of the verbal fluency tasks or findings. Each imaging session
was comprised of five functional runs and one anatomical run. The
order of functional runs was randomized across and within individuals.
It is well established that confrontation naming tasks are sensitive to
dementia (e.g., Balthazar, Cendes, & Damasceno, 2008; Domoto-Reilly,
Sapolsky, Brickhouse, Dickerson, & Initiative, 2012; Garrard, Lambon
Ralph, Patterson, Pratt, & Hodges, 2005; Ostberg, Fernaeus, Hellstrom,
Bogdanovi, & Wahlund, 2005), and previous studies have shown that
fMRI of word production is feasible and can yield good results (e.g.,
Birn, Cox, & Bandettini, 2004; Munhall, 2001). For the confrontation
naming tasks, two sets of 60 black and white line drawing pictures were
used, one for noun naming and one for verb naming. These two stimulus sets were used for all participants and all scanning sessions (see
Appendix B for a complete list). For noun naming, pictures from the
Boston Naming Test (Kaplan, Goodglass, & Weintraub, 2001) were used,
and for verb naming, pictures were chosen from the International Picture Naming Project (Szekely et al., 2004). Word frequency of items was
balanced across noun naming and verb naming based on information in
the SUBTLEXUS corpus (Brysbaert & New, 2009); there was no

2.2. Procedure
2.2.1. Cognitive-linguistic test battery
The Scales of Cognitive and Communicative Ability for
Neurorehabilitation (SCCAN; Milman & Holland, 2003) was administered to measure general cognitive and linguistic abilities in 8 different
areas including reading, writing, verbal comprehension, oral expression, orientation, attention, memory and problem solving. The Vocabulary Assessment Scales (Gerhardstein-Nader, 2013), both the Expressive and Receptive subtests, were given to assess expressive naming
skills and receptive vocabulary abilities, respectively, for different parts
of speech, including verbs and nouns. To assess immediate and delayed

2.3.1. Single subject analysis
To detect brain areas activated by the confrontation naming tasks,
multiple regression and general linear tests were performed on each
subject's data, with motion parameters used as additional regressors.
All SPM(t) maps were thresholded at the voxelwise level of p < .001,
uncorrected, unless otherwise noted. To quantify the amount of variability across sessions within each individual, a measure of cluster
overlap ratio, Dice coefficients (Dice, 1945; Gorgolewski, Storkey,
Bastin, & Pernet, 2012; Rombouts et al., 1997), was computed for each
naming condition contrast (i.e., T1 vs. T2; T1 vs. T3; T2 vs. T3 for noun
naming and verb naming, respectively). Suprathreshold activation
maps (p < .001, uncorrected) were used to calculate the Dice coefficients for all participants. Additionally, Pearson correlation coefficients
were calculated for pairs of time points - [T1 and T2], [T1 and T3], and
[T2 and T3] - for each participant per naming task, using: (a) the
weighted sum of beta values (i.e., effect sizes) obtained from contrast
images, and (b) the t-statistics obtained from SPM(t) maps. The purpose
of these calculations was to delineate whether using effect sizes, as
opposed to using t-statistics yielded substantial differences in quantifying the reliability of brain activation (Gorgolewski, Storkey, Bastin,
Whittle, & Pernet, 2013; Miller et al., 2002, 2009; Wagner et al., 2005).
The result of this comparison should inform us about (a) how reliable
the observed effect sizes remained over time, and (b) how reliable the tstatistics remained over time based on the contrasts of interests (i.e.,
[noun naming > rest] and [verb naming > rest] at T1, T2, and T3).

significant difference between the lists (p > .05), with average word
frequency below 30 for each list.
At the very beginning and end of the confrontation naming paradigms, participants were shown a fixation cross in the middle of the
screen for 30 s, respectively. After the 30-second period at the beginning, each stimulus was shown for 5 s alternating with the resting
condition. Viewing a fixation cross served as the resting condition for
statistical analyses (Binder, 2012). Participants were instructed to name
each target picture within 5 s and rest when the target picture disappeared. The order of stimulus presentation was randomized across
sessions and participants. The inter-stimulus interval (i.e., resting condition) was randomly jittered from 5 to 15 s, the average being 10 s to
optimally detect BOLD signal changes (Birn et al., 2004).

2.3. fMRI data acquisition and analysis
fMRI scanning was conducted on a Siemens 3 T TIM Trio scanner
with a 32-channel radio frequency head coil located in the Imaging
Research Facility (IRF) at Indiana University. In each session, functional
images were obtained in 38 oblique axial slices with 3 mm thickness
(TR = 2,500 ms
and
TE = 27 ms,
flip
angle = 70,
matrix
size = 64 x 64, FOV = 240 mm) using a gradient echo planar imaging
(EPI) sequence in an interleaved manner. All functional images were
preprocessed using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging
Neuroscience), including steps of slice timing correction, motion correction (realignment), spatial normalization, coregistration using the
MNI template, and smoothing (FWHM = 6 mm). The processed images
were entered into the statistical analysis based on the general linear
model and the Gaussian random field theory, which are implemented in
the SPM package. A regressor was built for the noun naming, verb
naming, and resting conditions. A 3D structural image was also taken in
the middle of the functional runs using a sagittal T1-weighted sequence
with an MPRAGE sequence (TR = 1,800 ms, TE = 2. 7 ms, flip
angle = 9, matrix size = 256 x 256, FOV = 256 mm, 192 sagittal
slices, slice thickness 1 mm). Near the end of the data collection, the
MRI scanner went through an upgrade from Tim Trio to Magnetom
Prisma, and two participants with dementia were scanned with the
upgraded scanner for all of their three MRI sessions. The magnet and
the scan parameters for these two participants, however, were the same
as those for all of the other participants.

2.3.2. Random effects analysis
One sample t-tests were performed to obtain whole brain activation
patterns for each group per each session, using the single subject contrast images as input data. The thresholded maps (p < 0.001) for each
of the two confrontation naming paradigms were overlaid onto a template brain for each group. Also the activation maps from three time
points were overlaid together per task for visual comparison. Different
colors were used to note different activation patterns per session: red
for session 1, green for session 2, and blue for session 3. In addition,
paired t-tests were calculated for each group between T1 and T2, and
between T1 and T3 to determine changes in the activation patterns over
time for each noun and verb naming paradigm, with the voxels thresholded at p < .001, uncorrected. Lastly, a 2 by 2 by 2 repeated
measures ANOVA was conducted feeding the [T2-T1] and [T3-T1]

(MMSE-2, SCCAN total), and most language, memory, and executive
function measures (see Supplementary Table 1 in Appendix C). To determine whether there was any difference in the test scores obtained at
T1 versus T3 in each group, paired t-tests were administered. The
control group presented with a significant increase on one verbal
memory measure (i.e., TOMAL-SE Memory for Stories subtest) between
T1 (M = 23.11, SD = 8.49) and T3 (M = 26.33, SD = 8.59), and this
difference exceeded the standard error of measurement (SEM) for that
subtest (SEM = 1). The dementia group showed a significant decrease
on the SCCAN Writing subtest (M = 6.29, SD = 0.95 at T1; M = 5.43,
SD = 1.39 at T3; SEM = 0.5), and a significant increase on the SCCAN
Problem Solving subtest (M = 17, SD = 4.03 at T1; M = 20, SD = 1.92
at T3; SEM = 1.66), TOMAL-SE Memory For Stories (M = 9.14,
SD = 7.58 at T1; M = 12.14, SD = 8.53 at T3; SEM = 1) and Memory
For Stories Delayed subtests (M = 7.71, SD = 7.65 at T1; M = 11.14,
SD = 8.86 at T3; SEM = 1), and the CTONI-2 Pictorial Analogies
(M = 11.86, SD = 4.18 at T1; M = 8.14, SD = 4.53 at T3; SEM = 1).
All these observed differences over time in the dementia group exceeded the SEM of each test.

contrasts for the noun and verb naming paradigms from each participant in the two groups into the model. This analysis allowed examining
whether the amount of activation variability or changes was significantly different between: (a) the two groups (dementia and
healthy), (b) inter-scan intervals (within-subject factor; [T2-T1] = one
week; and [T3-T1] = about two months), and (c) the two naming
paradigms (noun naming and verb naming). All maps were uploaded to
Neurovault.org (https://neurovault.org/collections/4669/).
2.3.3. ICC using ROIs
The SPM(t) contrasts of interest were compared for all of the three
sessions. Thus, average beta values were extracted from regions of interests (ROIs) using the MarsBar toolbox for each group and each
condition during the three sessions. A Shrout-Fleiss two-way single
measure absolute agreement random ICC model (2,1) was also performed as the measure of test-retest comparison (Clement & Belleville,
2009). The average beta values of each ROI were used for each subject
and for each session with the unit of observation being the subject. Six
ROIs were a priori defined anatomically using the AAL ROI library
(Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) through MarsBar. These ROIs included
the following areas: (a) LH anterior cingulate cortex, (b) LH pars triangularis, (c) LH pars opercularis, (d) LH precentral gyrus, (e) LH
postcentral gyrus, and (f) LH superior temporal gyrus. The entire portion of each of these regions was included to calculate the average beta
values as these regions have been previously associated with naming
performance or treatment-induced activation changes in the dementia
population (Beeson et al., 2011; Dressel et al., 2010; Jokel et al., 2016;
Marcotte & Ansaldo, 2010).

3.1.2. In-scanner naming tasks
Repeated measures, two-way ANOVAs were conducted to assess the
main effects of group (between-subject factor), time (within-subject
factor), and the interaction between group and time; group included
two levels (dementia and control) and time included three levels (T1,
T2, and T3). For each of the confrontation naming paradigms, naming
accuracy scores (i.e., percent correct responses) and reaction times (i.e.,
seconds) were entered as dependent variables (see Table 2 and
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). In terms of accuracy, there were statistically significant effects of time on noun naming, F(2, 28) = 11.84,
p < .001, with higher accuracy at T2 than T1 and at T3 than T1, and
on verb naming, F(2, 28) = 5.3, p = .011, with higher accuracy at T2
than T1. Group effects were statistically significant for both noun
naming, F(1, 14) = 6.24, p = .026, and verb naming, F(1, 14) = 13.95,
p = .002, with higher naming accuracy for the control versus dementia
group.
There was a statistically significant effect of time on verb naming
reaction time, F(2, 28) = 3.74, p = .036, with faster reaction times at
T2 than T1, but no effect of time on noun naming reaction times, F(2,
28) = 1.11, p = .343. The group effect was significant for noun naming
reaction times, F(1,14) = 5.49, p = .034, and verb naming reaction
times, F(1,14) = 15.24, p = .002, with faster reaction times for the
control group than the dementia group for both confrontation naming
tasks. The interaction between time and group was not statistically
significant for any confrontation naming dependent variable.
To determine if the naming score differences between two time
points (i.e., T2-T1 and T3-T1) fell within an acceptable range, equivalence tests were conducted for each group and naming task. The TOST
results (see Table 3) indicated that the differences in naming scores
were within the acceptable range (i.e., significantly within the

2.4. In-scanner behavioral data collection and analysis
Participants' overt responses were recorded in the scanner using an
in-house MR-compatible microphone system while they were performing the confrontation naming tasks. The verbatim naming response, percent correct responses (i.e., number of correct responses
divided by 60), and reaction time to each picture stimulus were transcribed and recorded. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare the groups over the three sessions. In addition, to determine
whether the observed differences in the naming scores were large enough to be considered significant differences or whether the differences
were within an acceptable range of variation, equivalence tests (Lakens,
2017; Lakens, Scheel, & Isager, 2018; Pernet, 2017), namely two onesided tests (TOST) for dependent samples, were conducted for each
time pair per group per naming category (i.e., T1-T2 noun, T1-T3 noun,
T2-T3 noun, T1-T2 verb, T1-T3 verb, T2-T3 verb). If the null hypotheses
for the TOSTs are rejected in the equivalence tests, one can conclude
that the differences are within the acceptable variation (i.e., equivalence bounds). The standard error of measurement (SEM) from Vocabulary Assessment Scales (VAS; Gerhardstein-Nader, 2013) and from the
Test of Adolescent and Adult Word Finding - Second Edition (TAAWF-2;
German, 2016) were used to set the equivalence boundaries (i.e., lower
and upper bounds) given that these word retrieval measures retain similar constructs (e.g., assess confrontation naming of both nouns and
verbs) and exhibit relatively strong psychometric reliability and validity as word retrieval measures. The SEM for the VAS and TAWWF-2
were 4.2 (for adults aged 61-70) and 5 (for older adults aged 60-80),
respectively; thus, the average between the two SEMs (i.e., raw score of
4.6) was used for each bound (i.e., -4.6 and 4.6).

significant difference among the observed overlap ratios in the context
of group, grammatical category, and time interval. The result revealed
that there were no significant effects or interactions of these variables
(at p < .05). Thus the pathological process of dementia did not seem to
necessarily alter the level of reproducibility of brain activation patterns
for the current word retrieval paradigms, especially when it was
concerned with the spatial distribution patterns as opposed to the
strength of signals.

equivalent bounds) in all comparisons for the control participants except for the T1-T3 noun naming difference. In contrast, the TOSTs for
the dementia group indicated that the effect sizes for all comparisons
were not significantly within the equivalent bounds; that is, for the
dementia group, the naming score differences between two time points
may not be within the acceptable range, showing a clinically significant
magnitude of change.
3.2. fMRI results

3.2.1.3. Pearson correlation coefficients. The effect sizes obtained from
contrast images of each time point were compared against each other
(T1 vs. T2, T1 vs. T3, and T2 vs. T3) per participant for each naming
paradigm to compute Pearson correlation coefficients. The same
computation procedure was also performed on the t-statistics values
obtained from SPM(t) images. Means and standard deviations of the
Pearson correlation coefficients for each group per naming paradigm
averaged across time comparisons are presented in Table 5; the
coefficients for individual participants are presented in Table 2 of the
supplementary material. Pearson correlation coefficients for all
comparisons were statistically significant at p < .001. The mean
correlation coefficients for contrast maps with respect to noun
naming was 0.558 (SD = 0.310) in the control group, and 0.471
(SD = 0.258) in the dementia group. On the other hand, the mean
correlation coefficients for SPM(t) maps were 0.559 (SD = 0.305) for
the control group and 0.452 (SD = 0.285) for the dementia group,
suggesting that there was only a marginal difference between the
coefficients computed using contrast images as opposed to those
computed using SPM(t) maps. Consistent with these findings in the
noun naming paradigm, the same pattern of results was observed in the
verb naming paradigm as well (see Table 5). That is, the conversion of
the sum of the weighted beta values to t-statistics had nominal effects
on measuring reliability.

3.2.1. Single subject analysis
3.2.1.1. Visual inspection. For visual inspection of variability,
individual whole brain activation patterns were displayed using
maximum intensity projections (MIPs) for each naming task (i.e.,
noun and verb naming) and session (i.e., T1, T2, T3; see
Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 for examples). Confrontation naming
paradigms were thresholded at p < .05, corrected for family-wise error
(FWE). There were no voxels that survived significance testing in a few
occasions (e.g., the verb naming task at T2 for participants C1 and C3;
p < .05, FWE corrected). Visual observation of these activation maps
suggested that the activation patterns were not necessarily the same
within individuals across repeated sessions for each paradigm; there
was also variation in the spatial distribution patterns across individuals.
Generally, control participants compared to those with dementia
showed more robust and widely distributed bilateral activations for
both naming paradigms. The MIPs of some control and dementia
participants indicated substantial variability across sessions (e.g., D5's
noun naming at T1 versus T2; C2's noun naming at T1 versus T2; C5's
verb naming at T1 versus T2).
3.2.1.2. Dice coefficients. The Dice overlap ratios are presented in
Table 4 for each participant along with group means and standard
deviations. These ratios reveal the extent of overlapping areas for the
suprathresholded voxels (p < .001, uncorrected). When averaged
across the three time comparisons (i.e., T1 vs T2, T1 vs. T3, and T2
vs. T3), the mean overlap ratio for noun naming was higher for the
control group (M = 0.623, SD = 0.154, ranging from 0.286 to 0.832)
than the dementia group (M = 0.433, SD = 0.17, ranging from 0.136 to
0.679). Similarly, the average overlap ratio for verb naming was higher
for the control group (M = 0.493, SD = 0.244, ranging from 0.024 to
0.818) than the dementia group (M = 0.463, SD = 0.206, ranging from
0.140 to 0.719). The observed group-level overlap ratios
(approximately 40-60% agreement between sessions) seem
acceptable, but at the individual level, the results suggested that
performing the same word retrieval procedures in scanner does not
necessarily yield the same spatial distribution of brain activation
patterns in some individual cases (e.g., C1 and C3's verb naming),
converging with the evidence from above visual inspection. A repeated
measures ANOVA was further conducted to determine if there was a

3.2.2. Random effects analysis
3.2.2.1. Overlay of activation maps across sessions per group. Activation
maps from T1, T2, and T3 were overlaid on a template brain per group
to compare activation patterns for each naming task across the three
sessions. Visual inspection of the images for both confrontation naming
paradigms (Fig. 1; left panel for noun naming and right panel for verb
naming) indicated that for the control group there were more common
(i.e., white) areas across sessions than for the dementia group; this
finding suggested that the control group exhibited more consistent
spatial distribution of activation patterns during confrontation naming
across sessions than the dementia group.
3.2.2.2. Direct comparison of naming responses at T1 and T3. As previous
longitudinal treatment studies compared activation patterns at pretreatment and post-treatment for noun naming (e.g., Dressel et al.,
2010), activation patterns for our word retrieval paradigms at T1 and

Noun naming. Noun naming at T1 minus T3 resulted in several small
activation clusters including the RH MFG and IFG areas in the control
group, and RH superior temporal gyrus and cingulate gyrus in the dementia group; there was greater activation in these regions at T1
compared to T3. Noun naming at T3 minus T1 also produced small
activation clusters in the RH putamen and RH insula areas for both the
control and dementia groups. These findings indicated that for both
groups, there were changes in the brain activation patterns over two
months without any intervention or medication changes.
Verb naming. For T1 minus T3, neither group showed significant
activation changes. In contrast, both groups did exhibit more activation
at T3 versus T1 in a number of brain regions including LH postcentral
gyrus, bilateral IPL, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, RH STG, RH MCC,
and RH insula. Compared to T1, control participants at T3 demonstrated more activation in LH insula and bilateral globus pallidus, putamen, and lentiform nucleus. The dementia group showed more activation at T3 versus T1 in the following areas: RH MFG, RH SFG, RH IFG,

analysis indicated that these areas showed more variability in the
shorter inter-scan interval (i.e., T2-T1 = 1 week) than in the longer
inter-scan interval (i.e., T3-T1 = 2 months). The main effect of
grammatical category was observed in both hemispheres as well,
including LH superior medial frontal gyrus, insula, IFG, SPL, IPL,
ACC, PCC, and precuneus, and RH superior medial frontal gyrus, SFG,
ACC, MCC, and supplementary motor area. Post-hoc analyses revealed
that of these areas, noun naming exhibited more neural variability over
time in LH precuneus, PCC, insula, IFG, IPL, SPL, and RH MCC. The
other areas showed more variability over time during verb naming than
noun naming. There was a significant interaction between group and
grammatical category in the LH insula, superior medial frontal gyrus,
ACC, MFG, and RH precentral and postcentral gyrus, Rolandic
operculum, IFG, MCC, ACC, precuneus, and calcarine, indicating that
category-related activation variability differed between groups. Posthoc analysis suggested that all of these areas showed more variability in
the control participants' noun naming compared to their verb naming as
opposed to the variability for noun naming and verb naming in the

3.2.2.3. Direct comparison of naming responses at T1 and T2. Activation
patterns for our word retrieval paradigms at T1 and T2 were also
compared for both groups using paired t-tests. The comparisons were
thresholded at p < .001, uncorrected. Consistent with the behavioral
changes in the naming accuracy and reaction times discussed above,
there were significant differences observed in the brain activation
patterns of both groups.
Noun naming. Noun naming at T1 minus T2 resulted in multiple
small activation clusters in the control group, including LH insula, LH
thalamus, RH IFG, RH STG, RH ACC, and RH MCC. For the dementia
group, T2 compared to T1 showed small activation clusters in the LH
supplementary motor and RH postcentral areas. Noun naming at T2
minus T1 yielded small activation clusters in bilateral STG and RH insula areas in the control group, and bilateral Rolandic operculum, LH
supramarginal gyrus, and RH ACC in the dementia group.
Verb naming. Verb naming at T1 minus T2 indicated that there were
no suprathreshold voxels in the control group, whereas the dementia
group exhibited small activations in the RH IFG and LH supplementary
motor area. Verb naming at T2 minus T1 revealed that the control
group showed many small activation clusters in: LH PCC, LH precuneus,
bilateral angular gyrus, and bilateral MCG. In contrast, there were no
suprathreshold voxels in the dementia group.

3.2.3. Test-retest reliability of fMRI activation examined by ICCs
Given that thresholded activation maps can exaggerate small differences between maps because of the nonlinearity of the thresholding
operation (Aron et al., 2006; Clement & Belleville, 2009), a series of
two-way, random-effect models was used to yield ICCs (2,1) on an ROI
basis to compare test-retest reliability across regions and tasks (see
Table 7). Both groups exhibited significant ICCs for verb naming in the
following areas: (a) LH pars opercularis, (b) LH postcentral gyrus, (c)
LH precentral gyrus, and (d) LH STG. Only the control group showed
significant ICCs in the pars triangularis for verb naming. On the contrary, there was no single region that demonstrated significant ICCs for
noun naming in either group.
To ensure that differences observed between sessions were not due
to changes in the amount of head motion across sessions, further analysis was conducted using six motion parameters obtained from the
preprocessing step for head motion correction. Repeated measures
ANOVAs were computed with time (T1, T2, and T3) as the withinsubject factor and group (dementia and control) as the between-subject
factor for each of the six dependent variables for head motion (i.e.,
translational displacements x, y, and z; rotational displacements pitch,
roll, and yaw). Results indicated that there were no effects of group F(1,
14) = 0.042, p = .84, time F(2, 28) = 0.22, p = .80, or interaction of

3.2.2.4. Comparison of variability across groups, inter-scan intervals, and
naming paradigms. Repeated measures ANOVA results (p < 0.005,
k = 20) revealed main effects of group, inter-scan interval, and
grammatical category, suggesting that all of these three independent
variables contributed to the amount of observed neural variability (see
Fig. 2 and Table 6). Therefore, we further conducted post-hoc t-tests to
delineate the directionality of these observed effects. The spatial
distribution of the activation signals related to the group effects
involved both RH and LH regions, including bilateral IFG, insula,
supramarginal gyrus, post- and precentral gyrus, Rolandic operculum,
MCC, and LH STG, calcarine, and precuneus. Post-hoc analyses
indicated that healthy older adults activated all these regions more
strongly over time than the dementia group. The main effect of interscan interval was found in the RH ACC and SFG areas, and the post-hoc

over a two-month period in the absence of cognitive-linguistic intervention, participants with and without dementia presented different
activation patterns at the individual and group levels, albeit the extent
of variability was different across individuals, groups, and word retrieval paradigms. Also, based on a quantitative measure of test-retest
reliability (i.e., ICCs), noun and verb word retrieval paradigms showed
different degrees of reliability; reliability measured by ICCs additionally
varied across groups and different brain regions.

Visual inspection and use of Dice overlap ratios for brain activation
maps from multiple time points (i.e., T1, T2, and T3) suggested that the
activation patterns in terms of intensity and spatial distribution were
not necessarily the same within individuals throughout repeated sessions for each word retrieval paradigm; variation in spatial distribution
was also demonstrated across individuals. Whereas there were increasingly more activated areas observed in some participants (e.g.,
C1's noun naming at T1 and T2; D3's noun naming at T1 and T2), other
participants showed fewer or smaller activation regions (e.g., C4's noun
naming at T1 and T2; D5's noun naming at T1 and T2) over time, although the general activation patterns looked grossly similar within
individuals in both groups. Such variability within and across individuals and scanning sessions are consistent with preceding investigations that included visual observation of individual participants'
activation maps to examine variability of fMRI signals for cognitive or
language paradigms in the healthy young adult population (Chen &
Small, 2007; Mahowald & Fedorenko, 2016; McGonigle et al., 2000;
Rutten et al., 2002; Wei et al., 2004). As we are not aware of prior
research including visual inspection of activation maps for healthy
older adults or individuals with dementia, the current findings uniquely
extend this literature. Moreover, the test-retest reliability quantified by

time and group F(2, 28) = 0.40, p = .67 for motion dependent variables. Therefore, the amount of head motion did not significantly vary
across sessions, and the fMRI activation variability observed in the
current study did not stem from head motion artifacts.
4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine the test-retest reliability of
confrontation naming paradigms (i.e., noun and verb naming) used in
fMRI for individuals with dementia and typical-aging adults. Generally,
the findings suggested that one-time fMRI scanning might inadequately
represent an individual's typical brain activation patterns to monitor
longitudinal changes in dementia or in typical aging. That is, when the
same fMRI naming measures were repeatedly administered three times
39

STG) were affected in our study by repeated fMRI measurements in
both dementia and healthy aging participants.
The practice effects documented thus far in the literature have also
been found to persist for a relatively long time in healthy populations.
For example, Kurland et al. (2018) examined practice effects for word
retrieval processes in 10 healthy, older adults. These researchers had
their participants practice naming a part of a set of action and object
word stimuli several times before they were scanned, and repeated the
tasks and stimulus items twice within an MRI session; they also iterated
these same MRI procedures after a month. Item-specific practice effects
(practiced > unpracticed items) were seen mainly in the bilateral
precuneus and LH IPL, and the participants showed greater activation
in the RH parahippocampal gyrus during session 1 compared to session
2 when naming practiced versus unpracticed items. With a sample of 10
healthy young adults, Meister et al. (2005) similarly reported that decreased brain activation in LH IFG and ITG was seen by the effect of
naming repetition over a long-term period (i.e., 6 weeks). It should be
noted that the current study extended these previous findings regarding
long-term maintenance of practice effects and demonstrated that even
individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and persistent cognitive
deterioration showed significant, long-lasting (2 months) practice effects in terms of word retrieval processing.
There were multiple brain regions in both hemispheres that exhibited increased activation as the MRI sessions were iterated in the
current study. This increased activation was seen more in the RH brain
areas, and more so in the dementia group than the control group, which
is most prominently seen in the T3-T1 comparison (i.e., paired t-tests).
That is, the behavioral changes in individuals with dementia were observed in light of increased RH activations. Such concomitant behavioral and activation changes might be seen as a compensatory mechanism of the brain to upkeep these participants' cognitive
performance in the midst of continued neurophysiological deterioration. The HAROLD (Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adult;
Cabeza, 2002) model proposes that the brain reorganizes to adapt to
age-related changes in terms of anatomy and physiology. The current
results suggest an extension to the model. The deterioration of brain
efficiency observed in those with dementia may result in greater recruitment of RH regions as a compensatory mechanism. Additionally, as
Kurland et al. (2018) recently noted, emerging evidence coming from
multiple investigations regarding the consistent recruitment of RH
areas during repeated word retrieval processes will help researchers
explicate the role of RH on treatment-induced recovery processes for
those with language impairments. Recruitment of RH regions observed
after language treatment may not reflect the effects of treatment per se
or reorganization of language network due to treatment, but might
instead indicate, at least in part, effects of repeated language tasks.
Procedures for data collection or analysis may contribute to the
variability of activation patterns as well, including physiological artifacts such as cardiac and respiratory-related signal changes, and head
motion (Chen & Small, 2007; Fournier et al., 2014; Gorgolewski et al.,
2013; Lund, Norgaard, Rostrup, Rowe, & Paulson, 2005). Hence it is
critical to design an experiment without these confounding factors.
Bennett and Miller (2010) have suggested several practical ways to
improve fMRI reliability, such as: (a) increasing signal to noise ratio, (b)
increasing the number of experimental runs, (c) training participants on
the task in advance to actual scans so that there are no wasted scans,
and (d) scanning participants at the same time of the day for stable
circadian rhythm. Per the fMRI analysis pipeline, the artifacts that
could be caused by excessive head motion were corrected and temporal
noise due to physiological cycles (i.e., cardiac or respiratory cycles) was
filtered. Also we included as many runs and trials as possible into our
experimental design. To minimize practice effects, our participants
practiced word retrieval tasks out loud immediately before going into
the scanner every session, using practice stimuli that were different
from the experimental stimuli. There were also attempts to scan participants the same time of day; however, given limited scanning time

Dice coefficients revealed that the observed levels of agreement between the two suprathreshold activation maps for word retrieval
paradigms were moderate according to Kappa Statistic Strength of
Agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977). The two word retrieval paradigms
(noun vs. verb) yielded comparable reliability indices. Their study in
particular highlighted that eliciting a motor response (i.e., speech
output) in the scanner yields relatively higher reliability compared to
covert tasks that do not elicit motor responses. Indeed, a previous reliability study examining a covert confrontation naming paradigm in
ten healthy adults (Harrington et al., 2006) reported that between
sessions, there was only about 30% activation overlap in the inferior
frontal lobe region, suggesting relatively lower overlap ratios compared
to those observed in our healthy controls (approximately 50% spatial
overlap). In the current study there were, however, some individual
cases that exhibited only slight to fair (Landis & Koch, 1977) overlap
between sessions. In the clinical standpoint of single subject experimental designs, this calls for further caution in terms of interpreting
brain imaging results: Changes that are seen on two different activation
maps (pre vs. post-treatment) may not represent direct effects of
treatment.
In addition, direct statistical comparisons of brain activation patterns indicated that at least some areas demonstrated increased or decreased signal intensities over time, resulting in different activation
areas surviving the statistical thresholds for both groups. These areas
included, for example, RH putamen and insula for both individuals with
dementia and healthy older adults, across the two time points separated
by two months (i.e., T1 and T3) when using the noun naming paradigm.
Direct comparison of verb naming also yielded similar results, revealing
increased or decreased recruitment of certain brain areas at two different time points for the same task at the group level, again without
any cognitive-linguistic intervention. Furthermore, the level of these
changes differed across groups, categories, and inter-scan intervals. For
example, some group effects were demonstrated in various bilateral
regions including the IFG, insula, supramarginal gyrus, and pre- and
postcentral gyri. These findings of activation variability draw additional
attention to the current research practice of using single pre-treatment
and post-treatment fMRI scans as a biomarker to track treatment-induced changes (e.g., Beeson et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2009), presumably because researchers completing these longitudinal dementia
treatment studies have assumed reliability in their fMRI results. The
current study found, however, that differences in the intensity and
spatial distribution of activation can be observed even without any
intervention, both in individuals with dementia and healthy older
adults.
Although the possible causes of differences in fMRI results have
rarely been examined in dementia, there are studies involving healthy
young or older adults that have attributed variability in brain activity to
practice (or priming), changes in cognitive strategy, compliance to the
task, and habituation effects (Basso et al., 2013; Bennett & Miller, 2010;
Gorgolewski et al., 2013; Kurland, Liu, & Stokes, 2018; Meister et al.,
2005; Meltzer, Postman-Caucheteux, McArdle, & Braun, 2009; van
Turennout et al., 2000, 2003; Wagner et al., 2005). Especially when
using word retrieval tasks, familiarity with the experimental task and
exposure to the same stimulus items have been found to cause variability in the brain activity of healthy adults (Basso et al., 2013; Kurland
et al., 2018; Meister et al., 2005; Meltzer et al., 2009; Petersen, Van
Mier, Fiez, & Raichle, 1998; van Turennout et al., 2000, 2003). For
example, both increased and decreased brain activation occurred when
a picture naming task was administered repeatedly to 10 healthy young
adults (Basso et al., 2013). When these 10 participants were shown the
same stimulus items repeatedly in two scanning sessions separated by
10 days, decreased signals were observed in bilateral precentral gyrus
and STG, LH MOG, and cerebellum, whereas hyperactivation was observed in the PCC. Basso et al. concluded that exposure and familiarity
to the task and stimulus items had a significant impact on distinct areas
of brain activation at two time points. Some similar regions (e.g., LH

E.J. Paek, et al.

term period in individuals with dementia; instead, dementia researchers have focused on more long-term repeated measures to evaluate annual or other longitudinal declines (e.g., Zehnder et al., 2007).
Therefore, similar to typical aging adults, our data suggest that individuals with dementia do demonstrate significant practice effects for
confrontation naming tasks over two months. We further investigated if
the amount of change observed was within clinically acceptable ranges
using equivalence tests. Whereas the differences observed in the control
group were mostly within the acceptable range of changes, the amount
of change in the naming scores of participants with dementia were
found to be significantly outside the acceptable range, confirming
progressive word retrieval difficulties in individuals with dementia.
The observed activation differences make it difficult to assume that
participants put the same amount of effort into each session (Belleville
et al., 2011). For example, it is possible that participants had to exert
more effort when completing the tasks during the first session than the
second session, to achieve the same level of performance; such different
effort levels might offer an explanation for the activation differences
between sessions. Indeed, changes in brain activation have been observed in the absence of behavioral changes due to practice effects and
decreased effort in healthy young adults when using a working memory
task (Landau, Schumacher, Garavan, Druzgal, & D'esposito, 2004), and
this might be accountable for the current phenomenon as well.

availability within the MRI facility and subsequent scheduling conflicts,
our participants could not always be scanned at the same time of the
day. No participant reported substantial changes in their drinking,
sleeping, or smoking habits over the course of two months, as measured
by our physiological variability questionnaire. Therefore, it is unlikely
that the variability related to data collection procedures compromised
the test-retest reliability of the fMRI word retrieval paradigms used in
the current study.
4.2. Behavioral changes
When assessed with the same cognitive and language measures over
two months, participants with dementia and without dementia demonstrated significant performance changes without any intervention
between the two measurements. Specifically, control participants presented with a significant increase on one verbal memory measure. This
difference was statistically significant and additionally fell outside the
standard error of measurement for that test (Reynolds & Voress, 2012).
This finding concurs with prior research as increased scores on verbal
memory tasks attributed to practice effects are well documented in
typically aging, older adults (Ball et al., 2002; Belleville et al., 2006;
Benedict & Zgaljardic, 1998; Dodge, Wang, Chang, & Ganguli, 2011;
Duff et al., 2008; Lamar, Resnick, & Zonderman, 2003; Rabbitt, Diggle,
Holland, & McInnes, 2004; Zehnder, Blasi, Berres, Spiegel, & Monsch,
2007).
On the other hand, participants with dementia exhibited decreased
performance on a writing test at the later time point, while showing
increased scores on certain problem solving, nonverbal intelligence test,
and verbal memory measures. All of these changes were statistically
significant and exceeded the standard error of measurement for each
measure. Previous studies regarding practice effects in individuals with
dementia have shown mixed findings, in that some practice effects are
reported in the memory domain (Duff, Chelune, & Dennett, 2012;
Hammers et al., 2011; Machulda et al., 2013) whereas other studies
found no practice effects for memory or word retrieval tasks
(Hassenstab et al., 2015; Mathews et al., 2014). For instance, Machulda
et al. (2013) found that individuals with dementia or MCI exhibited
practice effects in the memory domain while concomitantly showing
consistent decline in other cognitive domains such as attention, visuospatial, as well as language skills. Findings from the current study
add to prior dementia research documenting improved performance on
memory and cognitive measures across repeated measurements. In
contrast to Mahulda et al.'s findings, in our dataset broader decline
across the language measures were not observed; such conflicting
findings may possibly be due to different time intervals between measurements (i.e., 15-month interval in Machulda et al. vs. 2-month interval in the current study) and the current study's small sample size
and subsequently limited statistical power (i.e., 443 individuals with
MCI or dementia in Machulda et al., vs. 7 individuals with dementia).
In-scanner task performance of the confrontation naming paradigms
also exhibited changes across different time points. The naming accuracy scores as well as reaction times were significantly different across
the three time points. In particular, both groups showed slight but
significant improvements in their noun and verb naming accuracy at T2
compared to T1. Verb naming reaction times were also significantly
faster at T2 than T1, although no significant reaction time changes were
found for noun naming. The word retrieval performance changes observed in our control participants were not surprising given that practice effects or priming effects on word retrieval tasks are well documented in healthy, young and older adults (Cooper, Lacritz, Weiner,
Rosenberg, & Cullum, 2004; Goldberg, Harvey, Wesnes, Snyder, &
Schneider, 2015; Kurland et al., 2018; Meister et al., 2005; Sachs et al.,
2012; van Turennout et al., 2000, 2003; Wilson, Watson, Baddeley,
Emslie, & Evans, 2000; Zec, Markwell, Burkett, & Larsen, 2005). There
has been, however, a paucity of research examining the impact of repeated administration of word retrieval tasks over a relatively short-

4.3. Comparison of reliability between groups, regions, and different naming
measures
The magnitude of test-retest reliability was also assessed by calculating single measure ICCs in six pre-defined ROIs related to word retrieval processing (i.e., pars opercularis, pars triangularis, precentral
gyrus, postcentral gyrus, STG, and ACC). Most of those brain regions
and both noun and verb naming tasks that demonstrated statistically
significant ICCs showed a fair to good magnitude of reliability
(poor < 0.4, 0.4 < fair to good < 0.75, excellent > 0.75; Fleiss,
2011; Plichta et al., 2012). Nonetheless, ICCs varied across groups,
brain regions, and tasks. For example, in the pars triangularis, neither
naming task exhibited significant correlation coefficients in the dementia group, whereas both tasks showed fair to good reliability in the
control group. Previous reliability investigations have demonstrated
mixed findings when comparing groups of older adults and those with
MCI: Higher ICCs in the healthy group have been reported (Putcha
et al., 2011) but no differences between these groups have been found
(Clement & Belleville, 2009). The variable ICCs identified in the current
study add to prior findings and underscore that fMRI reliability substantially depends on the nature of the experimental paradigm, participant characteristics, and the regions of interest.
It is noteworthy that the verb naming paradigm yielded significant,
fair to excellent ICCs in most of the ROIs for both groups. In contrast,
and unexpectedly, the noun naming paradigm, which was very similar
to the verb naming paradigm in terms of experimental design (i.e.,
number of trials, structure of stimulus presentation, inter-stimulus interval, and mode of response), analysis pipelines, and participants'
percent accuracy and reaction time, did not show similar levels of reliability. This consistency observed across regions and groups for the
verb naming paradigm may indicate the potential utility and robustness
of this paradigm when used with clinical populations as well as healthy
older adults. Indeed, ample evidence suggests that individuals with
dementia show more impairment in action naming than object naming
(Almor et al., 2009; Cappa et al., 1998; Cotelli et al., 2006; Druks et al.,
2006; Hillis et al., 2006; Masterson et al., 2007). Thus, the addition of
verb naming to fMRI paradigms would aid in monitoring longitudinal
changes in dementia given its higher test-retest reliability compared to
the noun paradigms and high sensitivity to detect word retrieval deficits.
Regarding brain regions, ACC showed no reliable activation patterns in terms of the ICCs, whereas other regions had significant ICCs

5. Conclusion and future directions

for at least one task in at least one participant group. One plausible
reason for this lack of reliability and stability in the activation of ACC
might be that the effort of monitoring varies more rapidly across sessions than other language and cognitive processes invoked by the word
retrieval tasks. ACC has been established to be involved in verbal fluency paradigms in healthy young adults (Fu et al., 2006; Fu et al., 2002;
Weiss et al., 2003) as well as in the phonological and semantic processing of words in healthy older adults and individuals with dementia
(Dressel et al., 2010; Jokel et al., 2016). However, ACC has also been
found to play a critical role in error detection, inhibition, response
suppression, and monitoring processes (see Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000;
Price, 2012 for review) rather than linguistic (phonological, semantic,
or lexical) processes. In fact, Milham, Banich, Claus, and Cohen (2003)
found that compared to other brain regions such as LH MFG or IFG,
activity within ACC dropped off quickly with repeated fMRI measures
during a variant of the Stroop task in healthy young adults. In addition,
regions that are relatively less related to the task under investigation
have been shown to have lower reliability estimates in amnestic MCI
(Zanto et al., 2014). Accordingly, in the current study, ACC might have
shown a smaller magnitude of reliability given that it is relatively less
tied to the core language processes supporting noun and verb word
retrieval compared to other ROIs.

The current study extended the extant dementia literature by delineating test-retest reliability for overt fMRI word retrieval measures in
dementia. Our findings reinforce the recommendation for the introduction of multiple baseline fMRI measures, as used in Fridriksson
et al. (2007), and also suggest that multiple post-treatment scans may
be needed to yield a reliable "picture" of fMRI treatment effects. Ways
to improve fMRI reliability will need to be explored, including assurance of enough practice before participants go into the MRI scanner, or
combining imaging results from multiple scan tasks or multiple scan
sessions (e.g., is combining two sessions more or less reliable than
combining three sessions) to establish reliable baseline activation in
both healthy and patient populations. A small number of researchers
have conducted multiple baseline scanning sessions before training,
albeit not necessarily with individuals with dementia (Belleville et al.,
2011; Fridriksson et al., 2007; Fridriksson, Morrow-Odom, Moser,
Fridriksson, & Baylis, 2006). For example, Fridriksson et al. (2006)
executed three pre-treatment scans in which their three participants
with aphasia completed an overt object naming task. The three baseline
fMRI scans were separated by 2-3 days. The authors used a local analysis of mixed effects to calculate mean brain activation patterns across
the three baseline scans, and accordingly, established a reliable baseline
to which to compare post-treatment changes in their participants with
aphasia. Given the importance of fMRI utilization in clinical populations for patient selection, and monitoring treatment effects and disease
progression (Kurland et al., 2004, 2018), it is vital to establish valid
experimental designs and begin with correct assumptions about the
reliability of fMRI language measures for dementia.

4.4. Limitations
The current study includes some limitations that call for careful
interpretation of the findings. First, the participant sample size was
small, with only 7 participants with dementia and 9 control participants. Most prior fMRI test-retest reliability studies, however, similarly
included less than 10 participants, and many studies recruited only a
restricted range of subjects such as university undergraduate students
or healthy young adults (e.g., Aron et al., 2006; Brandt et al., 2013;
Gonzalez-Castillo & Talavage, 2011; Harrington et al., 2006; Wei et al.,
2004). In this sense, for the SPM full factorial ANOVA, relatively liberal
statistical thresholds were employed, and it should be kept in mind that
the current investigation is an exploratory study; thus, the results
should be interpreted cautiously. Additionally, because only individuals
who could tolerate the scanner and the duration of scan time (i.e.,
approximately an hour per session) were recruited and participated in
the study, our sample might be biased toward those who have more
tolerance. Also the scanner was upgraded near the end of the data
collection (i.e., from Siemens Tim Trio to Mangetom Prisma). Therefore, two individuals with dementia had to be scanned with the new
scanner, although the magnet was not replaced.
Another limitation pertains to the level of difficulty of the word
retrieval tasks. Because both groups were given the same stimulus items
and went through the same procedures, participants with dementia
might have perceived more task difficulty, and thus experienced increased effort, inattention to the task, or negative emotional responses
such as frustration or anxiety in the scanner compared to the typical
aging participants (Rapp, Caplan, Edwards, Visch-Brink, & Thompson,
2013). These extralinguistic components could have contributed to
more variability in the dementia versus control group, obscuring
identifying activations related solely to word retrieval processes. Indeed, some previous research suggests that reliability is higher when
there are decreased demands on attention or working memory, or if the
task is ecological and thus can invoke well-exercised mechanisms across
individuals (Chen & Small, 2007; Specht et al., 2003). What should also
be noted here, however, is that if we had used only easy tasks or items
to match the level of perceived difficulty for both groups, it would have
been more difficult to find answers to our research questions given that
investigators are interested in determining neural changes related to
treatment-induced improvements. That is, we should be able to observe
patients' neural responses to relatively difficult items that are difficult
enough to incorrectly respond to pre-treatment and correctly respond to
post-treatment to demonstrate improvement and intervention effects.

6. Statement of significance
The current study investigated the replicability of fMRI measured
brain activation in people with dementia and healthy older adults. The
results shed light on how neural responses change over time using
confrontation naming tasks and this work aligns well with the goals of
Brain and Language by presenting an interdisciplinary approach to help
understand neural mechanisms of language..
