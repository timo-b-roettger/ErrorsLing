ABSTRACT
We examined spoken sentence comprehension in school-age children with developmental dyslexia or
language impairment (LI), compared to age-matched and younger controls. Sentence-picture matching
tasks were employed under three different working memory (WM) loads, two levels of syntactic
difficulty, and two sentence lengths. Phonological short-term memory (STM) skills and their relation
to sentence comprehension performance were also examined. When WM load was minimized, the
LI group performed more poorly on the sentence comprehension task compared to the age-matched
control group and the dyslexic group. Across groups, sentence comprehension performance generally
decreased as the WM load increased, but this effect was somewhat more pronounced in the dyslexic
group compared to the age-matched group. Moreover, both the LI and dyslexic groups showed poor
phonological STM compared to the age-matched control group, and a significant correlation was
observed between phonological STM and sentence comprehension performance under demanding
WM loads. The results indicate subtle sentence processing difficulties in dyslexia that might be
explained as resulting from these children's phonological STM limitations.

Children with developmental dyslexia fail to develop age appropriate reading
skills despite normal-range nonverbal intelligence, adequate learning opportunities, and the absence of a frank neurological disorder (Snowling, 2000). Although
dyslexia is by definition a reading disorder, there is a strong consensus that spoken language deficits also play a role in reading failure. Specifically, theories
suggest that difficulties with phonological processing impair the ability to learn
consistencies in the mapping between letters and sounds, which in turn, impacts
the ability to efficiently read familiar and novel words (Bradley & Bryant, 1983;

Stanovich & Siegel, 1994; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). Although there is
much evidence in support of the strong relationship between phonological deficits
and reading failure in children with dyslexia, less attention has been devoted to
whether these children also have nonphonological language deficits. It has even
been suggested that children with dyslexia have relatively normal nonphonological
language skills, which they use to compensate for phonological deficits throughout reading development (Bishop & Snowling, 2004). However, language deficits
outside the domain of phonology have been observed in children with dyslexia.
McArthur, Hogben, Edwards, Heath, and Mengler (2000) found that in a sample
of 110 children with dyslexia, over half of the children scored at least one standard
deviation below the mean across tests of comprehension and production of syntax
and vocabulary. There is also evidence that language skills in 2- to 3-year-old
children, such as the syntactic complexity and vocabulary size, are significant
predictors of later reading accuracy and comprehension (Scarborough, 1990).
These studies raise the possibility that children with dyslexia have nonphonological language problems in addition to phonological deficits. Consistent with this,
dyslexia has been found to overlap moderately with specific language impairment
(SLI; Catts, Adolf, Hogan, & Ellis Weismer, 2005; McArthur et al., 2000). SLI
is a distinct disorder from dyslexia in which oral language is impaired, especially
with respect to grammatical processing (Bishop, 1997). However, the limited
number of direct comparisons made across these groups in the literature makes it
difficult to assess whether nonphonological deficits in dyslexia are similar to those
observed in children with SLI. Thus, the current study focused on the nature and
extent of language deficits in dyslexia, especially with respect to spoken sentence
comprehension. Rispens and Been (2007) examined sentence comprehension in
SLI and dyslexic groups, and found that children with dyslexia were poorer than
control children, but better than children with SLI. In the current study, we also
compared sentence comprehension in children with dyslexia and language impairment (LI), and evaluated the extent to which sentence comprehension problems in
either group are grounded in poor syntactic processing over limited verbal working
memory (WM).
THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN READING, SYNTAX,
AND PHONOLOGY

Spoken sentence comprehension involves storing and processing verbal material.
Verbal information tends to be temporarily stored in a phonological code (phonological short-term memory [STM]) to enable further processing in WM (i.e.,
verbal WM; Just & Carpenter, 1992). Presumably, if verbal material is not stored
adequately, it makes the task of syntactic processing all the more difficult. As noted
earlier, phonological deficits are quite prevalent in children with dyslexia (Bradley
& Bryant, 1983; Stanovich & Siegel, 1994; Wagner et al., 1994). Shankweiler
and colleagues (Mann, Shankweiler, & Smith 1984; Shankweiler et al., 1995;
Shankweiler, Smith, & Mann, 1984; Smith, Macaruso, Crain, & Shankweiler,
1989) have proposed that apparent syntax deficits in dyslexia are caused by
an underlying phonological deficit, which impedes the temporary storage of
verbal material. This raises the question of whether children with dyslexia have

143

syntax deficits, or whether problems with syntactic processing can be explained
by limitations in verbal WM.
We first review evidence concerning syntactic processing problems in dyslexia,
and whether these interact with these children's phonological processing deficits.
There is some evidence for a relationship between syntactic deficits and reading failure. Rispens, Roeleven, and Koster (2004), found that 8-year-old Dutchspeaking children with dyslexia were less able to detect errors in subject-verb
agreement than chronological age (CA)-matched children. Typically, spoken sentence comprehension is measured with a sentence-picture matching task, in which
the pictures provide an interpretation of the target and distractor. However, the task
demands in the Rispens et al. (2004) study were quite high, and children needed to
rely on their ability to store the verbal material, without supporting picture context,
to make a judgment on the subject-verb agreement in the sentence. Thus, it might
be argued that the children with dyslexia in this study performed poorly because
of the high storage and processing demands. In a later study that employed a
similar task, Rispens and Been (2007) observed that children with dyslexia were
poorer than control children at making subject-verb agreement decisions, but still
performed better than SLI children. This finding also raises the possibility that
syntax deficits in dyslexia are more subtle than what is observed in SLI.
Studies that have employed sentence-picture matching tasks have usually failed
to detect syntax deficits in dyslexia. Smith et al. (1989) found that a group of
second grade poor readers did not perform differently from a control group on a
test of spoken sentence comprehension; both groups found syntactically complex
sentences more difficult, but there was no significant interaction with group and
sentence complexity. A subsequent study employed a yes/no judgment task in
which children needed to decide if a spoken sentence matched a picture. This
test also failed to reveal differences between children with dyslexia and control
children (Shankweiler et al., 1995).
These findings notwithstanding, there is some support for the idea that syntactic
processing is a significant predictor of later reading skills. Botting, Simkin, and
Conti-Ramsden (2006) found that in a group of 11-year-old poor readers, the
strongest predictor of word recognition and reading comprehension was sentence
comprehension at age 7. Sentence comprehension in this study was determined
through the Test for the Reception of Grammar (TROG; Bishop, 1989), which tests
children's comprehension of sentences that have increasingly complex syntactic
structure, while minimizing semantic processing and storage demands. This test
was found to be the most significant predictor of word recognition even when a
phonology test was entered into the equation. However, the phonology test used in
this study was unlike typical phonological processing measures, and carried lexical
and semantic demands. Consequently, it is unclear whether a close relationship
between sentence comprehension and reading failure would be observed when
typical phonological processing abilities are considered.
The relationship among syntax, phonology, and reading skills has also been
examined in typically developing children. Tumner (1989) examined sentence
processing and reading longitudinally in a large group of school-aged children
and found that syntactic skills in the first grade were a significant predictor of
nonword reading accuracy in the second grade, even when typical phonological

144

awareness abilities were controlled. However, in an older group of children,
Gottardo, Stanovich, and Siegel (1996) found that sentence comprehension did
not predict unique variance in reading single words, nonwords, or reading comprehension in a large group of third grade children, once phonological processing and verbal WM were controlled. Results like these suggest that syntax
deficits observed in dyslexia may be attributed to phonological and verbal WM
deficits.
Phonological STM is relied on during spoken sentence comprehension because
words and phrases must be temporarily stored to understand the sentence. Children
with dyslexia appear to have phonological STM deficits, shown most commonly
through poor performance on nonword repetition and also poor sentence repetition
(Catts et al., 2005; Mann, Shankweiler, & Smith, 1984; Shankweiler et al., 1984).
There is also evidence that STM deficits are present in preschool-aged children at
risk for dyslexia (de Bree, Rispens, & Gerrits, 2007). Moreover, there is support
for the theory that phonological STM predicts reading achievement (Mann &
Liberman, 1984). Spoken sentence comprehension involves more than phonological STM because verbal information must also be processed. In particular, the
listener must parse its syntactic form and decode the compositional semantics of
the sentence. These combined storage and processing components of sentence
comprehension are proposed to make up verbal WM (Just & Carpenter, 1992).
On this view, deficits in phonological STM would seem to impede verbal WM
required during spoken sentence comprehension, and ultimately interfere with
children's ability to process the syntactic information.
One prediction of the processing limitation hypothesis proposed by Shankweiler
et al. (1984) is that children with dyslexia should process syntax normally when
storage and processing demands are minimized. One way to measure phonological
STM is through a sentence repetition task. Shankweiler et al. (1984) found that
children with dyslexia performed more poorly than control children when asked
to repeat complex sentences (e.g., The fireman watching the soldier bandaged
himself ). It was interpreted that phonological deficits made it difficult to adequately store verbal material in children with dyslexia. However, on a separate
occasion, these same children with dyslexia were tested for comprehension of
these sentences, through a sentence-picture matching task, and they performed
no differently from control children. One possible explanation for good sentence
comprehension despite poor sentence repetition is that in the sentence comprehension task, children were able to encode the detailed picture context before
and during the presentation of the spoken sentence. The picture interpretations of
the target may have decreased the storage demands involved in the task, whereas
these interpretations were not available during the sentence repetition task. Consequently, the storage demands may have been greater in the sentence repetition
task compared to the sentence comprehension task.
The previous studies that failed to reveal syntax deficits in dyslexia also employed procedures that minimized processing demands by providing rich contextual support for sentence processing (Shankweiler et al., 1995; Smith et al.,
1989). Consequently, these designs may not have been sensitive enough to capture
the effects of verbal WM demands on syntactic processing. For instance, Mann
et al. (1984) employed a different procedure to study sentence comprehension

Applied Psycholinguistics 31:1
Robertson & Joanisse: Spoken sentence comprehension

145

in dyslexia, which provided less detailed visual context and thus more strain on
WM. Rather than using detailed pictures, toy objects were used to represent the
subjects and objects, and were presented just before and during the presentation of
the sentence. After hearing the sentence, children needed to act out the sentence
with the objects, and show they understood the syntactic relations among the subject, object, and verb. This procedure placed demands on verbal WM, as children
needed to retain the information long enough to map out the syntactic structure of
the sentence. The objects themselves contained less context than the pictures used
in the earlier study, which depicted the actions and relations between the object,
subject, and verb. In this task, children with dyslexia did show poorer comprehension compared to control children. Moreover, they also showed poor repetition of
these same sentences when tested on a separate occasion. The results of this study
suggested that deficits in temporary storage of verbal material could make syntactic processing difficult for children with dyslexia. Overall then, there is evidence
that children with dyslexia have problems with spoken sentence comprehension.
However, there is some uncertainty as to whether these represent a syntactic
impairment, or instead, whether they are grounded in verbal WM constraints.
To summarize, the literature is equivocal on sentence comprehension deficits in
dyslexia. The role of verbal WM in sentence comprehension has not been clearly
manipulated in previous dyslexic studies. Studies that have imposed apparent WM
demands have found syntax deficits in dyslexia (Mann et al., 1984). In addition,
some previous sentence comprehension tests that involved WM demands because
of the nature of the task have also revealed syntax problems in dyslexia (Rispens
& Been, 2007; Rispens et al., 2004). In contrast, although studies that have failed
to observe syntax problems might have involved relatively weak WM demands
(Shankweiler et al., 1995; Smith et al., 1989). One way to address these mixed
results is using a stronger evaluation of sentence comprehension in dyslexia. A
clear manipulation of WM within one sentence comprehension study is needed to
better evaluate sentence comprehension in dyslexia.
SPOKEN SENTENCE COMPREHENSION IN CHILDREN WITH SLI

One way to evaluate spoken sentence comprehension difficulties in children with
dyslexia is to directly compare their performance to that of children with a
frank LI. Children with SLI characteristically show impaired spoken sentence
comprehension. As in the dyslexia literature, there is some debate concerning the nature of these deficits and whether they represent a syntactic deficit
versus verbal WM limitations (Montgomery, 1995; van der Lely & Harris,
1990). Children with SLI have poor syntactic skills in both sentence comprehension and sentence production (Johnston & Kamhi, 1984; van der Lely, 1996;
van der Lely & Harris, 1990; van der Lely & Stollwerck, 1997). For instance,
the TROG (Bishop, 1989) is commonly used for SLI classification (Bishop
et al., 1999; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Montgomery, 1995; Norbury, Bishop,
& Briscoe, 2001), and it measures children's ability to process a wide range of
increasingly complex syntactic information.
Children with SLI tend to have the most difficulty with sentences that use
complex word order. For instance, a canonical sentence that follows a typical

Applied Psycholinguistics 31:1

146

word order, in which the subject precedes the object, tends to be less of a problem
for children with SLI (e.g., The man is pointing at the boy) than noncanonical
sentences that follow atypical word order, such that the object precedes the subject
(e.g., The boy is pointed at by the man; van der Lely, 1994, 1996; van der Lely &
Harris, 1990). Van der Lely and colleagues suggest that sentence comprehension
deficits in children with SLI are only evident when they must employ knowledge of
syntactic constraints and cannot depend on semantics or pragmatics. For example,
children with SLI can use context to help parse the sentence, The mouse is chased
by the cat, because this sentence reflects a typical situation, whereas the reverse
is less likely to be true. According to van der Lely, this suggests poor sentence
comprehension in children with SLI is grounded in an underlying syntactic deficit
(van der Lely, 1994, 1996; van der Lely & Harris, 1990; van der Lely & Stollwerck,
1997).
COULD A PHONOLOGICAL DEFICIT INFLUENCE SENTENCE
COMPREHENSION IN SLI?

As mentioned earlier, spoken sentence comprehension involves both the storage
and processing of verbal material, and so it is possible that impairment in phonological STM could explain sentence comprehension difficulties. In keeping with
this, there is a great deal of evidence that children with SLI have phonological STM
deficits (Archibald & Gathercole, 2006; Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996; Botting
& Conti-Ramsden, 2001; de Bree et al., 2007; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998;
Gathercole and Baddeley, 1990); indeed, such difficulties have been argued to be a
diagnostic marker of the disorder (Bishop et al., 1996; Conti-Ramsden, Botting, &
Faragher, 2001). Because spoken sentence comprehension requires phonological
STM, it seems important to examine the relationship between syntactic processing
and verbal WM in children with SLI.
Montgomery (1995) examined the relationship between phonological STM
and syntax in children with SLI. In this study, children with SLI showed poorer
performance on a spoken-sentence-picture matching task compared to younger
control children matched on language level. Notably, however, group differences
were only observed for long sentences (e.g., The girl who is smiling is pushing
the boy); there was no group difference on short sentences (The girl smiling is
pushing the boy). In the same study there was also a significant correlation between
phonological STM measured by nonword repetition and overall performance on
the sentence comprehension task. Montgomery concluded that poor phonological
STM in children with SLI impairs their sentence comprehension when sentences
are long, because there is more verbal material to store when processing longer
sentences. On the other hand, the sentences used in the Montgomery study were
typically active voice sentences rather than passives or object relatives generally
used to detect deficits in SLI (e.g., The boy is pushed by the girl who is smiling;
This is the boy who is pushed by the girl who is smiling). Although these sentences
offer a manipulation of WM demands, they do not clearly manipulate syntactic
difficulty. In this respect, the sentences may not have been sensitive enough to
reveal a syntactic deficit in SLI.

THE CURRENT STUDY

Overall, the severity and nature of syntax deficits in dyslexia are unclear. One way
to evaluate this issue is to compare children with dyslexia to control children and
to a group of children with LI, who are well known for sentence comprehension
deficits but whose deficit is also controversial with respect to the influence of
verbal WM on syntactic processing. The current study also sought to examine the
contribution of syntactic complexity and verbal WM demands during sentence
comprehension. Of interest was performance on canonical versus noncanonical sentences, which helped to determine if children had specific problems with
processing a sentence's syntactic form. Sentence production and comprehension
entails a broad range of syntactic operations, and consequently, various syntactic
structures have been used as manipulations across studies of LI and dyslexia, for
instance, subject-verb agreement and constructions with subject or object-relative
embedded clauses (Mann et al., 1984; Montgomery, 1995; Rispens & Been, 2007;
Rispens et al., 2004; Shankweiler et al. 1995). The word order manipulation
used here builds on prior studies finding that children with LI have well-known
difficulties in processing the noncanonical form in English, and therefore represent
a useful starting point for comparing sentence comprehension in dyslexia.
The role of verbal WM in spoken sentence comprehension has also received
attention in both dyslexia and LI studies, although the extent to which sentence
comprehension problems are grounded in syntactic deficits over poor verbal WM is
less clear. The current study examined this more closely by assessing the extent to
which syntactic processing was influenced by verbal WM demands in both reading
and LI. Three different sentence comprehension tests, each with increasing WM
loads, were administered to examine sentence comprehension under increased
storage and processing demands. The different WM loads were based on the
delay between the presentation of the spoken sentence and the picture context. In
addition, we employed a sentence-length manipulation, whereby each WM load
contained both short and long sentences. The short and long sentences were similar
in overall structure, but the long sentences contained additional detail in relation
to either the subject or object, which was necessary for accurate interpretation of
the sentence. The longer sentences were expected to place heavier demands on
phonological STM (and ultimately verbal WM) than the shorter sentences. Finally,
a separate measure of phonological STM, nonword repetition, was employed to
assess phonological storage in both reading and LI, allowing us to examine whether
the two groups differed in this respect.
In summary, the current study evaluates spoken sentence comprehension in
dyslexia by comparing them to children with LI, and to same-age and younger
control children. Moreover, we examine whether syntactic processing problems
(marked by poorer performance on noncanonical compared to canonical sentences) in dyslexia are only observed when verbal WM demands are high. The
relationship between syntax deficits and verbal WM problems in oral LIs is somewhat more exploratory. Children with LI have characteristic syntax deficits, often
in the absence of apparently high WM demands; but there is growing evidence
that phonological STM deficits are common in these children, which could, in
turn, influence syntactic processing. The current study measured how syntactic

processing in language-impaired children is influenced by increasing verbal WM
demands and whether this pattern is similar or different to what is observed in
dyslexia. Finally, we will also investigate whether a significant relationship exists
between children's phonological STM, measured by nonword repetition, and sentence comprehension accuracy and whether this relationship becomes stronger as
the WM loads during sentence comprehension increase.
METHOD

Procedures were approved by the University of Western Ontario Nonmedical Research Ethics Board. Measures were administered in two separate sessions, with a
fixed order across all participants. Each of the testing sessions lasted 30-45 min.
The first session was completed in local schools, and included the standardized
reading, receptive grammar, vocabulary, and nonverbal IQ tests described below.
The second session took place in the Language, Reading, and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario and included the sentence
comprehension tasks and phonological STM task. A short break was given halfway
through the laboratory session. Children received a small gift (books, colored
pencils) to thank them for participating.
Participants

A total of 56 children were recruited from London, Ontario, area schools, where
they were enrolled in first to fifth grade classes. Inclusion in the present study was
based on standard tests of language, reading, and cognitive achievement described
below. Children were excluded if they did not speak English as a first language,
if they had a frank neurological disorder, pervasive developmental deficits, or
significant hearing impairment (based on parental report), or if they had an average
scaled score lower than 7 or higher than 13 on block design and picture completion
subtasks of either Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition (WISCIII; n = 46; Wechsler, 1992) or WISC-IV (n = 10; Wechsler, 2003).
Participant groups are described in Table 1. Classification into each group was
based on performance on standardized tests of reading and receptive language.
Reading ability was assessed using the word identification and word attack subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests--Revised (WRMT-R; Woodcock,
1989). These tests involve reading common words or nonwords aloud. Receptive
grammar was assessed using the TROG (Bishop, 1989). This is a broad measure of
receptive language abilities including morphological and syntactic relationships,
and involves listening to sentences and pointing to one of four pictures that corresponds to that sentence. Receptive vocabulary was measured using the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test, Third Edition (PPVT; Dunn & Dunn, 1997), and involves
listening to words and pointing to one of four pictures corresponding to that
word.
The dyslexic group consisted of 14 children (M = 10 years, 6 months [10;6])
who scored below the 15th percentile rank on word identification, but who had
standard scores above 87 on the TROG as well as normal-range nonverbal IQ.
This scheme is consistent with how previous studies have classified dyslexia as

Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Montgomery, 1995; Norbury et al., 2001), as they

test. Notably, we did not preclude children from the LI group based on concomitant reading impairments, given that doing so would have significantly limited
the sample size and likely make the sample less comparable to previous studies (Catts et al., 2005; Goulandris, Snowling, & Walker, 2000; Joanisse et al.,
2000; McArthur et al., 2000; Snowling, Bishop, & Stothard, 2000). As a result,
4 of the 14 children in the LI group met the classification criteria for dyslexia,
marked by a percentile rank below 15 on the Word Identification subtest of the
WRMT-R.
Both control groups consisted of children who scored in normal ranges on
reading and receptive language tests (40th-60th percentile on word identification
and a standard score above 90 on TROG), and with average performance IQ
standard scores between 7 and 13. The CA group consisted of 14 children matched
for age with the LI and dyslexic groups, t (26) = .817, ns; t (26) = 1.42, ns,
respectively. The reading and language (RL) control group consisted of 14 children
who were on average 2 years younger (M = 8;0) than the LI, t (26) = 6.21, p < .001;
dyslexic, t (26) = 6.63, p < .001; and CA control children, t (26) = 5.14, p < .001.
The RL control group was also matched to the dyslexic group with respect to
WRMT word identification, t (26) = 0.526, p = .603; and word attack scores,
t (26) = 0.055, p = .956. The RL control group was also matched to the LI group
with respect to PPVT receptive vocabulary raw scores, t (26) = 0.503, p = .619.
Sentence comprehension
Stimuli. In each of the three sentence comprehension tests (WM Loads 1, 2,

and 3), there were a total of 24 spoken sentences used to measure sentence
comprehension. There were 12 canonical sentences with 6 actives and 6 subject
relatives collapsed and 12 noncanonical sentences with 6 passives and 6 object
relatives collapsed. Sentence length was varied by adding adjectival information
(e.g., The man is pointed at by the boy, became The man in the dark grey shirt
is pointed at by the boy in the bright red pants). For each test, there were 4
short canonical, 4 short noncanonical, 8 long canonical, and 8 long noncanonical
sentences. A larger number of long sentences were used to make the test more
sensitive to reveal syntax problems. See Appendix A for the items used in the
study.
Each spoken sentence was matched to four possible pictures: one target and three
distractors. In all sentences, the action was held constant across the four pictures,
and in long sentences the two characters involved were also constant. For the
long sentences, there was a syntax distractor in which the subject and object were
reversed, an adjective distractor in which the syntactic properties were correct, but
the adjective qualifying the subject or object was changed (e.g., blue pants instead
of red pants), and finally a syntax + adjective distractor in which both the word
order and adjective were incorrect (Appendix B, Fig. B.1). The short sentence trials
also contained a syntactic distractor, like the long sentences. Because the short
sentences did not have adjectives describing the subject and object, the structure
of two of the distractors were different in theses trials; one involved a character
that was the incorrect subject, and the second involved an incorrect object and
subject (Appendix B, Fig. B.2).

Procedures. Sentences were presented binaurally via headphones in a sound-

attenuated booth on a PC desktop computer (children were asked to set the volume to a comfortable level during the practice trials), in random order. Children
were instructed to point to the picture that depicted the sentence they heard. The
experimenter coded responses by pressing the appropriate key. Children were told
before the test trials that they could only hear the sentence one time and that they
should listen carefully. If a child asked the experimenter to repeat the sentence
during the test trials, it was coded as incorrect (for the purpose of error analyses,
these were coded as "repetition" errors).
Children were tested on three different sentence comprehension tests, with
increasing WM loads in each. Each WM load had four practice trials, presented
with feedback. In WM Load 1, children viewed the four pictures on a computer
screen while listening to the sentence; the pictures were presented for 2000 ms
before the onset of the sentence, and remained on the screen for the entire duration
of the sentence. In WM Load 2, memory load was increased by presenting the
entire sentence before the picture array appeared (0-ms delay). In WM Load 3,
there was a 3000-ms delay between the offset of the sentence and the pictures
stimuli, which was intended to further increase WM demands. One CA control
participant declined participation in the WM Load 3 test.
Phonological STM

Phonological STM was tested using the nonword repetition subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999),
which required children to listen to and repeat nonsense words presented on tape.
The items ranged from monosyllabic nonwords to nonwords with seven syllables. An item was marked as incorrect if one phoneme was repeated incorrectly.
The stop rule in this test was to discontinue if a child failed three consecutive
items.
RESULTS

A series of one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were first conducted to
verify group differences on the classification measures (Table 2). In the first
set, the CA control group was compared to the dyslexic and LI groups, and
significant group effects were followed with Tukey post hoc comparisons. A
second set of ANOVAs was conducted to examine differences between the RL
control, dyslexic, and LI groups. Two sets of ANOVAs were conducted for each
control group because we intended first to examine whether children with dyslexia
and/or LI showed impairments relative to the age-matched controls, and second,
whether their performance was similar or different to younger controls. Raw scores
were used throughout, because these are more appropriate for comparing overall
performance in the younger control group to that of the dyslexic and LI groups
(Table 1).
Comparisons of the LI, dyslexic and CA control groups showed an effect for
word identification raw scores. The dyslexic and LI groups scored significantly
lower than the CA control group ( p < .001 and p < .05, respectively) but did not

post hoc tests showing both the dyslexic and LI groups had lower scores the CA
control group ( p < .001 and p < .05, respectively), but did not differ from each
other (ns). For TROG raw scores, we observed a significant group effect, and lower
scores in the LI group compared to both the CA control group and the dyslexic
group ( p < .001 for both); the dyslexic group also had significantly lower scores
than the CA control group ( p < .05). In contrast, no effect was found for PPVT
raw scores or WISC scaled scores.
The second set of ANOVAs examined group differences between the RL control,
dyslexic, and LI groups. In this case there were no significant group effects on
either the word identification or word attack raw scores. There was a significant
group effect on TROG, with post hoc tests revealing lower scores in the LI group
compared to the RL control group ( p < .01). There were no group differences on
PPVT raw scores or average WISC scores.
We also examined group differences on the nonword repetition test. The first
analysis examined the dyslexic, LI, and CA control groups, and revealed a
marginally significant group effect. Planned comparison two-tailed independent t
tests revealed that the CA control group had higher scores than the dyslexic, t (26) =
2.35, p < .05, and LI groups, t (26) = 2.29, p < .05, which did not differ from each
other, t (26) = 0.28, ns. No effect was found for a similar ANOVA comparing the
dyslexic, LI, and CA control groups.

Sentence comprehension accuracy

The group means for each sentence comprehension test (WM Loads 1, 2, and 3)
are provided in Table 3. Means are illustrated for overall performance, as well as
performance on each sentence type. Mixed ANOVAs were conducted to examine
effects of group, sentence type (canonical vs. noncanonical), and length (short
vs. long) separately for each WM load. Significant main effects of group were
followed with Tukey post hoc comparisons. Interactions were followed up with
planned comparisons (paired t tests). In the first set of ANOVAs, the CA control
group was compared to the dyslexic and LI groups. The second set compared the
RL control, dyslexic, and LI groups.

The results of the CA control group mixed ANOVAs for the three WM loads
are illustrated in Table 4. In WM Load 1, there was a significant main effect
of group and Tukey post hoc tests revealed that the LI group had lower scores
than the CA control group ( p < .01) and the dyslexic group ( p < .05), and there
were no differences between the CA control and dyslexic groups (ns). There
were also significant main effects of sentence type and length. The significant
Group x Sentence Type interaction was followed up by separately examining
mean scores within groups. Planned comparisons revealed that only the LI group
performed more poorly on noncanonical sentences compared to canonical sentences, t (13) = 2.02, p < .05; the CA, t (13) = 0.49, ns, and dyslexic groups,
t (13) = 0.61, ns, did not differ on the two sentence types. No other interactions
were significant.
In WM Load 2, there was a significant main effect of group, and Tukey post
hoc tests revealed that the LI group had lower scores than the CA control group
and the dyslexic group ( p < .05 for both), and there were no differences between
the CA control group and the dyslexic group (ns). There were also significant
main effects of sentence type and length. There was a significant interaction
between sentence type and length. Planned comparisons revealed the effect of
sentence type was stronger in long sentences, t (41) = 7.77, p < .001, compared to short sentences, t (41) = 2.13, p < .05. No other interactions were
significant.
In WM Load 3, there was a significant main effect of group, and Tukey post
hoc tests revealed that the LI group had lower scores than the CA control group
and the dyslexic group ( p < .01 and p < .05, respectively), and there were no

differences between the CA control group and the dyslexic group (ns). There
were also significant main effects of sentence type and length. There was a
marginally significant interaction between group and sentence type. Planned comparison paired t tests conducted in each group separately revealed that both the LI,
t (13) = 3.45, p < .01, and dyslexic groups, t (13) = 2.12, p < .05, showed poorer
performance on noncanonical sentences compared to canonical sentences, but the
CA control group showed no difference between the two sentence types, t (12) =
0.44, ns. No other interactions were significant.
A second set of ANOVAs was conducted to examine group differences among
the LI, dyslexic, and RL control group in each of the three WM loads (Table 5). In
WM Load 1, the main effect of group was not significant. There were significant
main effects of sentence type and length, and there were no significant interactions.
In WM Load 2, there was a significant main effect of group. However, Tukey
post hoc tests revealed again that the LI group performed more poorly than the
dyslexic group ( p < .05), and the RL control group did not differ from either the
LI or dyslexic groups (ns for both). Again, there were significant main effects of
sentence type and length. There was a significant interaction between sentence
type and length. Planned comparisons revealed the effect of sentence type was
stronger in long sentences, t (41) = 7.47, p < .001, compared to short sentences,
t (41) = 2.30, p < .05. No other interactions were significant.
In WM Load 3, there was a significant main effect of group. However, Tukey
post hoc tests again revealed that the LI group only performed more poorly than
the dyslexic group ( p < .05) and the RL control group did not differ from either
the LI or dyslexic groups (ns for both). There were significant main effects of
sentence type and length and a significant interaction between sentence type and

length. Planned comparisons revealed there was an effect of sentence type in long
sentences, t (41) = 5.21, p < .01, but not in short sentences, t (41) = 1.96, ns. No
other interactions were significant.
Correlations between nonword repetition and sentence comprehension

We also examined the relationship between phonological STM and sentence comprehension performance. We computed bivariate Pearson correlations between
raw nonword repetition scores and overall accuracy in each of the three WM
loads, across all participants in all groups. Significant correlations were observed
for Loads 2 and 3, but not for Load 1 (WM Load 1: r = .25, ns; WM Load 2: r =
.29, p < .05; WM Load 3: r = .28, p < .05). The same pattern of results were obtained when we employed the nonparametric Spearman correlations (WM Load
1: r = .168, ns; WM Load 2: r = .205, p < .05; WM Load 3: r = .208, p < .05).
Distribution of sentence comprehension errors

We next examined the types of errors observed in each group. Analyses were
restricted to long noncanonical sentences collapsed across WM Loads 2 and 3
(WM Load 1 was excluded because of the very small error rates in the control
and dyslexic groups in those trials). We focused on long sentences to take advantage of a critical structural differences among the distractors: these sentences
contained relevant adjectival information (e.g., man in the grey shirt vs. man
in the brown shirt) and as such errors could be based on a failure to process
only propositional information (e.g., the identity of the agent or patient of a
sentence), syntactic information (the reversal of the subject and object), or the
combination of the two (see Appendix B, Fig. B.1). In contrast, distractors in the
short sentences were structurally different in this respect, and thus errors on these
items were less informative about children's response strategies (see Appendix B,
Fig. B.2).
A nonparametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test was conducted within each group
to determine whether children made more syntax errors than adjective errors.
This test compared the number of participants who made more syntax errors than
adjective errors to the number of participants who made more adjective errors than
syntax errors. A greater number of syntax versus adjective errors would indicate
that difficulty in sentence processing is grounded in syntactic processing above and
beyond storage demands. If there were no such differences between the number
of syntax and adjective errors, this would suggest that sentence processing was
affected by storage demands.
Error data are listed in Table 6. Notably, the majority of errors across all
participants were either syntactic or adjective (39.44% and 49.81%, respectively)
and few syntax plus adjective or repetition errors were made (10.44% and 1.31%,
respectively). The LI group showed a marginally significant effect (z = 1.93, p =
.053), marked by a greater number of children showing more syntax errors
than adjective errors than vice versa. No significant effects were found for the
dyslexic (z = 0.55, ns), CA control (z = 0.91, ns), and RL control (z = 0.53, ns)
groups.

DISCUSSION

The goal of this study was to examine the extent and the nature of sentence
comprehension deficits in dyslexia by comparing them to what is observed in
children with LI. A sentence-picture matching task was used in which sentence
type was manipulated by using canonical versus noncanonical word order, and
sentence length was manipulated by using short and long sentences. Sentence
comprehension was tested under three different WM loads, by varying the delay between the presentation of the sentence and the pictures. Evidence for the
presence of syntax deficits in dyslexia has been equivocal in previous studies.
The current study addressed the ambiguity in a number of ways. We compared
sentence comprehension in the dyslexic group not only to that of control children
but also to children with LI, who show characteristic syntax deficits. In addition,
we employed clear manipulations of syntactic difficulty and verbal WM to evaluate
the extent to which sentence comprehension problems in dyslexia and LI were
grounded in syntactic processing over verbal WM limitations.
In WM Load 1, pictures and the spoken sentences were presented simultaneously. This allowed children to refer to different pictures as they heard the
sentence. In this case, we failed to observe appreciable sentence comprehension
difficulties in the dyslexic group, regardless of syntactic complexity or length. In
contrast, the LI group showed impaired performance on this task, marked by lower
scores compared to both the CA control and dyslexic groups. In particular, they
showed specific difficulty processing noncanonical sentences, suggesting their
deficit was localized to processing the form of sentences. This was not surprising,
given that classification of LI was based on extremely poor performance on a
comprehension test of morphosyntax. In addition, numerous other studies have
observed similar difficulties in language-impaired children (van der Lely, 1994,
1996; van der Lely & Harris, 1990). Notwithstanding, few studies have examined
how verbal WM interacts with syntactic processing in SLI, despite the two large
bodies of literature on syntax deficits and phonological STM deficits in this group.
Our study indicates that language-impaired children show syntax deficits even
when verbal WM is minimized.
In WM Load 2, we manipulated the delay between the auditory sentence and
the onset of the visual probe. The manipulation builds on the observation in some
studies that sentence comprehension difficulties in dyslexia will tend to be more
pronounced in the case of stronger WM constraints (e.g., Mann et al., 1984;

Applied Psycholinguistics 31:1

158

Rispens et al., 2004) compared to others that have not (e.g., Shankweiler et al.,
1995). In this case, children in all groups showed a decrement in performance,
especially on the noncanonical sentences. This pattern suggested that syntactic
processing difficulties can be induced by increasing storage and processing demands, similar to what has been shown in prior studies of adults and children
(Dick et al., 2001; Leech, Aydelott, Symons, Carnevale, & Dick, 2007).
When WM demands were further increased by placing a 3-s delay between
the spoken sentence and the pictures (WM Load 3), a somewhat different pattern emerged. The LI, dyslexic, and RL control groups showed poorer performance on noncanonical compared to canonical sentences; however, this effect
was not apparent in the CA control group. Overall, our pattern of results is similar to the pattern observed by Rispens and Been (2007); we observed that the
dyslexic group showed better syntactic processing than the LI group. Moreover,
we have some evidence that syntactic processing in the dyslexic group was more
influenced by verbal WM demands than what was shown in the CA control
group.
One explanation for why the CA control group was less influenced by syntactic
complexity in the longest delay test is that these children were actually using
the additional time to rehearse the spoken sentence before responding, which
facilitated processing. Because the CA control group had generally higher phonological STM scores compared to the other groups, it seems possible that they were
using their strong storage skills during these 3 s. In this respect, the shorter delay
(WM Load 2) may not have provided enough time even for control children to
rehearse the material. In contrast, the dyslexic, LI, and RL control groups all had
similar phonological STM scores, and these three groups also performed more
poorly on noncanonical sentences, compared to canonical sentences, in the 3-s
delay condition. The CA control group's stronger storage could have facilitated
the syntactic parsing of the utterance during the 3-s delay.
Although the dyslexic and CA control groups did not differ significantly on
overall accuracy in WM Load 3, the dyslexic group did show an effect of sentence type whereas the CA control group did not. This points to the possibility
that dyslexic children's syntactic processing was more likely to be influenced by
verbal WM demands than their same-age peers. This seems consistent with earlier findings of sentence comprehension difficulties in dyslexia, especially under
tasks that appear to impose greater WM loads (Mann et al., 1984; Shankweiler
et al., 1984). For instance, in the Shankweiler et al. (1984) study, children were
asked to first listen to a sentence and then manipulate objects in accordance
with it. Note that other studies (e.g., Shankweiler et al., 1995), have failed to
find a syntactic deficit in dyslexia, although in those cases children made judgments for auditory sentences concurrently with the exact pictorial representation
among distractor pictures, similar to what was done in WM Load 1 in the present
study.
The present study also manipulated the length of sentences. This did have an
effect on overall comprehension of the sentence, such that long sentences were
consistently harder to process than short sentences. Notably, there was also evidence that length interacted with syntactic complexity, such that only noncanonical

sentences were more difficult to process in the long versus short condition. The
longer sentences not only contained more words than the shorter sentences, but the
extra words contained important adjectival information that needed to be encoded
to correctly interpret the target. These heavier storage demands influenced sentence
comprehension in all groups of children. However, the length manipulation did
not interact with group in any of the three WM loads, suggesting that it influenced
children from all groups equally. This pattern is different from what Montgomery
(1995) observed in an earlier study; length influenced sentence comprehension accuracy in SLI, but not in controls. However, the syntactic and length manipulations
in the current study appeared to be more difficult than those in the Montgomery
study, and perhaps more sensitive to changes in sentence comprehension accuracy
even in typically developing children.
The distribution of syntactic versus adjective errors in the long noncanonical sentences also revealed interesting differences across groups. We observed
important differences in how children in the LI group were performing on this
task, compared to the dyslexic and control groups. Specifically, language-impaired
children were more likely to commit syntactic reversal errors (e.g., reversing the
subject and object of a sentence), which suggests that they had difficulty representing or maintaining the configural aspects of a sentence. We interpret this error
pattern as evidence that these children tend to fall back on the default English
subject-verb-object word order as sentence complexity increases. However, it
is also possible that they were trying to represent both the adjectives and word
order correctly, but that word order was more difficult for them and resulted in a
greater number of errors. In contrast, children in the control and dyslexic groups
showed a more even distribution of syntactic and adjective errors. This suggests
they recognized that both adjective and word order information were critical to
the task, especially for the long sentences. If these children aimed to correctly
represent both the sentence's propositional and syntactic forms, it is reasonable to
assume that they would make errors on both types of information.
The younger control group had similar reading levels as the dyslexic group
and similar vocabulary levels as the LI group. The purpose of this group was to
help determine whether any observed syntactic processing difficulties were based
on a delay that could potentially be explained by limited reading and vocabulary
experience. The dyslexic and LI groups tended to score at about the same level as
the RL controls, raising the possibility that sentence comprehension performance
might be influenced by experience. However, the LI group showed proportionately
more syntax-level errors compared to the RL control group, suggesting this may
be a key difference between the dyslexic and LI groups.
The present data suggest it may also be interesting to compare languageimpaired children with younger controls scoring similarly on tests of grammatical
ability. Such a design would allow us to more fully assess whether the error patterns
observed in the LI group represent a point of departure from the typical developmental pattern. Likewise, this study only examined sentence comprehension with
respect to a word order manipulation. It remains an open question whether observed differences between dyslexic, language-impaired, and typically developing
children will persist with respect to other types of syntactic manipulations as well.

Can STM or WM explain sentence comprehension deficits?

Phonological STM, measured with nonword repetition, was significantly correlated with sentence comprehension accuracy. The data suggest that accurate
storage of phonological information contributes to how children understand auditory sentences, in particular, when processing demands are increased. On one
account, phonological STM is a subsystem of WM that acts as a slave module
for a central executive system responsible for actual processing (Baddeley, 1981);
however, other views see storage and processing as more closely related, such that
phonological STM capacity plays a more central role in actual WM for sentence
processing (Just & Carpenter, 1992).
The present data also reflect the fact that spoken sentence comprehension ultimately requires processing beyond the storage of verbal material. Although
phonological STM did correlate with sentence comprehension, not all children
with poor STM scores scored equally poorly on sentence comprehension. Even
though both the dyslexic and LI groups showed deficits on nonword repetition, the LI group showed much more severe sentence comprehension difficulties. Thus, STM alone cannot account for the syntactic difficulties we observed
here.
There are two possible explanations. The first is that the occurrence of an STM
and sentence comprehension deficit in SLI is purely coincidental, such that the
two are not closely related (Bishop, Adams, & Norbury, 2006; van der Lely &
Harris, 1990). On this view, it is argued that language-impaired children showed a
qualitatively different pattern of performance given that they were the only group
that showed a specific difficulty in the minimal WM load condition, and the only
group that tended to make errors primarily based on syntax. The alternative is that
the locus of the impairment in SLI is one of verbal WM, which incorporates both
storage and processing, rather than being localized to STM (i.e., storage only). On
this theory, language-impaired children have difficulty with syntactic processing
because of a limitation in the ability to manipulate verbal information as it is
held in a short-term store (Gathercole & Baddeley 1990; Montgomery, 1995). The
results of the present study seem consistent with this. Children with LI did show
a decrement in processing sentences as WM load was increased; likewise, the
dyslexic and control children showed an LI-like pattern of deficit when a load was
imposed. This is also consistent with the theory that WM limitations tend to impact
sentence processing, especially as it relates to structurally complex sentences (Just
& Carpenter, 1992; MacDonald & Christiansen, 2002).
CONCLUSION

The purpose of this study was to examine the extent and the nature of sentence
comprehension deficits in dyslexia by comparing them to children with LI. Of
interest, we observed different patterns of impairment in the two groups. Overall,
the dyslexic group showed better sentence comprehension than the LI group.
However, there was also evidence that syntactic processing problems under demanding verbal WM loads were more pronounced in dyslexia and LI than in
same-age control children. In addition, both dyslexic and LI groups showed poor

phonological STM outside the domain of sentence comprehension. The finding
that phonological STM was significantly correlated with sentence comprehension accuracy under demanding storage and processing conditions suggests good
storage skills facilitate spoken sentence comprehension, and that this may be why
sentence comprehension was mildly impaired in dyslexia. In contrast, the LI group
showed significant difficulty with syntactic processing even when WM load was
minimized. These results support the idea that nonphonological language processing is generally better in children with dyslexia than in children with oral LIs
(Bishop & Snowling, 2004). However, they also suggest that syntactic processing
in all children can be influenced by task demands and by individual differences
in phonological STM capacity. Thus, the data suggest that both dyslexic and
language-impaired children are susceptible to difficulties in syntactic processing,
and although the groups clearly differed in terms of degree of impairment, increased WM load does tend to draw out difficulties that were not apparent when
WM load is minimized.
