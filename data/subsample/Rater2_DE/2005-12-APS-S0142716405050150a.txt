ABSTRACT
The effectiveness of a high variability identification training procedure to improve native Japanese
identification and production of the American English (AE) mid and low vowels /ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/,
/C/ was investigated. Vowel identification and production performance for two groups of Japanese
participants was measured before and after a 6-week identification training period. Recordings were
made of both group's pre-/posttraining vowel productions of the five vowels, which were evaluated by a
group of native AE listeners using a five-alternative, forced-choice identification task and by an acoustic
analysis of the vowel productions. The overall results confirmed that the identification performance
of the experimental (trained) participants improved after identification training with feedback and that
the training also had a positive effect on their production of the target AE vowels.

When learning a second or foreign language (L2), adults typically have difficulty mastering certain phonemic contrasts in the target language (Best, 1995;
MacKain, Best, & Strange, 1981). As language-specific perceivers, adults' perception of speech is attuned to contrastive elements that serve to distinguish native
phones during first or native language (L1) acquisition. It can be a challenge for
listeners to accurately distinguish between sounds in the L2, or between L1 and

L2 sounds. Nonnative sounds tend to be perceived and produced according to the
acoustic patterns of L1 categories (Best 1995; Flege, 1988), which can result in
the mispronunciation of particular phones in the L2 (Flege, 1989; Major, 1987;
Strange & Jenkins, 1978).
Prior studies examining the effects of auditory training on L2 speech acquisition have focused on nonnative consonant contrasts using a discrimination format
(differentiating between two or more stimuli) and/or identification format (assigning labels to individual stimuli; Bradlow, Pisoni, Akahane-Yamada, & Tohkura,
1997; Flege, 1989, 1995b; Jamieson & Morosan, 1986; Lively, Logan, & Pisoni,
1993; Logan, Lively, & Pisoni, 1991; Pisoni, Lively, & Logan, 1994; Strange &
Dittman, 1984). Most studies show improvement in perception with the amount
of improvement depending upon several factors, including the characteristics of
the learners, the relationship of the L1 to the L2, the nature and range of the L1
stimuli, as well as the training methods being employed and use or nonuse of
variability in the stimuli.
Strange and Dittmann (1984) incorporated a same-different discrimination task
using a synthesized "rock"-"lock" continuum in an attempt to improve native
Japanese perception of the /r/-/l/ contrast. They wanted to see if what listeners
learned in discrimination training transferred to a different kind of task, and if
training with only a small number of synthetic stimuli that contained the target
sounds in only initial position would help listeners form phonetic categories of
/r/ and /l/ in other consonant positions. The training effectiveness was assessed
using a pre-/posttest design containing natural speech stimuli in which pretest
levels of performance were compared with performance after training. Although
the results showed gradual improvement in performance for subjects for the 14-18
sessions, there was no indication of transfer of learning to the natural speech words
contrasting /r/ and /l/ used in the posttest. One reason for the failure of Strange and
Dittmann's discrimination training procedure was its lack of stimulus variability
and utilization of low-level, sensory-based information in the speech signal, which
focuses on tapping into short-term sensory memory.
Logan et al. (1991) utilized a two-alternative, forced-choice identification
(2AFC) task that incorporated a variable stimuli procedure with feedback to train
Japanese in the American English (AE) /r/-/l/ contrast. Minimal pairs were used
contrasting /r/ and /l/ in a varied environment and with multiple speakers. A pre-/
posttest design containing natural tokens was used to assess the effects of identification training. Posttest results showed that listeners significantly improved
their identification performance of /r/ and /l/, and that they could generalize to
new contexts (see also Lively et al., 1993). The use of multiple environments and
talkers, along with immediate feedback, in training listeners in the /r/-/l/ contrast
resulted in significant increases in response accuracy from pretest to posttest.
Although prior studies have provided insights into the effects of laboratory
training on L2 speech performance, their focus has been limited to consonants
within a single binary contrast. The present study examined the effectiveness of
identification training on both the identification and production of the five AE
mid- and low vowels /ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, /C/ by native speakers of Japanese. The main
question of interest was, would identification training using a high variability
procedure with natural word stimuli in multiple contexts spoken by multiple
speakers, and including immediate feedback, improve Japanese identification and

production of multiple AE mid and low vowels? We were particularly interested
in furthering our understanding of the effects of auditory training on both the
identification and production of nonnative speech sounds, as there have been no
prior attempts to our knowledge that have examined the effects of identification
training on the identification and production of nonnative vowels. In addition, we
also wanted to focus on multiple vowel sound training (as opposed to a single
binary contrast), which is a more difficult task and closer to the challenge L2
learners face in a naturalistic L2 environment.
A secondary question of interest was, would native Japanese identification
and production performance improve more for some AE mid and low vowels
than others as a result of identification training and would confusions between
vowels be modified in any way as a result of training? These are questions of
interest to L2 speech researchers because there may be implications of the current results for contemporary theories of L2 speech acquisition, such as Best's
(1995) Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) and Flege's (1995a) Speech Learning Model (SLM), especially with regard to the degree of difficulty in the acquisition of nonnative vowels and in predicting L2 speech assimilation patterns
(i.e., how L2 learners categorize nonnative phonemes with respect to phonemes
in their native language). In prior studies examining the assimilation of L2 speech
sounds, a commonly used method with which to quantify the similarity between
two sounds has been to collect listeners' perceptual judgments of L1 and L2
phones. Other methods such as use of acoustic similarity criterion and phonetic
symbols for descriptions of the L1/L2 vowels in question have also been used
(Rochet, 1995).
The number of vowels in English is large in comparison to Japanese. General
AE has 14 or 15 vowels including diphthongs (/i/, / I/, /eI/, //, /ae/, /A/, /O/, /U/, /oU/,
/u/, /2/, /C/, /ai/, /aU/, /OI/). Japanese has two sets of five monophthongal vowels
(/i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, /W/) that contrast long and short (monomoraic or bimoraic), for
example, /ie/ (house) versus /i:e/ (no). Japanese long vowels are 2.4-3.2 times
longer in duration than short vowels (Tsukada, 1999), a much larger ratio than the
differences of long and short vowels in other languages (Lehiste, 1970).
Prior cross-language studies using identification and discrimination tasks to
examine the performance of native Japanese in perceiving L2 vowels have shown
that AE mid and low vowels are difficult for Japanese to distinguish and are
assimilated to L1 vowel categories, which is why we choose the AE mid and
low vowels /ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, and /C/ as the target stimuli of the present study
(see, e.g., Lambacher, Martens, & Molholt, 2000; Strange et al., 1998; Yamada,
Yamada, & Strange, 1995). We were particularly interested in choosing AE vowel
stimuli that would be more of a challenge for native Japanese to develop robust
categories of. Yamada et al. (1995), for example, used both identification and
categorical discrimination tests to examine native Japanese perception of 13 AE
vowels. Confusions among the mid and low vowels //, /ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, and /C/
were very common. Strange et al. (1998) examined the perceptual assimilation of
11 AE vowels by Japanese listeners. Listeners were asked to select the Japanese
vowel category to which each AE vowel was most similar and to rate its category
goodness on a 7-point scale. In general, the pattern of assimilation to the five
Japanese vowels was predictable on the basis of cross-language phonetic similarities. Results showed that low and mid AE vowels were most often assimilated

Applied Psycholinguistics 26:2
Lambacher et al.: Identification training of AE vowels by Japanese

230

to low Japanese vowels and were among the most inconsistently categorized (less
than 75% consistency). In general, AE /2/ and /A/ were most often assimilated
to one- and two-mora Japanese /a/, /ae/ was most often assimilated to singleand two-mora Japanese /a/, and AE /O/ was most often assimilated to Japanese
two-mora /oo/. The rhoticized mid vowel /C/ was not examined by Strange and
colleagues.
The SLM (Flege, 1995a) can help account for the changes that occur during
the acquisition of L2 speech by adults. One hypothesis of the SLM is that the
greater the perceived distance of an L2 vowel from the closest L1 vowel, the
greater likelihood that it will be perceived and produced more accurately and a
new category will be established for it. However, equivalence classification can
occur that link L2 phones with a "similar" L1 category (Flege, 1987).
Because Japanese lacks corresponding vowels for English /ae/ and /C/ in the
front low and mid region of the vowel space, respectively, we predicted that these
two AE vowels would pose less of a problem for the Japanese learners to acquire.
However, the phonetic similarity between AE /A/ and /2/ with Japanese /a/ with
respect to vowel quality (all being unrounded, open mid vowels) suggests that
these two AE vowels might be more challenging for native Japanese to acquire.
We were not exactly sure about the /O/ vowel. Japanese has no comparable vowel
for /O/ in the low back region of the vowel space, however, suggesting that this
sound may be less difficult to acquire for native Japanese.
In the present study, the vowel identification and production performance of two
groups of Japanese participants (an experimental group receiving training between
a pretest and posttest and a control group receiving no training between the two
tests) is measured before and after a 6-week identification-training period. Before
and after the training period, recordings are made of both groups' productions of
a list of words, each containing one of the five AE vowels /ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, and
/C/. These productions are evaluated by a group of 26 native AE listeners in a
five-alternative, forced-choice identification (5AFC) task. In addition, an acoustic
analysis is conducted to examine the first three formant frequencies and vowel
duration measurements of the target AE vowel stimuli as produced by both groups
of Japanese participants and native AE talkers.
EXPERIMENT 1: IDENTIFICATION OF AE VOWELS

Experimental design

The main question addressed in Experiment 1 was whether a highly variable,
identification-training procedure with immediate feedback would have a positive
effect on the experimental group's identification of the target AE vowels. The
vowel identification performance of two groups of Japanese participants was
measured before and after the 6-week identification training period using a 5AFC
identification task. The purpose of the 5AFC identification pre-/posttest task was
to verify if the experimental (trained) group's identification performance improved
more than the control (untrained) group's identification performance on the posttest, which would help to evaluate the effectiveness of the identification training
program.

Method
Participants. Experiment 1 included an experimental group (n = 34) and a con-

trol group (n = 20) of Japanese participants. All of the participants (mean age =
20.2 years) were native speakers of Japanese (all male) from various prefectures
throughout Japan, none of whom had lived abroad in an English-speaking country.
All participants were second-year students majoring in computer science at the
University of Aizu in Fukushima-ken, Japan.1 As is common in Japan, the participants had 6 years of prior English instruction at the junior and senior high school
levels, the focus of which was on English reading and grammar. All participants
reported that they had no history of speech or hearing impediments.

Materials
Pretest/posttest stimuli. The experimental and control participants were pre-

sented a total of 150 tokens (5 vowels x 30 stimuli) in a 5AFC identification
task. In the identification pre-/posttest task, the five AE vowels /ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/,
and /C/ were presented in a varied consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) context
(Table 1). The CVC utterances consisted of all combinations of the three initial
consonants /b/, /m/, /h/ and two final consonants /p/, /d/, for a total of 30 different
CVC contexts.2 These three initial consonants were chosen along with a voiceless
and voiced word-final consonant in order to provide a varied context in which to
present the five target vowels, as prior research has shown that stimuli variability
is necessary to improve L2 speech perception (Logan et al., 1991).
All of the stimuli were recorded by five AE native speakers (all male) with a
mean age of 42.9 years. All of the talkers spoke English with a general American
accent and were able to maintain the /A/-/O/ distinction in their spontaneous speech.
The average period of residence of the 5 AE talkers in Japan was 5 years, but only
one of the AE talkers spoke fluent Japanese.
All of the stimuli in the pre-/posttest identification tasks and training task were
recorded in the same manner. The stimuli were recorded binaurally in a large
anechoic chamber at the University of Aizu. The talker was positioned at ear
level, but slightly off the median plane of the receiver, at an azimuth angle of
approximately 15 and at a distance of 2 m. Synthetic reverberation generated

by the Yamaha REV-500 was added to the dry binaural signal. Listening to these
binaural speech samples via headphones confirmed that this configuration gave a
clearly externalized auditory image. This avoided the rather unnatural sensation
associated with diotic headphone listening (i.e., the same signal presented to both
ears). The samples were recorded at a 48-kHz sampling rate using a Denon model
DTR-80P digital audiorecorder.
The "goodness" (or prototypicality) of the stimuli recorded for all of the identification tasks in Experiment 1 was verified during a preliminary pilot study. Two
native AE speakers (both trained phoneticians) listened via headphones to each
of the stimuli as spoken by the five AE talkers. If a stimulus was regarded as a
poor exemplar of a target vowel it was discarded and a new recording was made
to ensure that each of the tokens was produced as intended.
Procedure for the pretest/posttest

An answer sheet was passed out to each participant to mark his answers. The
answer sheet had 150 rows of five ovals, each row labeled with the five printed
single Roman letters A-E. These letters functioned as responses, and participants
were instructed to give their responses to the 150 stimuli by darkening one of the
five ovals, respectively. Participants chose "A" if they heard /ae/, "B" if they heard
/A/, "C" if they heard /2/, "D" if they heard /O/, and "E" if they heard /C/.
During the pre-/posttest listening tasks, the CVC stimuli were presented to
participants using a Sony TCD-D8 digital audiorecorder at an average presentation
level of 69 dB SPL via Sony HL-90 headphones in a noise-reduced language
laboratory. There was a pause of 5 s between the presentation of each stimulus.
An introduction to the five AE vowels was given to the participants beforehand,
in the form of practice trials. For this purpose a trained phonetician uttered sample
words (all different from those used during any of the listening tasks), containing
one of the five AE vowels. These words were presented orthographically on a
handout that was passed out to each participant as a reminder of which alphabet
letter (A-E) corresponded to which vowel (/ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, /C/).
Stimuli/procedure for training

The identification training task was administered once per week for a total of
6 weeks. During this 6-week training period, the same five AE vowels (/ae/, /A/,
/2/, /O/, /C/) were presented to only the experimental participants in a 5AFC
identification task with CVC stimuli that were not included in the pre-/posttest.
The CVC stimuli were naturally spoken words recorded by the same five AE
talkers. In the training task, the participants heard 75 stimuli (5 speakers x
15 trials), which were presented within a varied CVC context, including two initial
consonants /p/, /t/ and two final consonants /b/, /n/. These particular consonants
were chosen to provide a reasonably balanced phonetic context in which to present
the five target vowels.
During training, immediate feedback was given to participants through their
headphones after each response informing them of the correct answer (either A,
B, C, D, or E) for each stimulus. There was a pause of seven seconds between each
stimulus, and an interval of 5 s between the presentation of each stimulus and the

Results
Pretest and posttest identification performance. The pretest identification re-

sponses of the experimental group were pooled across two variables (consonant
and speaker) to form an overall summary in the form of a confusion matrix
presented in Table 2. The table shows the overall percentage of the total responses
made by the experimental participants for each of the five vowel responses in both
the identification pretest (top of each cell) and posttest (bottom of each cell).
The grand total of the correct pretest responses shows an overall identification
rate of 54%, much higher than chance would allow. In the pretest, confusion was
greatest between the two vowels /A/ and /2/. For example, 31% of /2/ tokens were
heard as /A/, and 22% of /A/ tokens were heard as /2/. In the posttest, confusions
between vowel stimuli decreased overall, except for a number of noteworthy
exceptions: the percentage of /2/ tokens identified as /A/ decreased from 31 to
21%; in contrast, while the overall response rate of /A/ improved in the posttest,
the percentage of /A/ tokens identified as /2/ did not decrease.
Table 3 shows the mean percent correct of identification responses by each of
the two groups of Japanese participants in the pre-/posttest 5AFC identification
task for each of the five AE vowels. To confirm whether or not the improvement

demonstrated by the experimental group in the posttest was due to training or just
simply improvement over time regardless of training, the pre-/posttest identification responses of both groups were submitted to a three-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) in which group (trained vs. untrained) served as a between-subjects
factor, and time of test (pre- vs. post-) and vowel (five levels) served as withinsubject factors. This analysis revealed main effects of group, F (1, 54) = 300.94,
p < .01; time of test, F (1, 54) = 184.08, p < .01; and vowel, F (4, 216) = 58.85,
p < .01.
The two-way interaction between group and time of test that would show the
benefit of training relative to the improvement over time with no training was
significant, F (1, 54) = 45.68, p < .01. Post hoc t tests revealed that the trained
group's improvement from pretest (mean = 54%) to posttest (mean = 70%) was
significant (p < .01). A comparison of posttest identification results showed that
the overall improvement of the trained group (+16%) was significantly greater
than that of the untrained group (+5%, p < .01). In addition, the overall accuracy
of the trained group was greater than that of the untrained group for each of the five
AE vowels, which was confirmed by the significant two-way interaction between
variables group and vowel, F (4, 216) = 11.73, p < .01. For the trained group,
their overall identification scores ranged from a maximum of 75% for all the /C/
stimuli to 52% for all the /A/ stimuli. Their overall correct response rates for the
remaining vowels were /ae/ (64%), /2/ (61%), and /O/ (60%).
The above ANOVA also yielded a significant two-way interaction between
time of test and vowel, F (4, 216) = 7.78, p < .01. A series of post hoc t tests
revealed that the trained group exhibited the greatest improvement in the posttest

in identifying both /C/ and /O/ (+22%) in comparison with the other three vowels
/A/ (+15%), /2/ (+11%), and /ae/ (+10%; p < .01). In contrast, although the
untrained group exhibited varying performance across vowel stimuli, the twoway interaction between time of test and vowel on their performance did not reach
significance (p > .05). Thus, we are able to conclude that the effect of the variables
time of test and vowel on identification performance depended upon whether the
Japanese participants received training or not.
Training task. During the 6-week training period, the five AE vowels were pre-

sented to the experimental participants in a task identical to the pre-/posttest
identification task, except that each of the target vowels were presented in new
CVC words. Another difference was that during training, participants were given
feedback immediately after each individual response regarding the correctness of
their responses.
During the training task, the experimental participants heard a total of 75 CVC
tokens, none of which were used in the pre-/posttest identification task. The
training task was presented once per week for a total of six separate sessions, and
each session took approximately 20 min to complete.
Training results. The identification responses of the experimental participants

during the 6 weeks of training were submitted to a two-way ANOVA in which
week of training (six levels) and vowel (five levels) served as within-subject variables. The ANOVA yielded significant main effects of vowel, F (4, 816) = 19.22,
p < .01, and week, F (5, 170) = 66.80, p < .01. Overall, participants identified
/C/ (mean = 85%), /ae/ (mean = 83%), and /O/ (mean = 83%) more accurately
than the other two vowels /2/ (mean = 79%) and /A/ (mean = 70%; Table 4). A
significant two-way interaction was observed between variables week and vowel,
F (20, 680) = 2.90, p < .01. Throughout the six training sessions, participants
exhibited the greatest cumulative improvement in identifying /A/ (+25%) and /O/
(+23%) compared with the other three vowels /2/ (+18%), /C/ (+16%), and /ae/
(+11%). These results are displayed in Table 4.
A series of post hoc t tests revealed that the participants' identification accuracy
improved each week during the training period, from a mean of 69% in Week 1 to
a mean of 88% in Week 6 (p < .01). They exhibited a slightly greater cumulative
improvement in performance during the first half of identification training period
(+10%) in comparison to the last half (+6%), although the improvement did
not reach significance from Weeks 3 to 4 (p > .05) and from Weeks 5 to 6
(p > .05).
EXPERIMENT 2: EVALUATION OF JAPANESE PRODUCTION
OF AE VOWELS

The main question addressed in Experiment 2 was whether the highly variable,
identification-training procedure with immediate feedback would have a positive
effect on the experimental group's production of the target AE vowels. Several
previous studies have examined the effects of auditory training on the production
of L2 consonants (Bradlow et al., 1997; Rvachew, 1994). Bradlow et al. (1997),
for example, investigated the effects of identification training on production of

English /r/ and /l/ by adult Japanese speakers. The results indicated the training
significantly improved both the identification and production performance of all
Japanese participants. Although these studies have provided insights into the
effects of perceptual training on L2 production performance, their focus was
limited to L2 consonants within a single binary contrast. We were particularly
interested in furthering our understanding of the effects of perceptual training on
L2 production by extending it to multiple nonnative vowels.
Experimental design

Experiment 2 includes three tasks: a production task, a listening task, and analysis
of the spectral and temporal characteristics of the AE vowel stimuli as produced
by the Japanese participants and native talkers. In the production task, the experimental and control participants from Experiment 1 produced words containing
each of the five target AE vowels within a varied CVC context. This task was
performed both before and after the 6-week training period. In the listening task,
a group of 26 native AE speakers served as listeners in a 5AFC identification task
that included a random sampling of the pre-/posttest productions of both groups

Applied Psycholinguistics 26:2

237

of Japanese participants. The purpose of this task was to determine if the AE
listeners could reliably identify each of the five AE vowels as produced by the
experimental participants, which would help to evaluate the transfer of the identification training to their production. Lastly, the first three formant frequencies
and temporal characteristics of the vowel stimuli as produced by both groups of
Japanese participants and the five native AE talkers who recorded the CVC stimuli
for the identification pre-/posttests were analyzed.
Production task stimuli/procedure

The experimental group consisted of a random subset of 20 Japanese participants
from the original experimental group of 34 participants in Experiment 1, and
the control group consisted of all 20 Japanese participants who took part in
Experiment 1. All of the participants recorded CVC words, each containing one of
the five target AE vowels /ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, or /C/. The five vowels were inserted in
/k d/, /k p/, /t d/, and /t k/ frames, yielding 20 minimal pairs. These were words
that the participants had not encountered in any of the previous identification tasks.
The production pretest recordings were carried out before the identification
pretest to avoid the possible effects of exposure to the identification stimuli on
production. An introduction to the production task was given to the participants
beforehand in the form of practice trials. A sheet of paper containing a list of
example CVCs, each containing one of the five target AE vowels printed in
regular Roman orthography, was passed out to the talkers before the experiment.
For the two groups of Japanese participants, a trained phonetician, who was
a native speaker of AE, uttered sample words containing each of the five AE
vowels, so that participants better understood the pronunciation of each of the AE
vowels. However, no explicit instruction in the articulation in any of vowels was
administered.
Both groups of Japanese participants were recorded individually in a soundproof room using a Denon Model DTR-80P digital audiorecorder at a 48-kHz
sampling rate. Each participant read all of the CVC stimuli from a list and was
informed beforehand to produce them with a natural loudness and speaking rate.
The individual recordings were later stored on the hard disk of an SGI workstation
and reproduced using the standard SGI audio hardware. All of the uttererances
were normalized for peak frequency.
Identification of Japanese vowel productions by native AE listeners
Method.
LISTENERS. Twenty-six native speakers of American English (17 female,

9 male) served as listeners. All of the listeners (mean age = 21 years) were
undergraduates majoring in linguistics at West Chester University (West Chester,
PA) who had received training in both phonetics and phonology and were familiar
with IPA transcription. None of the AE listeners reported that they had a history
of speech or hearing impediments.

Stimuli. The pre-/posttest stimuli produced by the experimental and control

groups of Japanese participants were presented in a set of four 5AFC identification
tests to the 26 AE listeners. Productions from a random subset of 20 participants
of the original 34 experimental participants of Experiment 1 and all 20 of the
control subjects of Experiment 1 were included in the 5AFC task. Each test was
comprised of words in mixed consonantal contexts, each word containing one of
the five target vowels, and blocked for each group: that is, the trained participants'
preidentification productions, the trained participants' postidentification productions, the control participants' preidentification productions, and the control participants' postidentification productions. From each of the 40 Japanese participants
(20 per group), a random sampling of 8 out of the 20 vowel stimuli they produced
were chosen for each of the four identification tasks presented to the 26 AE
listeners.
Procedure. The procedure was the same as that of the pre-/postidentification

listening task of Experiment 1 except that the four tests were presented in a
randomized order. In each test, the 26 AE listeners were presented with 160 tokens
(20 talkers x 8 stimuli), and each of the four tests was administered during a
separate class meeting. Each stimulus was presented to the AE listeners at an
average presentation level of 70 dB SPL via Sennheiser HD590 headphones in a
noise-reduced room. In each test, there was a pause of 5 s between the presentation
of each stimulus and a longer pause of 15 s after every 20 items to give the AE
listeners a short break. Each of the four listening tests took approximately 30 min
to complete.
Results
Pre-/posttest identification performance of the AE listeners. The identification

responses of the group of 26 AE listeners obtained in four different testing sessions
were submitted to a threeway ANOVA in which the factor termed group served as
a between-subjects factor (trained vs. untrained participants). Two within-subject
factors were termed time of test (pre- vs. posttraining) and vowel (five stimulus
vowel sounds). Of course, terming the time of test levels as pre versus post refers
to the training that only the experimental group participants received.
The main question addressed in Experiment 2 was whether the identification
training would have a positive effect on the experimental group's vowel productions after their exposure to the training program. Better identification performance by native AE listeners given the experimental group's production would
help support the conclusion that the experimental group's production accuracy of
the five target AE vowels improved as a result of their 6 weeks of identification
training.
The ANOVA yielded significant main effects of group, F (1, 54) = 14.31,
p < .01, test of time, F (1, 54) = 11.42, p < .01, and vowel, F (4, 216) = 138.49,
p < .01. There were significant two-way interactions between variables group
and time of test, F (1, 54) = 14.33, p < .01, and between group and vowel,
F (4, 216) = 2.28, p < .01, as well as a significant three-way Group x Time x
Vowel interaction, F (4, 216) = 6.26, p < .01. Post hoc t tests revealed the

identifiability of the trained group's productions improved from the pretest
(mean = 39%) to posttest (mean = 47%; p < .01), whereas the identifiability
of the control (untrained) group's productions did not increase from pretest
(mean = 36%) to posttest (mean = 35.5%, p = .844).
Table 5 shows a comparison of the mean percentage of correct responses by
the AE listeners of both group's pre-/posttest productions for all five AE vowels,
respectively. Post hoc t tests revealed the two-way interaction between variables
time of test and vowel reached significance for the trained group (p < .01) but not
for the untrained group (p > .05). The AE listeners identified the trained group's
pretest productions of /O/ (mean = 55%), /ae/ (mean = 49%), and /2/ (mean = 47%)
more accurately than the other two vowels /A/ (mean = 25%) and /C/ (mean =
21%). The AE listeners thus showed minimal ability to identify the experimental
group's pretest versions of the /C/ and /A/ stimuli, because random guessing would
lead the listeners to exhibit a 20% correct identification rate. However, the ability
of the AE listeners to identify the trained group's productions of /C/ (+19%)
increased considerably more in the posttest than their ability to identify the other
four vowels /2/ (+11%), /ae/ (+7%), /A/ (+4%), and /O/ (-2%).
Acoustical analysis of AE vowels. To further evaluate the transfer of identifica-

tion training to the experimental group's production, the formant frequencies and
vowel duration measurements of the vowel stimuli, as produced by both groups of
Japanese participants and native AE talkers, were analyzed. We wanted to identify
the acoustic properties of the trained talkers' AE vowel productions that might

240

help to determine whether the perceptual training had a positive effect on their
production.
Method

The first three formant (F1 , F2 , F3 ) frequency and temporal measurements of the
pre-/posttest vowels as produced by the five native AE talkers (all male) who
recorded the vowel stimuli for the identification pre-/posttest and both groups of
Japanese participants (all male) were analyzed using the Praat speech analysis
software (Boersma & Weenink, 2002), and the data were stored using a Toshiba
notebook computer. Mid-vowel F1 , F2 , and F3 formant frequency measurements
from a 50-ms frame at the midpoint within each vowel were taken from the
spectrogram, supplemented by an LPC smoothed spectral display. The smoothed
LPC spectrum was used only to confirm the location of the steady state formant
frequencies estimated by eye from the spectrogram. The duration of each vowel
was measured by hand from dual spectrogram and waveform displays.
Results. The mean values for the frequency of F1 and F2 for each of the AE vow-

els (/ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, /C/) as produced by the experimental and control participants
are shown in Figure 1. The phonetic symbols in the figure indicate the overall
mean values of the five AE vowel categories as produced by the native talkers and
Japanese participants in the pretest and posttest. The area of the ellipses cover the
data points of each target AE vowel as produced in the posttest by the Japanese
participants within each group.
When plotted in an F1 x F2 acoustic space, the experimental group overall
produced the AE vowels in the posttest with substantially less spectral overlap than
did the control group, and closer to the mean values for each of the vowel categories
as produced by the AE talkers. In the posttest, the experimental participants
produced /C/, /ae/, and /O/ with clearly less overlap, indicating they were producing
acoustically distinct vowel quality targets for these three vowels. However, their
posttest productions of /A/ and /2/ revealed a considerable degree of overlap for
these two vowels. The control group, in contrast, produced all five AE vowels in
the posttest with a great deal more spectral overlap.
The mean durations and frequencies of the first three formants of the AE vowels
(/ae/, /A/, /2/, /O/, /C/) as produced by the native AE talkers and both groups of
participants are shown in Table 6. Notice that the mean F3 frequencies of /C/
as produced by the experimental (2393 Hz) and control (2425 Hz) groups were
considerably higher in the pretest in comparison to that of the native AE talkers
(1709 Hz). In the posttest, however, the mean F3 frequency of /C/ as produced
by the experimental group decreased to 2146 Hz, while that of the control group
exhibited no change, suggesting that the trained participants were producing a
more nativelike /C/ after training. A series of t tests revealed that these differences
were significant (p < .01).
The overall temporal results show the native AE talkers and both groups of
Japanese participants produced the /ae/, /A/, /O/, and /C/ vowels with considerably
longer duration than the /2/ vowel (see Table 6). The experimental group, in
particular, produced the /2/ vowel with substantially less duration in the posttest
(125 ms) than in the pretest (157 ms); they also produced a nativelike temporal
difference in the /A/-/2/ contrast in the posttest. A series of t tests revealed that
these durational differences were significant (p < .01).

In terms of vowel quality, therefore, the experimental group's production data
reinforced the identification data reported in Experiment 1 in suggesting that the
/ae/, /C/, and /O/ vowels are easier to distinguish and develop categories of for
native Japanese than the /A/ and /2/ vowels. It also helps to confirm that the
identification training had a positive effect on the experimental group's overall
production performance.
GENERAL DISCUSSION

The main purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the use of a highly variable identification training procedure with immediate feedback would effectively
improve both the identification and production of multiple AE mid and low vowels
by native Japanese. Taken as a whole, the results confirm that the identification
performance of the experimental (trained) participants improved after identification training with feedback. Overall, the training also had a positive effect on their
production of the target AE vowels, even though no explicit articulatory instruction was given about the correct pronunciation of each of the vowels. In contrast,
the control (untrained) participants exhibited a nonsignificant increase in vowel
identification performance, and there was no indication that their production of
the target AE vowels improved. We are thus able to conclude that the effect of the
variables time of test and vowel on the identification and production performance
of the Japanese participants depended upon whether they received training.
These results confirm previous studies' findings that the use of stimulus variability is important when training in nonnative speech contrasts (Jamieson &

Applied Psycholinguistics 26:2
Lambacher et al.: Identification training of AE vowels by Japanese

243

Morosan, 1986; Lively et al., 1993; Logan et al., 1991). Strange and Dittmann's
study, for example, revealed that discrimination training incorporating tokens
from only one context and talker was ineffective in modifying listeners' phonetic perception, especially when generalizing to tokens from other environments. Logan et al. (1991) and Lively et al. (1993), in contrast, used multiple environments and talkers in training listeners in the /r/-/l/ contrast, which
successfully produced significant increases in response accuracy from pretest to
posttest.
A second factor to consider is that during training, feedback was administered
immediately after each trial informing listeners about the correctness of their
responses, which may have helped to accelerate their L2 learning (Logan & Pruitt,
1995). Immediate feedback during training is important because it enables subjects
to consistently attend to the salient acoustic cues of the target stimuli on a trial to
trial basis (Logan et al., 1991; Pisoni, 1977).
A third factor is that the same type of listening task was used during both
training and testing, which is important because it allows for a consistent mapping
by listeners between stimuli and responses throughout different phases of the experiment (Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). An additional task-related factor is listener
motivation, as prior research has indicated that listeners may prefer identification
tasks to other types of training (Flege, 1995b).
We next look at the nature of the learning promoted by the identification training. Did performance improve more for some vowels than others? Was there a
more appropriate use of certain vowel response categories, and were patterns of
confusions between vowel categories modified in any particular way as a result of
training?
The results of the present study showed that the experimental participants exhibited more appropriate use of the /C/, /ae/, and /O/ vowels categories after training,
although their improvement varied across task (identification and production).
The auditory and phonetic distinctness of the AE vowels /C/ (a rounded, closed
mid vowel), /ae/ (a nearly open, low front vowel), and /O/ (a rounded midback
vowel) from the native Japanese /a/ vowel (an unrounded, open, low mid vowel)
may have assisted the experimental participants to become better attuned to the
acoustic representations of these three AE vowels, thus making it easier for them
to establish new phonetic categories of these vowels. The rhoticized vowel /C/ is
articulated with round lips and a raised tongue, resulting in a unique character
associated with its low third formant (Ladefoged, 2001), which may have aided
the experimental participants in acquiring it.3
As expected, the experimental participants had the most trouble differentiating between the /A/ and /2/ vowels. The phonetic similarity of /A/, /2/, and
Japanese /a/ with respect to lip rounding and tongue height results in all three
vowels having a similar spectral structure (Keating & Huffman, 1984; Ladefoged,
2001). This might have contributed to the confusion of the Japanese participants
in distinguishing the /A/-/2/ contrast. The temporal differences between AE /A/
and /2/ may have also played an important role. In Japanese, vowel duration is
phonemic and the primary perceptual cue to vowel length (Fujisaki, Nakamura, &
Imoto, 1975; Ingram & Park, 1997), with variations in formant frequency not
playing a significant role when the primary durational cue is present (Kinoshita,

Applied Psycholinguistics 26:2
Lambacher et al.: Identification training of AE vowels by Japanese

244

Behne & Arai, 2002). Recall the results of the acoustic analysis in Experiment 2,
which showed the experimental participants produced a nativelike temporal difference between the /A/ and /2/ vowels in the posttest. However, they might have
utilized the durational cue exclusively when attempting to distinguish the /A/-/2/
contrast, as opposed to being sensitive to spectral differences. It could be that more
rigorous auditory training in the AE /A/-/2/ contrast is required before Japanese
learners can begin to successfully attend to the salient acoustic properties that
distinguish these two AE vowels, and thus begin to establish robust categories for
them.
These results, in general, would appear to support current theories of nonnative
vowel acquisition (i.e., Flege's SLM and Best's PAM). According to the SLM, L2
vowels that are least like any L1 vowel will be easier to establish robust categories
of than similar L2 vowels (Flege 1995a). Of the five AE vowels examined in
this study, the trained group overall exhibited the greatest improvement in /C/,
which is least like any Japanese vowel in terms of phonetic and acoustic quality.
In contrast, they had the most difficulty with both /A/ and /2/, which differ only
slightly from Japanese /a/. According to PAM (Best, 1995), L2 learners will have
more difficulty distinguishing a pair of L2 sounds if both are identified in terms
of a single L1 category. Japanese learners must learn to identify AE /A/ as distinct
from the nearby /2/, both of which are likely to be assimilated to Japanese /a/
(Strange et al., 1998).
Nevertheless, we hasten to point out that the purpose of this study was not to test
directly the validity of speech learning theories as proposed by the SLM or PAM.
In fact, such a test would require cross-language mapping, dissimilarity ratings,
and/or discrimination data that we did not collect. Also, whereas Best (1995)
discusses the possibilities for nonnative binary contrasts in terms of discrimination, this research focused upon multiple-response identification for multiple
vowels. This distinction is important, because identification taps into memory
for categories, rather than assessing the ability to detect differences between two
sounds presented for comparison.
The results of the present study, as a whole, would appear to also support the
claim that given sufficient input, adult learners can improve their identification
and production of at least some nonnative vowels (Rochet, 1995). The vowel identification training technique we employed was generally successful in improving
the trained participants' identification and production of the target AE vowels,
which was most likely due to the nature of the task and the variability of the
stimuli presented (Logan et al., 1991). Nevertheless, the experimental participants
still failed to achieve nativelike levels of performance for each of the target AE
vowels, particularly the /A/ and /2/ vowels. It is expected that certain sounds will
be more difficult for L2 learners to acquire than others. Not all nonnative sounds
are equally identified and produced well. Some can be readily improved, whereas
others are inherently more difficult and require more time, input, and training
(Bohn & Flege, 1990), which can also be the case for children learning their
L1 (Macken & Ferguson, 1981). The ability of L2 learners to pronounce difficult L2 sounds authentically will ultimately depend on their ability to accurately
differentiate the auditory characteristics of the sounds and transfer this acoustic
information into articulation.

We acknowledge that laboratory training cannot take the place of naturalistic
exposure to a target language. Prior research has, in fact, shown that as adult
learners gain sufficient experience in the target language they come to perceive
and pronounce certain L2 vowels more accurately (Bohn & Flege, 1990; Polka,
1995; Werker, 1994; Yamada, 1995). L2 learners who are involved in conversations
with native speakers in naturalistic settings do exhibit better performance in L2
speech skills, which may be due to the fact that it provides them with a wider
exposure to speech produced by diverse talkers in a more varied environment than
would be the case in laboratory experiments (MacKain et al., 1981).
CONCLUSION

In summary, the results here confirm earlier findings that, despite the effects of
prior L1 experience on a learner's phonological system, identification training can
facilitate both identification and production performance by a group of adult L2
learners, even without any explicit production training. The results also present
new evidence that the use of a highly variable identification training procedure
with feedback can be successfully extended to training on a multiple number of
L2 vowels, as opposed to merely a single (binary) nonnative consonant contrast.
Although the overall accuracy of the experimental group was greater than that of
the control group in the identification posttest, their improvement in identification
and production performance varied across task and vowel. The results showed
that the experimental group's productions were more intelligible than the control
group's for each of the five target AE vowels. In addition, an acoustic analysis of
the experimental group's posttest vowel productions revealed less spectral overlap
between their vowel category formations than the control group's. Taken as a
whole, the results of this study successfully demonstrated that high variability
identification training with immediate feedback can yield a small but significant
improvement in identification and production performance of multiple nonnative
vowels by L2 adult learners.

NOTES
1. The University of Aizu is well known in Japan for its strong program in computer
science and engineering, and the majority of its students are male.
2. A majority of the stimuli were nonsense words (e.g., hup, haup). Of the few real words
contained in each of the three separate auditory tasks within Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e.,

the identification pre-/posttest, identification training task, and production task), the
five target AE vowels were equally represented throughout.
Research by Iverson et al. (2003) has shown that native Japanese rely more on the
F2 than F3 formant frequency in distinguishing the English /r/-/l/ contrast. However,
there are no real data yet that show whether Japanese adults use the same cue when
distinguishing -r colored vowels from other phonemes.
