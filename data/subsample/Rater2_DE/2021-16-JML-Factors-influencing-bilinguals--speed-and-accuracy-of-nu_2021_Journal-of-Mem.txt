Are bilinguals faster and/or better at performing numerical judgments in one language than in their other
language? What factors moderate language differences in number processing ease? To address these issues, we
conducted a meta-analysis of 38 studies (based on 1861 participants) in which bilinguals' speeded performance
and accuracy on number tasks was compared across languages within subjects. Analysis of 63 independent effect
sizes for reaction time data and 28 for accuracy data showed an overall language difference favoring the first
language. This effect was particularly observed in reaction time studies for number tasks involving arithmetic
judgments or number naming. The L1 effect was characteristic of bilinguals with low or medium proficiency in
the second language, those who were schooled in the first language, and those whose stated preference for
arithmetic was the first language. Further, a first language advantage was most characteristic of late bilinguals
(for reaction time). For accuracy, additional moderators of a first language advantage included differences be
tween the languages in decade unit counting system. No other effects were significant. The findings lend support
to models of number cognition that posit format-sensitive codes. They further clarify that a privileging of the first
language is not uniform but varies by bilingualism onset, proficiency, language of early schooling, and languagespecific characteristics.

Introduction
When counting or performing basic computations such as adding or
multiplying, people typically resort to subvocalizing numbers. This
anecdotal observation suggests that number processing interfaces with
language processing at some level. For bilingual individuals, that is,
people who regularly use two (or more) languages in everyday contexts,
anecdotal and survey accounts point to a first language preference for
counting and mental arithmetic, particularly if it is the language in
which these skills were learned (Dewaele, 2007; Vaid & Menon, 2000).
In cognitive research on number processing, a central issue is
whether numerical information is represented in an abstract, formatindependent repository or is sensitive to the format in which the infor
mation is presented (numeric vs. verbal) or responded to. Models of
number cognition differ in the role they assign to format in internal
representations of number (see Campbell, 2015; Colome, Bafalluy, &

Noel, 2011 for a review). The question of whether numbers are repre
sented in an abstract or a language-dependent format is easily testable in
multiple language users (Bernardo, 2002). Indeed, several studies of
number cognition in such users have emerged. These studies point to an
effect of language of presentation and/or language of response in
number judgments of various kinds and to differing degrees.
Understanding how and when language affects number processing
and representation is important on a theoretical level as it can provide
useful information that can inform models of number cognition in bi
linguals and monolinguals alike. Furthermore, the topic has added sig
nificance for psycholinguistic research on bilingualism which has not
tended to consider number cognition in its purview. The issue also has
practical significance as it may inform educational policy on the choice
of language for early formal instruction or assessment in math for dual
language users, who comprise an ever-growing segment of the school
age population in the United States and elsewhere (Lee & Lee, 2017).

Following the conventional terminology in the bilingualism litera
ture, we will use L1 to refer to the bilingual's first or primary language,
the language that is acquired and used at home, and L2 as a subsequently
acquired language, typically learned and used at school. Of course, this
terminology assumes that the two languages are acquired sequentially,
the second acquired somewhat later than the first. This would be the
case for so-called late bilinguals. For early bilinguals, both languages
would be considered primary as both would be acquired at the same
time, at home. Most studies in the number literature have focused on late
bilinguals, thus the L1-L2 distinction is an appropriate way to study
language differences in number judgments.
Some studies of bilingual number processing support an L1 advan
tage (Tamamaki, 1993) while others do not (Guillaume, 2011). Further,
some studies find an influence of one language on performance in
another when switching between languages (Meuter & Allport, 1999)
whereas others find no influence of either language on the other
(Macizo, Herrera, Paolieri, & Roman, 2010). Thus, the bilingual's two
languages can sometimes differ in the speed of retrieval of number facts,
in performing mental calculations, and/or in number judgments of other
kinds. However, specifying when a particular language will show faster
and/or more accurate responses in number judgments is not well un
derstood. Is a language preference always in the direction of the L1, or
can it favor another language, e.g., the language in which the bilingual
received early schooling, if different from the L1? How might age of
onset of bilingualism or proficiency in the two languages affect number
processing across languages? How might the relative similarity or
dissimilarity between the two languages on certain dimensions affect
bilinguals' number performance? This meta-analysis provides the first
quantitative and systematic investigation of these questions. Before
proceeding to the meta-analysis, a brief overview of models of number
cognition, together with a discussion of possible moderators of bilingual
number judgment performance, is in order.

Number access happens by the interconnection between codes, via
transcoding. In addition, this model theorizes that numerical facts re
cruit language based on rote memory learned early in life (e.g., aca
demic settings). Finally, the triple code model proposes that specific
brain regions are associated with the three posited codes. Thus, while
the abstract model argues that number representations get accessed
independently of input format (digit vs. verbal), both the encodingcomplex and triple code models highlight format or notation as play
ing a role in retrieving number information.
Bilingual encoding complex (BEC) model: hierarchy of codes
A bilingual extension of a format-sensitive model was proposed by
Bernardo (1999, 2001). In this model, which follows most directly from
the encoding complex model, there are three codes differing in repre
sentational strength (see Fig. 1): digits are the primary code, L1 number
words form a secondary code and L2 number words form a tertiary code.
Bernardo's bilingual encoding complex model, thus, theorizes repre
sentational disparities between languages and predicts that number
performance in the L2 will be worse than that in L1, and that perfor
mance will be best for numbers presented in digit format.
We turn next to a consideration of variables that may be relevant to
investigate as potential moderators of language differences in number
processing.
Task characteristics
Tasks used in the bilingual number cognition literature have ranged
widely from self-reported language preferences in number calculation
(Chiaro, 2009; Dewaele, 2007) to offline measures of problem-solving
accuracy (Bernardo & Calleja, 2005; Jimenez-Jimenez, 2015) to on
line tasks. Offline tasks (which have no time constraints) may allow
participants to adopt a response strategy in the language they may feel
most comfortable (see Garcia, Cieslicka, & Heredia, 2015). Online
behavioral tasks (which do have time constraints), conversely, reduce
the likelihood of reliance on ad hoc response strategies. Online measures
are assumed to tap into automatic processes more, that is, those that are
less subject to conscious strategic influence (Garcia et al., 2015) and, as
such, may be more sensitive in detecting language effects, if there are
any. Online tasks used in bilingual number studies have included veri
fication of solutions to arithmetic problems (e.g., is 4 x 5 = 21?), actual
calculations (e.g., simple sums or multiplication), judgment tasks (e.g.,
what number is smallest/larger?) and number naming speed in each lan
guage (see Salillas & Carreiras, 2014; Venkatraman, Siong, Chee, &
Ansari, 2006).

Models of number cognition
Models of number cognition differ in how they theorize notation or
format effects (i.e., digit vs. word). Three distinct models have been
proposed. McCloskey and associates propose that number symbols are
represented amodally in an abstract code (McCloskey, 1992; McCloskey,
Caramazza, & Basili, 1985; McCloskey, Sokol, & Goodman, 1986). Ac
cording to this view, the format of a number at encoding, e.g., Arabic
numeral 1 or 25 or its verbal notation (one or twenty-five) is not pre
served, and both are stored in an abstract form. In this model, numerical
input regardless of its input notation will access abstractly stored in
formation and generate a relevant output format.
Whereas, for McCloskey, if number format is preserved at all it is
preserved incidentally, Campbell's (1994) encoding complex model (see
also Campbell & Clark, 1988) accords a central role to format in
determining how numbers are accessed or represented (see also Fias,
2001; Cohen Kadosh & Walsh, 2009; Cohen Kadosh, Henik, & Rubins
ten, 2008). A main tenet of the encoding-complex is a network of formatspecific codes. Number processing is viewed as an interaction between
digit, magnitude, number lexicon, and arithmetic fact codes that engage
with each other to carry out a given number task. Distinct format mo
dalities will engage distinct codes but certain processes such as number
comprehension, calculation, and production that require access to
mental representations will access a shared code in the network.
A third framework is Dehaene's (1992) triple code model (see also
Dehaene, 1996; Dehaene & Akhavein, 1995; Dehaene & Cohen, 1995,
1997; Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu, & Tsivkin, 1999; Naccache &
Dehaene, 2001), which posits a functional integration between
language-dependent and three abstract codes with specified functions: a
magnitude code, which is in charge of semantic number knowledge,
simple subtraction and division, a verbal code which is in charge of
simple addition and multiplication (i.e., fact retrieval), and a visual code
in charge of equivalence judgements and advanced multiplication.

Yet even with a given task, slight changes in the methodology may
lead to different outcomes (see Dijkstra, Timmermans, & Schriefers,
2000, for a discussion in bilingual activation affected by task demands).
For example, Zhang et al. (2015) found in a number naming task that
when Chinese-English bilinguals were cued with a specific language,
participants' L1 outperformed their L2, but when they could freely
choose what language to use in naming a number, this difference dis
appeared. Similarly, the presence of language differences in mental
arithmetic performance may be sensitive to whether or not the problems
are presented in separate language blocks. Thus, any comprehensive
analysis of bilingual number representation needs to take task and
related design parameters into account.
In the literature on number cognition in bilinguals, there is support
for an L1 preference in offline tasks, such as reasoning problems (Ber
nardo & Calleja, 2005), arithmetic calculations (Marsh & Maki, 1976;
McClain & Huang, 1982), and other tasks (Chincotta & Underwood,
1996; Klichowski & Kroliczak, 2017; Stringer, 2000; Wang, Lin, Kuhl, &
Hirsch, 2007). An L1 performance advantage on arithmetic calculation
was found even after several days of training given in L2 (Spelke &
Tsivkin, 2001). An L1 advantage has also been reported in online
behavioral tasks such as number naming or speeded verification of
number facts, that is, tasks that tap into automatic processing (e.g.,
Campbell & Dowd, 2012; Duyck & Brysbaert, 2008; Frenck-Mestre &
Vaid, 1993; Lotus Lin, Imada, & Kuhl, 2019; Venkatraman et al., 2006;
Zhang et al., 2015).
Yet it is not necessarily the case that the first acquired language will
always be the one preferred for number processing, particularly if the
language in which bilinguals learned to do arithmetic was different than
the first acquired language. This situation is quite common, and there
fore its impact needs to be evaluated. Indeed, when one considers
studies that report an L2 preference for mental arithmetic or perfor
mance differences favoring the L2 (e.g., Ardila, Rosselli, Ostrosky-Solis,
Marcos, Granda, & Soto, 2000; Ardila, Benettieri, Church, Orozco, &
Saucedo, 2019; Guillaume, 2011; Vaid & Menon, 2000), most report L2
as the participants' language of instruction.

observed that bilinguals in the U.S. showed different preference re
sponses for number judgments depending on the degree of their first and
second language proficiency. Thus, language proficiency is included as a
potential moderator in our meta-analysis.
A third potential moderator of bilingual number judgments is age of
onset of bilingualism. When a bilingual acquires the two languages
(simultaneously or successively), it has been a robust variable in studies
of bilingual language processing, shown to have distinct cognitive and
neuropsychological repercussions (Gullifer, Chai, Whitford, Pivneva,
Baum, Klein, & Titone, 2018; Hull & Vaid, 2005, 2007; Klein, Mok,
Chen, & Watkins, 2014; Vaid, 1987). We considered it important to
include this variable as a potential moderator with the expectation that
differences between the two languages, if present, should be more pro
nounced in late bilinguals, independent of any differences between
groups in proficiency.
Another potential moderator of number performance is bilinguals'
stated language preference for mental arithmetic. Whereas the first ac
quired language is typically stated as the preferred language for arith
metic, in some cases both languages are equally available (see Ellis &
Hennelly, 1980) and in other cases the second learned language
(particularly, if it is the language of schooling) is the preferred language
(Vaid & Menon, 2000), at least among bilingual populations whose L2 is
the language of the host country (e.g., Spanish-English bilinguals living
in the U.S.). However, even with this population there are some dis
crepancies (e.g., Ardila et al. 2019; Febre, Lewis, Garcia, & Vaid, 2018).
Other studies (Chiaro, 2009; Dewaele, 2007) hint at an L2 preference
despite having received more formal education in L1. Although it may
be the case that language proficiency and stated language preference for
mental arithmetic are overlapping constructs, it is not clear from the
extant literature the degree to which the latter by itself may moderate
number performance across languages.
Language-pair characteristics
Languages differ on a number of dimensions. Two of potential rele
vance for bilinguals' number judgments are similarity or difference in
the structure of the number system and in the languages' orthography.
With respect to number system structure, Gonzalez and Kolers (1982)
had participants complete an addition verification task in which they
were shown numerals either in Arabic numeral (digit) format, Roman
numeral format, or a combination of both. There were reaction time
differences between number systems. The authors argue that the
uniqueness of each number system's structure may lead to differences in
how numbers are represented and accessed (see also Campbell, Kanz, &
Xue, 1999). Relatedly, some languages exhibit differences in their
counting patterns. To illustrate, seventy-five in Dutch is rendered vijfen
zeventig, or literally, five and seventy, in which we see a reversal in the
decade-unit relationship. Some studies have examined processing dif
ferences between languages that differ in their decade-unit counting
patterns (see Duyck & Brysbaert, 2008; Prior, Katz, Mahajna, &
Rubinsten, 2015, for examples involving English and Dutch and Arabic
and Hebrew, respectively). Van Rinsveld et al. (2015), for instance,
tested German-French bilinguals on a task requiring them to judge the
largest magnitude between given number word pairs. They found that
when compared to either German or French monolinguals, the bi
linguals tended to perform comparably. However, bilinguals were faster
in German than in French. This provides some indication that counting
pattern differences between a bilingual's languages may be associated
with mental representation differences, in line with Campbell's (1994)
model.
Languages differ as well in their orthography. The bilingual number
literature contains studies of users with a shared script (e.g., SpanishEnglish) and studies of users with different scripts, (e.g., MandarinEnglish, Campbell et al., 1999; Arabic-Spanish, Macizo, Herrera, &
Kibboua, 2015; Arabic-Hebrew; Ganayim & Ibrahim, 2014). It may be
useful to consider if number word processing is differentially affected by

Language user characteristics
In a regression study of bilinguals' self-reports of preferred language
for mental arithmetic and everyday number use, Vaid and Menon (2000)
found that language of early instruction was one of the strongest pre
dictors. Salillas and Wicha (2012) similarly note that a general language
preference in numeric tasks is preserved throughout adulthood and
suggest that this is likely related to the language of early schooling. That
is, if L1 is the language of schooling, L1 number representations may be
the most accessible code for number processing if instruction happens to
be in the bilinguals' primary, first learned language, and one may expect
an L1 advantage in number processing. But if the language of instruction
differs from the home language, a shift to the L2 may be observed, not
only in self-reports of preferred language for number processing, but
also in actual number performance. This is supported in a study of
Filipino-English bilingual children schooled in English (Bernardo, 1999;
see also Ardila et al., 2000; Chincotta & Underwood, 1996; FrenckMestre & Vaid, 1992, Exp. 2; Guillaume, 2011).
Another potential moderator of number judgment is proficiency in
the second language. Garcia, Cieslicka, and Heredia (2020) provide
compelling evidence that bilinguals differing in language proficiency
may show different access mechanisms for mental representations, at
least in lexical ambiguity research (for similar findings, see Costa, Car
amazza, & Sebastien-Galles, 2000; Durlik, Szewczyk, Muszynski, Wod
niecka, & Schiller, 2016; Heredia & Cieslicka, 2016, Jared & Szucs,
2002; Poarch & van Hell, 2012). Notably, greater proficiency in one
language vs. the other affects the speed and accuracy of retrieving lex
ical representations. If number representations show independent verbal
code stores for each language, then language proficiency should also
moderate distinct patterns of activation. Jimenez-Jimenez (2015)

1. Study had to be written in English.
2. Study participants were mostly adults (18+ years of age)1 from nonclinical population (e.g., no aphasia, dyscalculia, or learning disorder
diagnoses, as defined by different versions of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders throughout the years in the
search range: DSM-II, 1974; DSM-III, 1980; DSM-III-R, 1987; DSMIV, 1994; DSM-IV-TR, 2000; DSM-5, 2013, see American Psychiat
ric Association, 2013).
3. It was possible to infer proficiency in participants' both languages
(self-report or other means of assessment).
4. Study listed direct number manipulation (e.g., counting, number
naming, basic arithmetic operation such as addition, multiplication,
division, and/or subtraction).
5. Study reported both reaction or response time (RT) and accuracy as
the outcome variables.2
6. Study used a within-groups design (e.g., participants tested in both
their L1 and L2) and reported results from testing identified L1 and
L2.
7. Study reported enough descriptive (e.g., means or standard devia
tion) or inferential statistics (e.g., F, t) to compute effect sizes.

having a shared script vs. two different scripts. Since biscriptality is an
important, if somewhat neglected, variable in bilingual language pro
cessing (e.g., Vaid, Chen, & Rao, 2020), with implications for brain
functioning as well (e.g., Rao & Vaid, 2017), we wondered if script
differences would capture some of the variability in the bilingual
number literature.
The meta-analysis
This meta-analytic review tests a general question and a set of spe
cific questions. The general question is whether number processing is
faster (and more accurate) in the first acquired language (L1) than in the
second acquired language (L2). The specific questions are whether
bilingual number processing is moderated by specific factors. Noting
that bilinguals are not homogeneous (see Vaid & Meuter, 2017) but
differ from other bilinguals in important ways as a function of their
language acquisition histories and patterns of language use (Dunn & Fox
Tree, 2009; Heredia, 1996), we examined potential sources of variability
associated with language user characteristics. Thus, level of proficiency
in the second acquired language, a major factor in studies of mental
representation of language, was included as a moderator. Similarly, to
look at the effect of language of early instruction as a potential moder
ator of language differences in number processing, we coded studies
based on whether the language of early schooling was the same as or
different from the first spoken language. Finally, to clarify if the L1
advantage is particularly characteristic of late bilinguals, we coded for
age of onset of bilingualism. In addition, we examined the self-reported
language preference for arithmetic, the type of number task (arithmetic,
naming, or magnitude comparison), two characteristics of the language
pairs (in counting style and script), and an aspect of the experimental
design (presentation language blocked or randomized).

Exclusion criteria
Criteria for excluding studies from the meta-analysis were as follows:
1. Study did not provide enough information on participants' bilingual
profile (e.g., Martinez-Lincoln, Cortinas, & Wicha, 2015; Todovora,
2011).
2. Study did not report clear (Salillas & Carreiras, 2014; Salillas, Bar
raza, & Carreiras, 2015) or sufficient (e.g., Campbell, 2005; Declerck,
Koch, & Philipp, 2012; Geary, Cormier, Goggin, Estrada, & Lunn,
1993; Elliot, 1991; McClain & Huang, 1982, Experiment 2; Macizo,
Herrera, Paolieri, & Roman, 2010, Experiment 3; Wong, Bull, &
Ansari, 2018) results on reaction time and accuracy comparisons
associated with number word processing.
3. Study compared bilingual populations like children or adolescent
with no speeded tasks (e.g., Bernardo, 2005; Bialystok & Codd, 1997;
Hemsley, Holm, & Dodd, 2014; Lee & Lee, 2017; Lindholm-Leary &
Borsato, 2005; Kirk, 2011; Williamson, 1999) or their comparisons to
adult populations (e.g., Van Rinsveld, Schiltz, Landerl, Brunner &
Ugen, 2016, Experiment 2) or adolescent
4. Study language comparison was between monolinguals and bi
linguals (e.g., Mielicki, Kacinik, & Wiley, 2017; Pomerantz, 2016;
Van Rinsveld, Schiltz, Landerl, Brunner & Ugen, 2016, Experiment
1), bimodal bilinguals (e.g., English-American Sign Language user;
Vaid & Corina, 1989), participants with more than one L1 and L2 (e.
g., multiple language combinations such as Spanish-English, KoreanEnglish in the same participant pool), or had multilinguals, or those
speaking more than two different languages (e.g., Dewaele, 2007;
Jackson, Swainson, Cunnington, Jackson, 2001; Jackson, Swainson,
Mullin, Cunnington, & Jackson, 2004; Meuter & Allport, 1999).
5. Study reported only on switch costs among bilinguals from L1-to-L2
and L2-to-L1 (e.g., Chen, Yanke, & Campbell, 2016; Hahn, Saalbach,
& Grabner, 2017; Saalbach, Eckstein, Andri, Hobi, & Grabner, 2013;
Spelke & Tsivkin, 2001; Venkatraman et al., 2006), measured L1-toL2 vs. L2-to L1-translation effects (e.g., Herrera, 2019, Experiment

Method
Literature search
A literature search was conducted for empirical studies of L1 and L2
differences in bilingual number representation. The search was limited
to studies conducted from January 1976 through December 2018.
Electronic databases such as PsychINFO, Web of Science, Science Direct,
Jstor, WordlCat (OCLC), ProQuest (Dissertations and Theses), and
Google Scholar were consulted to reach the published material. Con
ference meetings such as Psychonomics and International Symposium of
Bilingualism were consulted for unpublished empirical works.
The keywords used included bilingual, number, math, arithmetic,
calculation, cognition, mental calculation, number processing, and number
fact. We performed iterations of these keywords by using search terms
with "AND/OR" to be able to capture relevant empirical studies. We also
extended the literature search and conducted forward and backward
searches on selected seminal articles that used a within-subjects design.
We defined seminal paper as one contributing an important or novel
finding to the bilingual number cognition literature. We used a couple of
seminal papers per decade. For example, we used Marsh and Maki
(1976), McClain and Huang (1982), Vaid (1985), Vaid and FrenckMestre (1991), Meuter and Allport (1999), Campbell and Epp (2004),
and Van Rinsveld et al. (2015).
Inclusion criteria

1

We included 17 effect sizes from studies using adolescent populations tested
on similar tasks as those with the young adult populations.
2
At the suggestion of Dr. Marc Brysbaert, we conducted a subsequent metaanalysis model focusing on accuracy. This model examined studies that used
both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables such that accuracy was
recorded for experimental trials subjecting participants to time constrains. The
main aim of this analysis was to check for possible accuracy tradeoffs. We did
not find any indication of it.

Two independent reviewers collected empirical studies conforming
to the next inclusion criteria:

3), or no direct comparison between participants' L1 and L2 per
formance was reported (e.g., De Brauwer, Duyck, & Brysbaert, 2008;
Magiste, 1982; Salillas & Wicha, 2012).
6. Study focused on compatibility between languages with different
unit-decade counting systems (e.g., Macizo, Herrera, Roman, &
Martin, 2010, Macizo, Herrera, Paolieri, & Roman, 2010, Macizo,
Herrera, Roman, & Martin, 2011b; Van Rinsveld, Schiltz, Landerl,
Brunner & Ugen, 2016).
7. Study focused solely on online accuracy or error rate percentages as
outcome variable without considering time constraints in experi
mental trials (e.g., Frenck-Mestre & Vaid, 1993, Experiment 3),
collected offline data only (e.g., Ardila et al., 2000; Bernardo, 1996,
1999; Hammer, 2018; Kazandjian, Cavezian, Zivotofsky, & Chokron,
2010; Magiste, 1979; Takano & Noda, 1993; Vaid & Frenck-Mestre,
1991, Experiment 1), or number stimuli were embedded within

in any of the coded studies, and so we opted to try several values to
assess sensitivity. We ran values from 0.5 through 0.9 to find an
appropriate value that would not inflate change-scores effect size (C.
Thompson, personal communication, May 2019).3 After finding
considerable variation in results, we settled for values between 0.8 and
0.9, and ran values contained between them (e.g., .81, .82. .83, etc.).
Finally, sensitivity assessment was established at r-value of 0.85 to
compute effect size and variance. This value was selected to ensure a
more conservative calculation of effect sizes. We assigned a positive
effect size value when the study confirmed an L1 advantage and a
negative effect-size value otherwise. This same procedure was applied
when computing a mean-gain effect size using t-scores.

When t-tests were reported (i.e., Ardila et al., 2000; Lotus Lin et al.,
2019; Salillas & Wicha, 2012), the effect size was computed following
formula (3), where t is the test result from the reported paired-samples
test measuring the effect between L1 and L2, n is the total sample size,
and r is the correlation between L1 and L2 scores. We followed the same
procedure described for F to obtain the correlation coefficient value.

Procedure
Two researchers separately filtered search results (n = 3143). They
eliminated search result duplicates (n = 2123) to narrow down articles.
Further narrowing was done by looking at title and abstract topics. The
filtering process yielded 218 eligible articles (see Fig. 2 for Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, PRISMA,
flowchart for specific breakdown). We found 11 unpublished empirical
works using outlined conference proceedings. Upon close inspection of
the reported methodology and results, only three of these met criteria for
inclusion but because they were not available in time they are not
included.
The same two researchers performed the coding scheme by entering
inclusion variables (e.g., sample size, participant age, bilingual's lan
guages, bilingual proficiency, early language of instruction, publication
type, dependent variable used, language of presentation, task type or
paradigm measuring calculation, results such as reaction time and
standard deviation of L1 and L2, and test-statistic result) to ensure
reliability. The coding scheme resulted in the exclusion of 180 articles
which did not meet empirical study criteria but presented a qualitative
report of the results (e.g., Chiaro, 2009), had other focus such as
measuring preference (e.g., Vaid & Menon, 2000), used lengthier
reasoning problems (Bernardo & Calleja, 2005), or displayed offline
data collection methods (e.g., Dewaele, 2007). This reduced the final
number of articles to 38.
Researchers coded information in two independent Google spread
sheets. Coding discrepancies were resolved by discussion until reaching
a mutually accepted solution. The inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded a
total of 63 statistically independent effect sizes (and another 14
dependent effect sizes). The total sample size was 1861 bilingual par
ticipants (see Table 1).
Effect size was calculated by subtracting the L1 mean reaction time
(and accuracy) from L2. L1 and L2 designations were those used by the
authors and generally refer to the first and second acquired language. A
positive effect size would represent a faster reaction time (or more ac
curate response) in L1. Effect size was expressed in Cohen's d in mean
gains or change score. We used Borenstein (2009) formulas to calculate
effect size depending on available study information. However, many of
our effect sizes come from relatively small sample sizes, and thus we
applied Hedges' g unbiased correction (see Hedges, 1981) to all obtained
effect sizes (dk )following formula (1) below.

We used formula (4) to compute 25 of the 63 mean-gain effect sizes
(e.g., Chincotta & Underwood, 1996 I-IV; Garcia, 2018; Herrera, 2019;
Macizo et al., 2015; Vaid, 1985; Van Rinsveld et al., 2015; Van Rinsveld,
Schiltz, Brunner, Landerl, & Ugen, 2016). In formula (4), Y1 and Y2 are,
respectively, second language and first language mean reaction times,
Sk Difference is the standard deviation difference for the kth of K studies
between the L1 and L2 reaction times, and r is the correlation between
L1 and L2 scores. We performed the L1 (as Y2) and L2 (as Y1) reversal in
means and standard deviations to obtain a positive number that would
remain consistent to the previous conceptualization of mean-gain effect
sizes. In this case, a faster reaction time is associated with a lower value
(e.g., 500 > 600), but having 500-600, as per formula (4), would return
a negative value (i.e., - 100) that points to an L1 advantage, but which
might be difficult to conceptualize as such. To measure accuracy, we
took the reported metric from L2 and subtracted it from L1. A positive
value reflected a first language advantage while a negative value re
flected a second language advantage. We followed the same procedure
described for F and t to obtain the imputed correlation coefficient value
where it was not provided. We used WebPlotDigitizer (version 4.2;
Rohatgi, 2019) to extract reaction time values from studies that pro
vided this information only in figure form (e.g., Campbell, 2005; Van
Rinsveld et al., 2015). However, extracted information from studies like

chosen as this information was not available from extracted studies:

When F-tests were reported, the change-score effect size was
computed using formula (2), where F is the test result from the reported
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing the effect be
tween L1 and L2, n is the total sample size, and r is the correlation

Sk Difference

Sutton, & Borenstein, 2006), three different quantitative methods were
approached, which take as reference a funnel plot measure summarizing
studies' obtained effect sizes (dk ) and their standard errors (see Fig. 5).
However, since these methods are not yet available for robust variance
estimation (RVE) meta-analysis, an appropriate method was used to
check publication bias on independent effect sizes (dk )(C. Thompson,
2019, personal communication, May 2019).

To calculate Sk Difference , or the standard deviation difference for the
kth of K studies, we had to use formula (5), where Sk Within , or the withingroups standard deviation, needed in turn to be computed by formula
(6), where S1 and S2 are the standard deviations for L2 and L1 associated
with mean reaction times, respectively.

Effect size calculation
Focal effect size was the mean gains difference of reaction times from
L1 to L2 coming from 63 statistically independent effect sizes. Effect
sizes were analyzed using the metafor package (version 2.4-0; Viecht
bauer, 2010) in R (version 4.0.2; R Core Team, 2020). Some studies
reported several outcomes from the same participant sample performing
different numerical tasks. Robust variance estimation (RVE) metaanalysis was implemented by using the robumeta package (version 2.0;
Fisher, Tipton, & Zhipeng, 2017) to compute RVE using the indepen
dent/dependent effect sizes. Analyses were conducted using random
effects (RE) and mixed effects (ME) models. Heterogeneity was calcu
lated using Q, I2, and T2 statistics.

(6)

In the case of Macizo et al. (2015), standard error was reported
instead of standard deviation. We used formula (7) where SE is standard
error and n is sample size.

Sk = SEk x nk
(7)
Finally, we used formula (8) to compute variance, where n is sample
size, d is the obtained mean-gains effect size (from either formula
described above) and r is the imputed correlation coefficient.

Moderator selection
To investigate the role of potential moderators of a first language
advantage in number processing, we identified specific moderators and
used categorical moderator analysis using an ANOVA-like conditional
random effects model, to follow up on unconditional overall models.
This modeling technique treats studies' effect sizes as dependent vari
ables and their characteristics (e.g., number task, participant profi
ciency) as independent variables. Each moderator was dummy-coded
based on information provided by the selected studies (see Table 1). The

moderators selected are described below.
Number Task. This moderator had three levels: arithmetic (calcu
lation or verification of addition, subtraction, multiplication or divi
sion), number naming (expressing a number in its verbal code), and
magnitude comparison (choosing which of two numbers is larger).
L2 Proficiency. Bilinguals' L2 proficiency was classified into three
levels: low, medium, and high. If the study reported that participants
were at the beginning stages of learning the L2, the proficiency would be
categorized as low. Medium proficiency was categorized based on selfratings or other formal bilingual assessments (e.g., the Language Expe
rience and Proficiency Questionnaire, the Common European Frame
work of Reference for languages) providing some indication of
intermediate proficiency. Finally, high proficiency was categorized
following the same criteria as medium proficiency. Authors' reports of
high proficiency were used when no other formal measures' results were
provided or other information such as being formally educated in both
languages since an early age (e.g., Van Rinsveld et al., 2015).
Bilingualism Onset. We drew from Hull and Vaid's (2007) guide
lines to capture this moderator. We coded as early onset those studies
reporting that their bilingual population learned both languages before
the age of 6. Studies reporting that their sample learned the other lan
guage after the age of 6 were coded as late onset. Some studies included
samples from which participants came from early and late bilingual
onset, which was coded as a third level.
Language Shift/Language of Instruction. This moderator con
sisted of two levels: no shift (L1 language of instruction) or shift (L2
language of instruction). Several studies (e.g., Garcia, 2018; Guillaume,
2011; Nishat, 2015) mentioned that participants grew up with Spanish
as L1 but that they feel more comfortable in English (L2) due to use of
English in school and in social activities outside the home.
Stated Language Preference for Arithmetic. This moderator had
three levels: L1, L2, or both languages. It was taken from what partici
pants reported or what the study author reported about participants'
preferred language.4
Decade-Unit Number System Differences. We looked at similarity
vs. difference in counting notation across the languages in the direction
of decade-unit. Thus, for example, we coded Klichowski and Kroliczak's
(2017) study as "similar" given that English and Polish follow the same
decade-unit counting pattern, but Van Rinsveld et al.'s (2015) study
(German-French bilinguals) was coded as "dissimilar" given that both
languages exhibit unique decade-unit counting patterns.
Script Differences. For this moderator, we looked at whether the
bilinguals' languages had a shared or different orthography. For
example, Guillaume's (2011) study of Spanish-English bilinguals would
be coded as similar in orthography but Tamamaki's (1993) study of
Japanese-English bilinguals would be coded as different.
Experiment Design: Language Presentation as Blocked vs. Ran
domized. Even though all studies used a within-subjects design, we
wanted to compare studies in which trials were presented in separate
language blocks vs. when language of trials was random.

Results
Reaction time data
Effect sizes ranged from - 1.05 to 2.88. Over 73% of the effect sizes
showed an advantage of L1 over L2. The total sample of collected studies
was 38 but 7 yielded 2 statistically independent effect sizes (e.g.,
Chincotta & Underwood, 1997b), two more studies yielded 3 (e.g.,
Garcia, 2018; Van Rinsveld, Schiltz, Landerl, Brunner & Ugen, 2016),
two more studies yielded 4 (e.g., Bernardo, 2001), and two more studies

Multicollinearity is difficult to assess between independent variables since
they are not continuous. Yet, by running diagnostics using the Perform
anceAnalytics package (Peterson & Carl, 2020) for RT we observed expected
correlation between L2 proficiency and language preference (r = .29, p < .05),
L2 proficiency and language shift (r = .34, p <.01), language preference and
language shift (r = .3, p < .05). For accuracy, we observed expected correlation
between L2 proficiency and language preference (r = .53, p < .01), L2 profi
ciency and language shift (r = .48, p <.01), and language preference and lan
guage shift (r = .35, p > .05). The between-factor collinearity obtained is not
exceptionally high, especially for reaction time cases, to warrant these mod
erators' exclusion (i.e., r  .8, see Harrer, Cuijpers, Furukawa, & Ebert, 2019).

yielded 5 (e.g., Van Rinsveld, Schiltz, Brunner, Landerl, & Ugen, 2016)
statistically independent effect sizes. Independent sample sizes ranged
from 8 to 94 bilinguals coming from different language pairs (see
Table 2).
Publication dates spanned from 1976 to 2019. Effect size variability,
as well as precision, showed heterogeneity among collected studies (see
Fig. 3). This was verified by homogeneity assessments. The Q statistic
reached statistical significance, Q (62) = 1312.53, p < .0001, thus
rejecting the homogeneity null hypothesis. The homogeneity assessment
was confirmed by the moderately high value of 95.28% obtained from
running the I2 statistic. This provided support for variability in effect
sizes beyond subject-level sampling error (see Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).
Therefore, we decided to run a random effects (RE) model based on
heterogeneity results and for result-generalizability purposes.
Additionally, we ran RVE models including 63 independent effect
sizes and around 14 additional dependent effect sizes (from using the
same participants more than once) and moderators as well as following
recommendations set by Fisher & Tipton (n.d.). In close inspection, RVE
and RE models did not differ substantially (most likely given the small
number of studies that have multiple measures taken from the same
participant sample). We will report results using the RE approach on
independent effect sizes, henceforth. We selected the effect size pro
duced by the most relevant arithmetic operation to provide clearer
insight to our research question (e.g., choosing multiplication over
subtraction or division from Ardila et al., 2000, as no other study in our
sample manipulated the latter arithmetic operations).
The RE model revealed that reaction time to L1 over L2 resulted in a
weighted effect size of 0.33 (SE = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.17, 0.48; p < .001),
see Fig. 3 for weight distribution percentages based on study precision.
This overall effect was statistically significant. Between-studies estimate
of dispersion, T2 = 0.38 (SE = 0.07), suggests variation from study to
study (see Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009; Deeks,
Higgins, & Altmanm, 2008). Post-hoc subgroup analyses were run after
suspicion of possible categorical moderator effects in the obtained re
sults and also to investigate our set of specific research questions. Sub
sequent sections explore separate ANOVA-like mixed-effects (ME)
models for the eight identified moderators.5 The subsequent moderator
analyses focus on reaction time.

appeared to moderate RT differences between L1 and L2. Specifically,
the mean effect of arithmetic operation was 0.35 (SE = 0.09) while
naming tasks was 0.57 (SE = 0.17), and - 0.13 (SE = 0.15) for judgment
comparisons. Only the last type of task did not reach statistical signifi
cance. Thus, an L1 advantage in reaction time was predicted by arith
metic and number naming tasks but not by magnitude comparison tasks.
Within-group variability was statistically significant for the three types
of number tasks: Arithmetic Qw (32) = 699.87, p < .001; naming Qw
(18) = 286.20, p < .001; and number comparisons, Qw (10) = 219.03,
p < .001 (see summary Table 2). This suggests that effect sizes varied
among different types of number tasks.
L2 proficiency
L2 proficiency influenced the amount of effect-size variability, Qb
(2) = 10.80, p < .01, revealing that heterogeneity varies as a function of
L2 proficiency. Specifically, the mean effect of the low L2 proficiency
group was 0.82 (SE = 0.15), medium L2 proficiency group was 0.55
(SE = 0.07), and 0.15 (SE = 0.11) for the high proficiency group. Both
the low and medium proficiency group effects were statistically different
from zero, indicating that the L1 advantage in number processing
characterized this bilingual subgroup (there was no L1 advantage in
bilinguals with high L2 proficiency). Within-group variability was also
statistically significant for the three categorized proficiency levels,
denoting effect size variability among the proficiency types: Low pro
ficiency, Qw (7) = 82.55, p < .001; medium proficiency, Qw
(12) = 45.36, p < .001; and high proficiency, Qw (37) = 835.71,
p < .001.
Bilingualism onset
The age of onset of bilingualism influenced the amount of effect-size
variability, Qb (2) = 9.52, p < .01. This finding suggests that heteroge
neity varies as a function of bilingual onset. However, only late onset
reached statistical significance (dME = 0.50, SE = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.33,

0.66; p < .0001). Early onset (dME = - 0.28, SE = 0.36; 95% CI = - 0.99,
0.43; p > .05) and combination of onset groups (dME = 0.002, SE = 0.19;
95% CI = - 0.38, 0.38; p > .05) were not different from zero. Withingroup variability was statistically significant all three groups: for early
onset, Qw (1) = 12.58, p < .001, late onset, Qw (34) = 462.08, p < .001,
and combined groups, Qw (7) = 139.95, p < .001.

Number task
Homogeneity statistic Q, an approximate chi-square distribution with
degrees of freedom k - 1, where k is the total number of effect sizes in
the set, was calculated for each categorical moderator (Qb) and each of
their levels (Qw). The number task factor explained statistically signifi
cant effect-size heterogeneity, Qb (2) = 9.25, p < .01. Number task

Language shift/language of instruction
Some studies reported that their participants had experienced a
language shift due to early language of instruction in the L2, thus sug
gesting they may be more adept in using L2 for number mental repre
sentations. In performing this moderator analysis, based on the provided
participant demographic description, we assumed that no language shift
occurred when it was not reported. The language shift moderator
accounted for statistically significant effect-size heterogeneity, Qb
(1) = 12.18, p < .001. This suggests that effect sizes varied between
participants who experienced a shift to L2 and those who did not. The
mean for the L2 shift was - 0.09 (SE = 0.20) but was not different from
zero. Contrastingly, the mean for participants who did not shift was 0.47
(SE = 0.07), which was statistically different from zero. Thus, for bi
linguals whose language of instruction corresponded to their first lan
guage, there was a first language advantage in number processing.
Additionally, within group variability was statistically significant for
both groups: the no shift group, Qw (45) = 612.78, p < .001, and the shift
group, Qw (15) = 345.10, p < .001.

We further tested the role of a) vocal versus button press responses to
number tasks, b) auditory, visual, and both modality stimulus presentation
formats, and c) adolescent versus young adult populations as moderators. The
analysis showed that vocal vs. manual response mode did explain a statistically
significant effect-size heterogeneity for RT, Qb (1) = 6.51, p < .05 and accuracy,
Qb (1) = 13.56, p < .001. Follow-up analysis showed that response mode
explained L1-L2 differences when participants responded vocally both in RT
(dME = 0.48, SE = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.71; p < .001) and accuracy (dME =
0.32, SE = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.46; p < .001).Stimulus presentation modality
did not explain a statistically significant effect-size heterogeneity for RT, Qb (2)
= 5.93, p = .052, but it did moderate accuracy, Qb (2) = 13.90, p < .01. Followup analysis for accuracy revealed that results were significant for auditory

stimulus presentation (dME = 0.26, SE = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.45; p < .01) and

Stated language preference for mental arithmetic
The language preference moderator also explained a statistically
significant effect-size heterogeneity, Qb (2) = 14.66, p < .001. Language

auditory/visual-combined modalities (dME = 0.36, SE = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.23,
0.50; p < .001), showing, the highest L1 advantage in the combined format.
Seventeen out of the 63 collected effect sizes came from participants under the
age of 18 (high schoolers mostly). Only 1 study (Cerda et al., 2019) tested a
younger population (mage = 10.7). Including age as a moderator (over 18 vs.
under 18 years) did not explain a statistically significant effect-size heteroge
neity for either RT, Qb (1) = 0.11, p = .75, or accuracy, Qb (1) = 2.05, p = .15.

preference for "both languages" shows a higher mean effect (dME = 0.56,

SE = 0.27) followed by L1 preference (dME = 0.44, SE = 0.08), and both
were different from zero. L2 preference, not surprisingly, showed the

10

O. Garcia et al.

Journal of Memory and Language 118 (2021) 104211

L2. One study yielded 2 statistically independent effect sizes (Stringer
2000), 3 (Garcia, 2018), and 5 (e.g., Van Rinsveld et al., 2015; Van
Rinsveld, Schiltz, Brunner, Landerl, & Ugen, 2016). The Q statistic
reached statistical significance, Q (27) = 230.63, p < .001, thus rejecting
the homogeneity null hypothesis. The homogeneity assessment was
confirmed by the moderately value of 88.29% obtained from running
the I2 statistic. Overall, these results provide support for variability in
effect sizes beyond subject-level sampling error (see Lipsey & Wilson,
2001). Therefore, we decided to run a random effects (RE) model based
on heterogeneity results and for result-generalizability purposes.
The RE model revealed that accuracy of L1 over L2 resulted in a
weighted effect size of 0.18 (SE = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.29; p < .01),
see Fig. 4 for weight distribution percentages based on study precision.
This overall effect reached statistical significance. Thus, it appears that
participants were slightly more accurate on their first language.
Although it should be interpreted with caution given the small effect
size, bilinguals were more accurate in their L1 (and, as noted earlier,
were also faster in their L1 than L2). This may be an indication of a lack
of speed-accuracy tradeoff. The subsequent moderator analyses focus on
accuracy results.

opposite magnitude (dME = - 0.24, SE = 0.18), yet it did not reach sta
tistical significance. Within-group variability was statistically significant
for two out of the three identified groups: L1 preference, Qw
(38) = 520.91, p < .001; L2 preference, Qw (11) = 315.44, p < .001; and
both L1 and L2, Qw (10) = 145.92, p < .001. This suggests that effect
sizes varied among different language preference profiles.
Decade-unit number system differences
Type of language pair did not significantly explain effect-size vari
ability, Qb (1) = .79, p = .37. Within-group variability did reach signif
icance for similar, Qw (39) = 906.03, p < .001, and dissimilar decadeunit language pairings, Qw (22) = 330.76, p < .001.
Script differences
The bilinguals' language pairs did not significantly contribute to
effect-size variability, Qb (1) = 0.23, p = .63. It failed to explain whether
being tested in different scripts (for Chinese and English) is associated
with L1 and L2 RT differences. Nevertheless, within-group variability
was statistically significant for the two groups: different number scripts,
Qw (11) = 167.49, p < .001, and similar number scripts, Qw
(50) = 1132.07, p < .001.

Number task
The moderator analysis for type of number task in accuracy was not
able to explain a statistically significant effect-size heterogeneity, Qb
(1) = 3.70, p = .054. Within-group variability did reach statistical sig
nificance for one of the three types of number tasks: arithmetic Qw
(23) = 199.85, p < .001 (see summary Table 4).

Blocked vs. random language presentation
Manipulation of language presentation in the experimental tasks also
did not explain statistically significant effect-size heterogeneity, Qb
(1) = 0.36, p = .55. However, mixing of the two languages in experi
mental trials accounted for statistically significant within-group vari
ability, Qw (28) = 716.24, p < .001, and so did presenting languages in
separate blocks, Qw (33) = 574.47, p < .001.

L2 proficiency
Bilingual's L2 proficiency explained effect-size variability, Qb
(2) = 18.96, p < .001, revealing that heterogeneity varies as a function
of L2 proficiency. The analysis showed that the mean effect of the low L2
proficiency group was 0.54 (SE = 0.05), medium L2 proficiency group
was 0.31 (SE = 0.06), and 0.02 (SE = 0.07) for the high proficiency
group. Yet, only the low and medium proficiency group effects are sta
tistically different from zero. Thus, the results indicate lower L2 profi
ciency is a predictor of an L1 advantage in accuracy of number
judgments. Within-group variability did not reach statistical signifi
cance for only one of the three proficiency levels: low proficiency, Qw
(3) = 2.73, p > .05; medium proficiency, Qw (7) = 18.34, p > .05; and
high proficiency, Qw (15) = 103.63, p < .001.

Accuracy data
L1 vs. L2
We ran an additional meta-analytic model on accuracy data. Only 15
studies (with 28 independent effect sizes) reported accuracy data along
side RT data (see Table 3). The effect sizes ranged from - 0.66 to 0.63.
Over 67.9% of the effect sizes showed a pattern of advantage of L1 over

Bilingualism onset
The bilingualism onset moderator did not explain effect-size het
erogeneity, Qb (2) = 2.19, p > .05. Within-group variability was only
statistically significant for late onset, Qw (19) = 144.54, p < .001. Early
onset and combined groups did not reach statistical significance
(p > .05).
Language shift/language of instruction
This moderator analysis also accounted for statistically significant
effect-size heterogeneity, Qb (2) = 40.02, p < .001, suggesting that a shift
to L2 in instruction predicted accuracy of L1 vs. L2 number judgments.
The mean for the L2 shift was - 0.11 (SE = 0.08), but not different from
zero, while the mean for the participants who did not shift languages
was 0.33 (SE = 0.05) and statistically significant. Taken together, this
suggests that a language shift in which L2 becomes the language of in
struction may offset an L1 advantage. Within group variability was
statistically significant for both groups: the no shift group, Qw
(17) = 69.09, p < .001, and the shift group, Qw (9) = 40.86, p < .001.
Stated language preference for mental arithmetic
This moderator also explained a statistically significant effect-size
heterogeneity, Qb (2) = 40.02, p < .001. Only the L1 preference mean
effect size (dME = 0.38, SE = 0.05) was statistically different from zero.

This indicates that participants with a stated L1 preference for mental
arithmetic showed an L1 advantage in number judgment accuracy.
Within-group variability, was statistically significant for two of the three
identified groups: L1 preference, Qw (14) = 39.93, p < .001; L2 prefer
ence, Qw (7) = 33.06, p < .001; and both L1 and L2, Qw (4) = 5.00,
p > .05.

Script differences
The variable of same/different orthographic scripts did not signifi
cantly contribute to effect-size variability, Qb (1) = 0.84, p = .36.
Within-group variability was statistically significant only for the similar
number scripts, Qw (22) = 216.01, p < .001 (different number scripts, Qw
(4) = 7.66, p > .05).

Decade-Unit number system differences
The variable of counting style also explained effect-size variability,
Qb (1) = 9.84, p < .01, for the pairs of language showing dissimilar
decade-unit counting patterns (dME = 0.35, SE = 0.06). Within-group
variability did reach significance for similar counting styles, Qw
(15) = 109.61, p < .001 and for dissimilar decade-unit language pair
ings, Qw (11) = 57.60, p < .001.

Blocked vs. Random language presentation
Manipulation of language presentation in the experimental tasks also
did not explain statistically significant effect-size heterogeneity for ac
curacy measures, Qb (1) = 2.60, p = .11. However, presenting languages
in separate blocks accounted for statistically significant within-group
variability, Qw (18) = 149.68, p < .001 and for the mixing of the two
languages in experimental trials Qw (8) = 47.57, p < .001.

Discussion

0.13

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine whether there is
a first language advantage in the speed and accuracy of bilingual
number judgments and secondly to investigate possible moderating ef
fects of language differences in number judgments. A total of 38 studies
directly compared bilinguals' reaction time in their two languages when
engaged in number naming, magnitude comparisons, or simple arith
metic tasks and 15 of these studies also examined accuracy across lan
guages. Random and mixed effects models were used to be able to
generalize beyond the studies sampled in this meta-analytic synthesis.

Language in number processing

With respect to our first question, of an overall language difference in
number judgment performance, the random effects model suggested a
small-to-moderate effect for reaction time responses and a small effect
for accuracy data in the direction of a first language advantage. This
outcome supports Bernardo's (1999, 2002) bilingual model. It also
provides support to Campbell's (1994) model which accords a central
role for language-dependent codes in number processing and represen
tation. Our meta-analytic findings demonstrate that people who speak
two languages perform number tasks differently across their two lan
guages, favoring their first acquired language.
Our second research question sought to determine if certain factors
pertaining to task characteristics, language characteristics, or language
user characteristics may moderate this language difference in number
judgment performance. Our initial model's heterogeneity results using
Q, I2, and T2 indices showed variability in effect sizes beyond subjectlevel sampling error (see Lipsey & Wilson, 2001), suggesting consider
able heterogeneity, as not all studies showed an overall faster processing
of L1 over L2. The following sections present a concise discussion of
moderator effects obtained in follow-up mixed-effects model analyses.

Tests for publication bias
Concerning publication bias, conducted on RT data, the funnel plot
(see Fig. 5) suggests moderate effect-size symmetry. A left-side impu
tation of two studies using trim and fill (Duval & Tweedie, 2000) sug
gested small chances of publication bias. Similarly, Egger's plot
asymmetry test (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997) did not reach
statistical significance, t (61) = 0.63, p = .53, further suggesting an
absence of publication bias. Finally, the Failsafe-N (Rosenthal, 1979)
showed 10,611 non-statistically significant effects needed to be added to
make the combined effect size statistically insignificant. These results,
taken together, argue against the possibility of publication bias in the
collected study samples.

Type of number task
This variable predicted RT differences between L1 and L2. Faster L1
than L2 performance was predicted when the task involved arithmetic or
number naming. Further, arithmetic tasks showed a larger L1 effect than
that observed for number comparison tasks, supporting previous liter
ature on number complexity and cognitive taxation (see Beckwith &
Restle, 1966; Logie, Gilhooly, & Wynn, 1994). However, an even larger
L1 predictive effect was observed for number naming tasks. Presumably,

their early schooling. The set of studies showing a shift to L2 as language
of instruction, by contrast, had a negative effect size, although it was not
statistically different from zero. The direction of the effect suggests that
when the language of instruction differs from the first acquired lan
guage, a first language advantage in number judgments is less likely to
occur, but the results do not support a clear L2 advantage in this case.
Only a few studies in our dataset showed a shift to L2 in instruction.
Thus, definitive conclusions about a shift to L2 in number judgments
may have to wait until there are more such cases.

this may reflect the fact that number naming requires producing a verbal
response, more so than arithmetic or magnitude judgment tasks and, as
such, may show larger L1-L2 differences.
L2 proficiency
Bilinguals' L2 proficiency resulted in statistically significant effectsize heterogeneity in both RT and accuracy analyses. That is, the pres
ence of an L1 advantage depended on participants' L2 proficiency.
Specifically, a higher L1-processing advantage was confined to those
participants who had low or medium proficiency in L2. Both low and
medium L2 proficiency showed relatively high mean effect sizes. The L1
advantage, however, is not found among bilinguals who show a higher
L2 proficiency, as their mean effect size was not statistically different
from zero. Not surprisingly, this finding suggests that bilinguals showing
high proficiency in both languages may organize number information
similarly in the two languages, and thus may retrieve number facts in
either language with comparable ease.
This result indicates that unlike previous accounts, based either on
self-reported language preferences (Dewaele, 2007) or performance
measures (Salillas & Wicha, 2012), it is not the case that bilinguals in
general will favor their L1 for number processing. Moreover, the results
of the high proficiency groups suggest that a refinement of Bernardo's
(1999) model is warranted to accommodate the case of balanced bi
linguals. As our findings suggest, bilinguals with more balanced levels of
proficiency in their two languages (high L2 proficient groups in the
present meta-analysis) show equal processing speed and accuracy across
verbal number codes in L1 and L2.

Stated language preference
Previous research shows that bilinguals report a distinct preference
in the language they use for mental arithmetic and to use numbers for
everyday tasks, such as figuring a discount, remembering a phone
number, telling the time, etc. (Chiaro, 2009; Dewaele, 2007; Vaid &
Menon, 2000). Our meta-analysis shows that stated language preference
for mental arithmetic was a predictor of an L1 advantage on number
tasks for bilinguals reporting a preference either for the L1 or for both
languages. When L2 preference was stated, the effect size results showed
an opposite pattern favoring an L2 advantage in number tasks, yet this
effect did not reach statistical significance. Overall, our results regarding
the preference moderator should be taken with caution as some of the
studies did not provide formal assessment of language preference.
Decade-unit number system differences
Our analysis examined whether a bilingual's language pairs that
have a similar/different decade-unit counting pattern would predict any
effects. We found that this moderator yielded an effect but only in the
accuracy data. Thus, at least for those bilinguals whose counting styles
are not compatible (e.g., decade-unit for a German-English bilingual), it
appears that this incompatibility across languages predicts higher ac
curacy (but not speed) in L1. When the languages are decade-unit
compatible, a L1 advantage is not predicted.

Bilingualism onset
Results of the variable of early vs. late onset of bilingualism showed
that a significant difference between languages was characteristic only
of samples involving late bilinguals. While this indicates that a first
language advantage is moderated by late onset of bilingualism, the re
sults do not allow a definitive interpretation of the lack of an effect for
early onset of bilingualism. Given the relatively small number of com
parisons involving early bilinguals, and the fact that many studies did
not report onset of bilingualism and thus could not be included in the
analysis of this variable, the evidence on this variable is incomplete and
no conclusion is warranted without further studies of early bilinguals.

Script differences
This variable did not moderate language differences. That is, when a
bilingual's language pairs differ in script, there is not enough evidence
to suggest that bilinguals are faster or more accurate in their L1. Our
failure to find an effect between different types of script (e.g., English vs.
Chinese) may signal that the way in which we classified this moderator
may not be sensitive enough to detect differences that might exist, and
that other ways of classifying orthographic differences may be called for
in future work. For the present, we tentatively conclude that having to
navigate number verbal codes that differ in how they are written, in
terms of orthography, may not impose additional cognitive demands for
bilinguals, facilitating performance in the first language.

Language shift associated with language of early instruction
Several studies (e.g., Garcia, 2018; Guillaume, 2011; Nishat, 2015)
reporting a language shift tested Spanish-English bilingual samples
coming from the U.S., where Spanish holds a minority-language status.
That is, English is the official language of academics and the workplace
while Spanish is relegated to home and social activities related to it (see
Montrul, 2012). Previous studies suggest that language of instruction
(regardless of L1 and L2 proficiency) predicts language preference for
number use (Vaid & Menon, 2000) and actual performance in number
tasks (Martinez, 2019; Salillas & Wicha, 2012).
We looked at this variable and found qualified support for an effect of
language of early instruction. Our meta-analysis showed that the set of
studies showing no language shift (that is, where the language of early
instruction was the same as the first acquired language) had a relatively
higher statistically significant mean effect size, which was positive in
magnitude. This indicates that a first language advantage was more
likely among participants whose first language was also the language of

Blocked vs. randomized presentation of language
Finally, whether bilinguals are tested with mixed-language trials or
in separated trials blocked by language does not seem, in general, to
affect how they recruit L1 or L2. Although counter-intuitive in nature,
switching between the two languages across experiment trials failed to
account for significant heterogeneity.
The results of our moderator analyses point to individual effects of
number task, degree of second language proficiency, language of early
schooling, language preference for number use, and language pair

14

O. Garcia et al.

similarity on bilinguals' number judgment performance.6 A first lan
guage advantage in number processing appears to be the prevailing
pattern, but its occurrence is more likely the less proficient the bilingual
is in their second language, and if early instruction also takes place in the
first language. Importantly, for bilinguals with more balanced profi
ciency in their two languages, a first language advantage is not
observed. Moreover, when the language of early schooling is not the first
acquired language, a first language advantage is not present to the same
extent, but the evidence does not support a shift to a second language
advantage either. Finally, an L1 advantage is predicted when the task
involves arithmetic computations or judgments and number naming, but
not when it involves magnitude comparisons.
The presence of significant heterogeneity in a number of cases leaves
open the distinct possibility that there may be other factors at play,
perhaps in unique combinations, that could be relevant, but it was not
possible to address different combinations of factors in the present
analysis.

primarily used as the language of academic instruction for the tested
sample population. Not surprisingly, Frenck-Mestre and Vaid (1992;
Experiment 2) found a similar pattern of results among adult SpanishEnglish bilinguals coming from a sample in a Southwest Texas univer
sity. This group showed similar linguistic profiles as Ardila et al.'s
(2019) sample coming from South Florida, also where Spanish is the
relegated language in most cases and is not the language of academics or
government (see Dunn & Fox Tree, 2009), and is instead restricted
mainly to the home setting.
Overall, our meta-analytic findings line up with Bernardo's (1999,
2002) BEC model. That is, one verbal code (L1) appears to show an
advantage over the other language verbal code (L2). The model does not
address part of our finding that bilinguals with equally high proficiency
in L1 and L2 will show similar representational strength across lan
guages. This finding suggests that bilinguals proficient in two languages
may experience some degree of cross-language activation. Namely,
these bilinguals may recruit one language over the other but may not
show substantial differences when prompted to use either language to
complete the verbal format of a given number task. The BEC model also
does not account for the asymmetric effects of number tasks' verbal
requirements.
An important tenet of the BEC is that one code can and will activate
others, in a seemingly spreading-activation fashion (Bernardo, 1999,
2002). If a weaker code will need the activation of a stronger code first,
this suggests some degree of interdependence present even among L1
and L2 codes. There is a condition attached to this: activation of a
weaker code always relies on the activation of a stronger code, but the
reverse may not hold true. This may define a number representational
system whose architecture rests on another important assumption:
stronger-code scaffolding may bring the weaker language up to perform
any given numerical task. Bilinguals may be able to access numerical
representations in the weaker language, but it may come with a latency
and accuracy cost.

Our findings in relation to the bilingual encoding complex model
The BEC model proposed by Bernardo (see Fig. 1) relies on the
parsimonious assumption that verbal codes follow a hierarchical order.
Bernardo's model (1999) may take into consideration L1 and L2 shifting
(i.e., the first learned language being displaced by the later acquired
language) affecting access to number mental representations. The lan
guage showing stronger links to mental representations need not always
be the first learned language (Heredia, 1996, 1997). In fact, Bernardo
(1999, 2001) found that Filipino-English bilingual children showed
number representation superiority in their L2 (i.e., English), which was
6
Despite possible risks of associated low validity (see Harrer et al., 2019) by
overfitting (Higgins & Thompson, 2004) and obtaining false-positive results
from multiple meta-regression (see Iniesta, Stahl, & McGuffin, 2016), we con
ducted separate meta-regression analyses models for moderators like language
proficiency and language preference as well as language proficiency and
number task in the metafor package. These analyses were conducted for both RT
and accuracy. These RT analysis models considering categorical variables of L2
Proficiency, Language Shift, Language Preference, Number Task, Language
Script Type, and Mix/Separate Block Presentation Format did not improve our
model. We opted to leave other categorical variables out to prevent data
overfitting. Comparison between predictor models failed due to unequal out
comes and/or sampling variances in full and reduced models after entering
Number Task, L2 Proficiency, Language Shift, Language Preference, in that
order. Yet the pattern was similar in each of the entered models: Language
Proficiency and Language Shift are the only significant predictors with co
efficients of b = - 0.24 (SE = 0.11; 95% CI = - 0.46, - 0.11; p < .05) and b =
- 0.49 (SE = 0.19; 95% CI = - 0.86, - 0.11; p < .05), respectively. The
regression model reached statistical significance, F (3, 55) = 6.56, p < .001,
explaining R2 = 35.28% of the heterogeneity. These results suggest that Lan
guage Proficiency and Language Shift are negatively associated with effect
sizes. We constructed an accuracy analysis model in the same pattern
(considering the categorical variables of L2 Number Task, Proficiency, Lan
guage Shift, and Language Preference). The best model fit was offered when
Number Task, L2 Proficiency, and Language Shift were included as predictors
with a coefficient of b = - 0.16 for L2 Proficiency (SE = 0.06; 95% CI = - 0.28,
- 0.43; p < .01) and b = - 0.32 for Language Shift (SE = 0.11; 95% CI = - 0.53,
- 0.10; p < .01). The regression model reached statistical significance, F (3, 24)
= 13.34, p < .001, explaining R2 = 73.38% of the heterogeneity. These results
suggest that both Language proficiency and Language Shift are negatively
associated with the effect sizes, even when controlling for Number Task, for
both RT and accuracy.Finally, we ran an extra multivariate model using the
metaSEM (Cheung, 2015) on the 28 studies that report both RT and accuracy.
Covariance was calculated using sensitivity analysis by selecting a correlation
value between RT and accuracy variables ranging from .6 to .9 and settling at r
= .6, after higher values did not have a much different impact. These results
showed a correlation between these two variables of 77% (rRT,ACC = .77).
However, under this model, only accuracy showed a small significant effect size
(d = .17, SE= .06, 95% CI = 0.07, 0.28; p = .002).

Reconciling observed meta-analytic findings
To reconcile the obtained results of this meta-analysis with the BEC
model, we need to consider some important points related to bilin
gualism. First, the literature highlights that bilinguals differ from each
other in important ways and will show different linguistic abilities in
production and comprehension dimensions (see Heredia & Brown,
2013). In effect, we were able to find a distinction based on language
proficiency in how bilinguals with varying degrees of proficiency
perform on number tasks and, by extension, possibly, represent numbers
internally. Second, based on life experiences and other factors (see
Ardila et al., 2019; Chiaro, 2009; Dunn & Fox Tree, 2009; Montrul,
2002; Salillas & Wicha, 2012; Van Rinsveld et al., 2015; Vaid & Menon,
2000), bilinguals will have mismatching home language and language of
academic instruction. We found that this mismatch affected L1 perfor
mance in our model.
Therefore, we propose that it is more appropriate to consider that
bilinguals with similar proficiency across languages may navigate
number mental representations in both L1 and L2 with comparable ease,
possibly depending on the context or language mode they are in (see
Grosjean, 2008) or on the language of the task (see Garcia, 2019;
Jimenez-Jimenez, 2015). The finding of high proficiency across lan
guages and similar number-representation access aligns with Dunn and
Fox Tree's (2009, 2014) and Heredia's (1997) evidence that bilinguals
who show balanced dominance have more comparable lexical repre
sentations across L1 and L2.
Most importantly, it could be argued that high proficiency in L2 does
not speak to the proficiency in bilinguals' L1. It is still not clear whether
both languages may be associated with possible comparable retrieval
mechanisms of number mental representation for both languages, even
if the L1 did not receive complete formal instruction. For example,
Martinez (2019) tested Basque-Spanish proficient in both languages but
15

O. Garcia et al.

Journal of Memory and Language 118 (2021) 104211

who had differential language of instruction in L1 and L2. Results sug
gested faster response favoring language of instruction over the other
language, in a number lexical decision task, but this only occurred under
certain conditions. It may be that when L2 becomes the language of
instruction, these bilinguals may be keeping strong ties to conceptual
representations in their L1 from their own experience at home, buffering
for possible losses.
In the case that no formal instruction is present in L2, bilinguals will
develop a weak verbal number code containing limited mental repre
sentations and thus may rely on the stronger language to compensate
and perform a given number task. Therefore, our interpretation is that
there may be no distinction favoring one language over the other if two
alternate conditions are fulfilled: high proficiency across languages and/
or formal instruction in the L2.

bilinguals may need to reconfigure the operationalization of number
tasks. In particular, it would be important to tease apart number tasks
with an overt language component in production and/or comprehension
from those that do not ostensibly require a language component. It
would also be important to consider dimensions of task not examined
here, e.g., number task complexity or processing load. Third, future
work should investigate bilingual processing of numbers not presented
in verbal format, in relation to numbers presented in L1 or L2 format, to
arrive at a more complete understanding. Fourth, future work is needed
to look at developmental changes in an L1 advantage. Finally, it will be
important in future work to pin down the nature and mechanism of the
L1 advantage found in this meta-analysis. Whether the first language
benefits from some kind of retrieval advantage in number tasks, the
second language is just representationally inferior, or something else is
contributing to the observed effects should be empirically examined.

Applied implications
Prioritizing one language over the other in instruction could be
associated with incomplete or missing conceptual knowledge in the
neglected language (see Montrul, 2002; Schmidt, 2011). We saw a sig
nificant effect size related to delayed retrieval speed, but not accuracy,
in basic number tasks, and so an instructional shift to L2 may still
potentially decrease skills acquisition in the L1. Fostering dual educa
tional assessment and pedagogical programs, at least in basic arithmetic
and number fact knowledge, might not affect language development in a
negative manner. On the contrary, it could enhance representational
codes and access strategies when performing in either language.

Conclusion
This systematic review summarizes >40 years of research into
bilingual mental number representations focusing on studies that
examined speed of performing number computations or judgments (and
associated accuracy). Findings provide clear evidence that not only does
language matter in how bilinguals access and represent number facts but
also that a bilingual's proficiency as well as language shifts brought
about by language of instruction shape number representations, which
in turn may determine the speed and accuracy of number fact retrieval.
More generally, our findings support and extend existing bilingual
number processing models by showing that heterogeneity in bilinguals'
language experience differentially affects their number processing.

Limitations
One potential limitation of this study is that we restricted our anal
ysis to numbers presented in verbal format only. We acknowledge that
by not including numbers presented in digit format we are restricting the
generalizability of our findings. We understand most uses of numbers
involve numbers presented in digit format, or at least, in digit format in
interaction with verbal format. Given that our research ques
tion--looking at moderators of L1 vs. L2 differences in number proc
essing--informed our decision to focus on number words, we are not in a
position to say anything about how bilinguals' number processing
operates for digits in interaction with number words.
Another important limitation arises from our potentially restrictive
inclusion criteria and moderators. For example, this meta-analysis only
looked at RTs and their associated accuracy rates but not accuracy when
it was the sole outcome variable in bilingual number performance. The
fact that we only looked at accuracy responses from speeded trials
under-represents the range of results we could have considered had we
not had this restriction.
With respect to our choice of moderator variables, there are many
others we could have selected that could have been interesting and
informative. We could not include many of these because there were not
enough studies. Examples are language training effects (Kraut & Pixner,
2020; Spelke & Tsivkin, 2001), between-language switching costs (from
L1 to L2 and vice-versa, Grabner, Saalbach, & Eckstein, 2012), carryover
effects (how performance in one language affects performance in
another), numeral system properties, and cultural differences in in
struction or practice of number skills (see Campbell & Xue, 2001).

Future directions
There are various directions for future research to complete the
picture provided by the results of our meta-analyses. First, future
research should collect more evidence on bilinguals showing high pro
ficiency in both languages but number representation asymmetries
across languages as reported by Martinez (2019). Whether this effect
could interact with the language of instruction needs more clarification
as well. Second, future syntheses of the number cognition literature in
