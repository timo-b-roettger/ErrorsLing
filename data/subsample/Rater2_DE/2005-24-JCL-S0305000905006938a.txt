ABSTRACT

Properties of the input, such as raw frequency and syntactic diversity,
have been shown to play a role, to different extents, in the acquisition
of nouns and verbs. This study investigated the relationship between
three properties of the input (input frequency, syntactic diversity, and
variety in noun-type co-occurrence) and age of acquisition of English
adjectives. In addition, this study explored the relationship between
adjectival semantic typology and order of acquisition. The data are
7262 child utterances and 6318 maternal utterances containing one
of 272 adjective in the language samples of two children, Sarah and
Adam, from age 2; 3 to 5; 0 (Brown, 1973) available in CHILDES
(MacWhinney, 2000). Statistical analyses revealed that all three
properties of the input were significantly correlated with age of
acquisition, but variety in noun-type co-occurrence was not a significant
predictor once input frequency and syntactic diversity were taken into
account. Semantic analyses revealed that the distribution of adjective
types and tokens differed between the children and the mothers (to an
extent) when the data were examined in terms of adjectival semantic
types. The results suggest that both properties of the input and
the semantic properties of the English adjective class play a role in its
acquisition.

INTRODUCTION

Determinants of the order of acquisition of words and grammatical constructions continue to be a major focus of developmental psycholinguistic
research. In the area of lexical acquisition, a number of factors have been
proposed to play a role in the order of acquisition of both lexical categories
and individual words.
Properties of the input are one such set of factors. Input frequency has
been invoked to account for the order of acquisition of nouns and verbs (e.g.
Brown, 1958 ; Tardif, Shatz & Naigles, 1997 ; Naigles & Hoff-Ginsberg,
1998) and so has positional salience (Goldfield, 1993 ; Tardif et al., 1997). In
addition, with regard to the acquisition of verbs, proponents of syntactic
bootstrapping have argued that the more syntactic frames a verb in the input
occurs in, the earlier the verb will be acquired (Gleitman, 1990; Naigles &
Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998). Finally, the distribution of lexical items in the input
might influence their acquisition. Sandhofer, Smith & Luo (2000) report
that a steep distribution (i.e. many tokens of a few types) characterized
verbs in their input data whereas a flat distribution (i.e. many types with
a modest frequency) characterized nouns and argue that differences in
distribution might promote different kinds of learning for different word
classes.
Properties of the words themselves have also been invoked to account for
their order of acquisition. Word-to-world mapping properties of words
may come into play during lexical acquisition. The noun-bias observed in
children's early lexicons, for example, has been explained by positing that
` children come to language with already formed concepts of objects, based
on their interactions with objects in the real world' (Nelson, Hampson &
Shaw, 1993 : 62). In a similar vein, Gentner (1982 : 321) argues that the
noun advantage in children's early lexicons cannot be explained by
properties of the input ; instead, ` nouns are learned earlier because their
referents are more accessible than those of predicates. ' Researchers
have also argued that semantically simple verbs are easier to acquire than
semantically complex verbs (e.g. Pinker, 1989) as are semantically
simpler dimensional adjectives compared to more complex ones (Blewitt,
1982).
Finally, cognitive and communicative predilections of the child may also
be a determining factor in lexical acquisition. The child's agency in the
word learning process is at the center of L. Bloom's intentionality model (L.
Bloom, 2000). L. Bloom (2000 : 27) argues that engagement and relevance
are vitally important in lexical acquisition. In this view, of the numerous
words children hear each day, ` the words they will learn are those that are
relevant to the persons, objects, events, actions, states, relationships, and
the like that they do care and know about and that are, therefore, the objects
of their engagement. '

ACQUIRING THE ENGLISH ADJECTIVE LEXICON

In sum, these studies suggest that a combination of different factors may
influence the order of acquisition of nouns and verbs, including their
structural, distributional, and semantic properties as they interface with
young children's communicative and cognitive predilections.
Much less is known about the factors which might influence the acquisition of adjectives. One reason adjectives have been neglected in the lexical
acquisition literature may be that they are proportionately few in children's
early productive lexicons. In addition, studies have applied different criteria
when including early words in this category. The `descriptive words '
category, which consists primarily of adjectives, in the MacArthur
Communicative Development Inventories, for example, includes the expression all gone (Fenson, Dale, Reznick, Bates, Thal & Pethick, 1994). The
labels for this class have also varied (e.g. ` property words ', `descriptive
words ', and ` descriptors'). Yet, even with this limitation in mind, studies
seem to agree that this category of words is indeed small in early productive
lexicons, constituting only 9-10 % of children's first 50 words (Nelson,
1973 ; Benedict, 1979). Large-scale cross-sectional checklists confirm this
finding. Only 9% of words in the MacArthur Communicative Development
Inventories are ` descriptive words ' (Fenson et al., 1994). The size of the
adjective class does not seem to change proportionately beyond the 50-word
boundary. In fact, it seems to decrease. Bates, Bretherton & Snyder (1988)
found that at age 1; 6, approximately 7% of children's lexicons consisted of
adjectives, and at 2 ; 4, only 5.5 % of children's productive lexicon consisted
of adjectives. Adjectives seem to be also proportionately rarer in the input.
Sandhofer et al. (2000) found that less than 20% of parental words of
English-speaking caregivers in their data were ` descriptors' (approximately
10% when measured in tokens and approximately 18 % when measured in
types), and their relative frequency remained stable in the input to children
ages 0; 11 to 2; 11. Experimental studies have failed to show robust evidence
of adjective learning by two-year-old children (Gelman & Markman, 1985 ;
Taylor & Gelman, 1988 ; Hall, Waxman & Hurwitz, 1993). The adjective
class seems to also be in the periphery of linguistic research. One possible
reason is that a large, open adjective class (i.e. a class which can grow by
means of word creation processes) is not a language universal. In fact, some
languages have no adjective class at all, others have small, closed adjective
classes ranging from 7 to 50 members, while others, like English, have large,
open adjective classes (Dixon, 1982).
However, the adjective class is of particular interest to the debate
surrounding the factors influencing lexical development because adjectives
share some semantic properties with nouns and with verbs. In fact, in
languages without a large adjective class adjectival concepts are expressed
by means of nouns or verbs (Dixon, 1982). In addition, according to
Wierzbicka (1986), adjectives are semantically similar to nouns because they
537

BLACKWELL

both denote properties. Their difference lies in the number of properties
each denotes. A noun, such as bird in the expression This is a bird, denotes
the set of bird properties, whereas an adjective, such as pretty in the
expression The bird is pretty denotes a single property. Yet, the English
adjective class is also syntactically and semantically distinct from nouns and
verbs. English adjective phrases occur within a noun phrase (prenominally,
e.g. I see a pretty bird, and in much more constrained ways postnominally,
e.g. I see something pretty) or within a verb phrase (e.g. The bird is pretty,
I painted the house red). The semantic typology of adjectives also distinguishes adjectives from other word classes. Dixon's (1982) crosslinguistic
analysis of the adjective class revealed that the adjectives of languages with a
large, open adjective class can be classified in terms of a common
semantic typology with the following semantic types : DIMENSION (e.g. big,
small, long, short, wide), PHYSICAL PROPERTY (e.g. hard, soft, smooth, rough),
COLOUR (e.g. red, blue, green), HUMAN PROPENSITY (e.g. jealous, happy,
intelligent), AGE (e.g. new, old, young), VALUE (e.g. good, bad, excellent), SPEED
(e.g. fast, slow). Dixon's analysis relies on the premise that lexical
items belong to distinct semantic groupings or `semantic types ', such as
MOTION (go), AFFECT (hit, cut), OBJECT (stone, tree), DIMENSION (large, deep),
etc. According to Dixon, each semantic type has a strong association
with only a single word class within a given language. The English
adjective class is, therefore, also semantically distinct from the noun and
verb classes.
Despite this unique status of the English adjective class, little is known
about the acquisition of this word class as a whole (e.g. Prasada, 1992 ;
Blackwell, 1998). Much less is known about the factors which might play a
role in their order of acquisition. The goal of this study, therefore, is to
explore the relationship between two sets of factors (input properties and
the semantic properties of the English adjective class) and the order of
acquisition of English adjectives.
Which properties of the input might play a role in the order of acquisition
of adjectives ?
One obvious candidate is input frequency. A number of studies have
shown that input frequency appears to play a significant role in the order
of acquisition of nouns (e.g. Brown, 1958) and verbs (e.g. Naigles &
Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998). It seems plausible to suppose, therefore, that input
frequency might also play a role in the acquisition of adjectives.
A second candidate is syntactic diversity. Syntactic diversity has been
shown to play a role most clearly in verb acquisition (e.g. Gleitman, 1990 ;
Naigles & Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998). Proponents of syntactic bootstrapping
have argued that the more syntactic frames a verb appears in, the more it is
distinguished from other verbs, and, as a result, the more transparent its
meaning becomes to the child. Unlike verbs, however, English adjectives do
538

ACQUIRING THE ENGLISH ADJECTIVE LEXICON

not occur in alternating syntactic environments as a result of their meaning.
The majority of English adjectives can occur in all adjectival syntactic
positions (e.g. He is a happy boy, The boy is happy, I know how to make him
happy, I see someone happy). It is the rare exception for an adjective to be
limited in its syntactic distribution (e.g. *the afraid boy). Yet, it seems
plausible that syntactic diversity may influence the order of acquisition of
adjectives because a more diverse syntactic distribution of an adjective in
the input provides the child with more evidence that the word is indeed an
adjective (as opposed to a noun, a verb, or an adverb, for example).
Experimental studies have shown, in fact, that syntactic cues help children
distinguish adjectives from nouns (e.g. Taylor & Gelman, 1988 ; Hall et al.,
1993). Thus, syntax in the case of adjectives might not function as a zoom
lens (Gleitman, 1990) but as a cue to category membership, and as
such might play a role in promoting adjective learning by young children
(P. Bloom, 2000).
In addition, this study investigates how one more input property - variety
in noun co-occurrence - might relate to adjective learning. For one thing,
the interpretation of many English adjectives depends on the nouns they
modify. Specifically, adjectives enter into two types of modification
relationships with nouns : categorematic and syncategorematic (for a review
of the literature, see Frawley, 1992 : 446-64). In the case of categorematic
modification, an adjective's meaning is independent of the noun it modifies,
as in the examples blue car, blue shirt, blue shoes (objects which are all blue
irrespective of the nature of each entity modified). In syncategorematic
modification, by contrast, the adjective depends on the noun for its
interpretation, as in the examples good car, good shirt, good shoes (in which
good may have a number of different interpretations depending on the noun
modified ; for example, a good car may be a car which runs well whereas a
good shirt may be a shirt worn in special occasions). It seems plausible to
suppose that the more diverse the child's exposure to adjective-noun
combinations, the more robust the evidence for the child regarding both the
adjective's meaning and its application and, consequently, the earlier it
might be acquired. In addition, raw frequency of adjective use does not
capture the number of DIFFERENT modification relationships in which an
adjective may enter, each of which may provide the child with additional
clues regarding the meaning of the adjective. This study, therefore,
examines whether diversity of adjective-noun co-occurrence, measured in
terms of the number of noun types with which an adjective appears in the
input, might also play a role in adjective learning.
In sum, previous theoretical and empirical work suggests that three
properties of the input are likely relevant factors in relation to order of
acquisition of adjectives : frequency, syntactic diversity, and variety in noun
co-occurrence.

BLACKWELL

This study aims to determine the relationship between these input factors
and the order of acquisition of adjectives. In addition, by presenting a
detailed picture of the acquisition of over 100 adjectives in the longitudinal
data of two children ages 2; 3 to 5 ; 0, this study aims to fill the gap in our
understanding of the acquisition of the adjective class - with a special focus
on its semantic typology.

METHOD

Subjects
This study analyses the adjective lexicon in the language transcripts of
Adam and Sarah (Brown, 1973) available on the CHILDES database
(MacWhinney, 2000). At the beginning of the data collection, Adam and
Sarah were matched for the length of their utterances (in terms of MLU
and in terms of the length of their longest utterance) and for chronological
age (2 ; 3). The corpus consists of 133 transcripts of Sarah's language,
each a half-hour in length, collected weekly from age 2;3 to 4 ;11, and 54
transcripts of Adam's language, one-hour in length, from age 2 ;3 to 4 ;11,
collected bi-weekly from age 2 ; 3 to 4 ; 0 and monthly starting at age 4;0.
The children were audio-recorded in their homes while playing with their
mothers and occasionally interacting with the investigators and other family
members.
These language samples which span several years of development (ages
2 ; 3 to 5; 0) were selected for analysis because adjectives, as a class, appear
late in children's lexicons (Bates et al., 1988). Naturally, using language
samples to study lexical acquisition remains problematic given that not
all words in a child's productive lexicon are produced during periodic
one-hour recordings of his/her language. Yet, these data were considered
appropriate for the purpose of this study because its focus is the nature of
the relationship between child and maternal adjective use. In these samples,
the same objects and events served as the focus of attention for the mothers
and their children, and the differences in the adjectives used to describe
these objects and events by children and their mothers are of particular
value in determining the relationship between maternal adjective use and
the order of acquisition of adjectives by the children.
Procedure
An adjective search list of 272 adjectives was used to create the corpora of
child and maternal adjective utterances. The list, which appears in the
Appendix, includes all the adjectives in the MacArthur Communicative
Development Inventory : Toddlers (Fenson et al., 1994) and in a random
sample of 20 of Adam and Sarah's language transcripts. In addition, it
540

ACQUIRING THE ENGLISH ADJECTIVE LEXICON

includes the top 100 adjectives in the Leech, Rayson & Wilson (2001)
frequency list (with the exception of adjectives such as British which were
considered inappropriate for inclusion). Finally, it includes the adjectives in
the transcripts of Laurel (at 2.7 MLU), Isadora (at 3.3 MLU), Helen (at
4.3 MLU), and Susan (at 4.7 MLU) from the Studies in the Acquisition of
Communicative Competence project (Masur & Gleason, 1980) available on
the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). Unlike the Brown data,
these transcripts were of speech recorded during a variety of discourse
contexts (during play and storybook reading with the mother, during play
and storybook reading with the father, and during dinner) and, as a result, a
variety of semantic types of adjectives were likely to be used. Using this
adjective list, Adam's and Sarah's transcripts were searched with the kwal
command of the CLAN programme. Four corpora were created, one for
each child and mother. All utterances containing adjectives used as proper
nouns (e.g. Busy Bulldozer, New York) or in memorized routines (e.g.
Happy Birthday song) were excluded as were instances of words which
belonged to a different lexical class (e.g. I like orange juice best, Warm it up).
Speech corpora and coding
Data. The children's data are 4299 adjective utterances produced by
Adam and 2963 adjective utterances produced by Sarah. The mothers'
data are 2501 adjective utterances produced by Adam's mother and 3817
adjective utterances produced by Sarah's mother.
Coding. Each utterance was coded to indicate the adjective, its semantic
class (following Dixon, 1982), its syntactic position (e.g. prenominal,
predicative, postnominal), the noun modified, and the child's age and MLU
for the language file in which the utterance occurred.1
The semantic coding reflects the meaning of the adjective most appropriate
in the context in which the adjective was used in a given utterance. Using
Dixon's (1982) typology, the adjective strong, for example, was coded as a
HUMAN PROPENSITY adjective when used to modify an animate referent, as in
the utterance (by Adam's mother) I don't think you're quite strong enough to
blow a tree down, and as a PHYSICAL PROPERTY adjective when used to modify
an inanimate referent, as in the utterance (by Adam's mother) That balloon
is strong. In addition, since the PHYSICAL PROPERTY and HUMAN PROPENSITY
categories are large (Dixon, 1982) and include a diverse set of properties of
objects and humans, these two categories were further subcategorized and
coded following primarily Frawley (1992) (see Table 1). Frawley's classification excludes PHYSICAL PROPERTY adjectives expressing properties related to
[1] Some coded aspects of the data are not discussed in this paper. A discussion of the
syntactic development of the adjective phrase appears in Blackwell, 2000.

ACQUIRING THE ENGLISH ADJECTIVE LEXICON

wetness and cleanliness ; therefore, three separate subcategories for WETNESS,
CLEANLINESS, and APPEARANCE (pretty, ugly, cute, beautiful) were added to
make the analysis comprehensive. In addition, a FORM category was added
to account for adjectives such as round, straight, flat, square following Roget
(1965). Adjectives classified as OTHER in Dixon's taxonomy were further
subcategorized following Frawley (1992) and Roget (1965) (see Table 1).
The child data were coded by the author, and the mothers' data were
coded by two assistants following training by the author. To ensure
reliability, 10 % of the adjective utterances from a random sample of transcripts were coded independently by a fourth coder. Agreement between
coders based on that sample was 95% calculated on an utteranceby-utterance basis.
Input properties. Input frequency was measured in terms of the
cumulative number of adjective tokens in each mother's corpus. Syntactic
diversity was measured in terms of the number of syntactic environments in
which the adjective occurred in maternal utterances (0-3). The syntactic
environments established for this analysis were prenominal attributive
position (e.g. the big truck), predicative position (e.g. the truck is big), and
other (i.e. postnominal position, e.g. Give me something big ; object complement position, e.g. I painted it red). Adjectives received a score of 0 for
syntactic diversity when they only occurred in one-word utterances (e.g.
Funny!). Variety in noun co-occurrence was measured in terms of the
number of noun types each adjective modified in the input.
In a study of the relationship between input and lexical acquisition it is
difficult to establish that maternal language is not itself influenced by child
lexical use. To investigate this possibility, pairwise correlations between the
two mothers on all input measures (for the 76 adjectives which were used by
both of the mothers and their children and which serve as the data used in
the input analyses) were calculated, following the methodology in Rowland,
Pine, Lieven & Theakston (2003). All correlations were significant suggesting that maternal adjective use was similar between the two mothers and
thus less likely to have been influenced strongly by their children's adjective
use (adjective frequency r=0.876, p<0.001 ; frequency of adjective use in
prenominal position r=0.901, p<0.001 ; frequency of adjective use in
predicative position r=0.718, p<0.001 ; frequency of adjective use in other
syntactic positions r=0.300, p<0.01; number of noun types modified by
adjective r=0.785, p<0.001). A proportional analysis of these input
properties examining the mothers' frequency patterns of adjective use with
regard to each input property in more detail makes an even more convincing
case that the ways in which the two mothers used their adjectives
were largely similar (see Table 2). These similarities suggest that
maternal adjective use is, at least to a certain extent, independent of the
children's.

RESULTS

General findings
Sarah produced 118 adjective types with a mean frequency of 24.62
(S.D.=48.05, range=1-346) and 2963 adjective tokens. Sarah's mother
produced 151 adjective types with a mean frequency of 22.64 (S.D.=46.34,
range=1-314) and 3817 adjective tokens. Nine of Sarah's adjective types
were not produced by her mother, and 42 of her mother's were not produced by Sarah.
Adam produced 143 adjective types with a mean frequency of 25.86
(S.D.=48.78, range=1-368) and 4299 adjective tokens. Adam's mother
produced 131 adjective types with a mean frequency of 15.40 (S.D.=31.28,
range=1-214) and 2501 adjective tokens. Twenty of Adam's adjective types
were not produced by his mother, and 8 of his mother's were not produced
by Adam.
Order of acquisition of adjectives
Of the 272 adjectives on the search list, 76 adjectives serve as the data for the
analyses exploring the relationship between input and order of acquisition.
These are the adjectives which were produced by both Adam and Sarah and
which met a second use acquisition criterion (see below) for both children.
To determine the order of acquisition of adjectives, a second use criterion
was applied to ensure that the adjectives were not frozen items in the
544

ACQUIRING THE ENGLISH ADJECTIVE LEXICON

children's lexicons. Adjectives were considered acquired when they
occurred - in utterances which did not directly imitate a maternal adjective
utterance - with two different nouns (the criterion employed by Mintz
& Gleitman, 2002) or in two different syntactic positions. Based on this
criterion, an age of acquisition was established for each of the adjectives in
each child's data (see Table 3 which indicates the age acquisition of each
adjective for each child).
By 2; 6, the children had acquired 8 adjectives : big, little, red, good, broken, cold, pretty, and poor. Between 2; 6 and 3 ; 0, the two children acquired
16 common adjectives while individually Adam acquired an additional 25
and Sarah an additional 3 adjectives. In the 3; 0 to 4;0 age period, the two
children acquired 18 common adjectives, and individually Adam acquired
an additional 22 and Sarah an additional 7. By 4;0, Adam also acquired 2
adjectives already acquired by Sarah by age 3;0, and Sarah acquired 15
adjectives already acquired by Adam by age 3 ; 0. The 4;0 to 5;0 age period
shows the least development. Both children acquired 5 common adjectives,
and individually Adam acquired an additional 11 adjectives and Sarah
acquired an additional 8. By 5; 0, Sarah also acquired 9 adjectives already
acquired by Adam, and Adam acquired 4 adjectives already acquired by
Sarah.
Of the 76 common adjectives, 11.4 % were acquired by the two children at
the same age, a further 14% were acquired within a month of each other, a
further 9 % within two months, a further 6 % within three, and a further
11.4 % within four months of each other. In total, 52% were acquired by the
two children within four months of each other, 54 % within 6 months, and
72% within 10 months of each other. Adam acquired the majority of the
common adjectives earlier than Sarah. However, even in light of this
difference in the developmental rate of adjective acquisition between the
two children, the order of acquisition was significantly correlated (r=0.531,
N=76, p<0.0005).
Input properties and the order of acquisition of adjectives
The next analyses investigated the relationship between the three properties
of the input (frequency, syntactic diversity, and variety in noun-type
co-occurrence) and the order of acquisition of adjectives by the two children
(see Table 4 for descriptive statistics on all the variables).
In the first analysis, the age of acquisition of adjectives was correlated
with input frequency, syntactic diversity, and noun-type diversity (see
Table 5). There was a significant negative correlation between age of
acquisition and each of the input characteristics suggesting that all three
properties of the input play a role in the order of acquisition of adjectives.

data ; see Table 6) was conducted to determine the relative contribution of
each input property to the age of acquisition of individual adjectives.
Note that in addition to the three input properties, child adjective
frequency of use was included in the predictor variables in the regression
analysis (following the methodology in Rowland et al., 2003) to evaluate the
possibility that order of acquisition is not confounded with frequency of
use, especially given that many of the adjectives that were acquired earliest
were also the ones produced more frequently by the children (age of
acquisition and frequency of use were correlated in the data : Adam r=
x0.441, p<0.001; Sarah r=x0.542, p<0.001). If this were the case,
child frequency would likely surface as a significant predictor of age of
acquisition.
The regression results reveal that only two predictors - input adjective
frequency and input syntactic diversity - were significantly related to age of
acquisition accounting for 33.5% of the variance in Adam's model
(F(2, 73)=18.38, p<0.001) and about 37 % of the variance in Sarah's model
(F(2, 73)=21.25, p<0.001) (see Table 7). Once the effects of input frequency
and syntactic diversity were removed, noun type diversity and child
frequency of use were not significant predictors for either child.
It is noteworthy that input frequency accounted for a larger portion of the
variance in Adam's model whereas syntactic diversity accounted for a larger
portion of the variance in Sarah's model. To investigate this finding,
pairwise correlations of these two factors for the adjectives common to the
two mothers were performed. Frequency of use was more strongly

correlated (r=0.876, N=76, p<0.001) than was the variety of syntactic
environments in which the adjectives occurred (r=0.337, N=76, p<0.005).
In fact, the mothers shared their highest frequency adjectives (with over
100 tokens) which included the adjectives big, little, good, nice (additionally,
Sarah's mother used new and Adam's mother careful over 100 times in these
data). By contrast, individual adjectives appeared in different combinations
of syntactic environments in the data of the two mothers, possibly as a
result of the specific discourse preferences of each mother. Sarah's mother,
in fact, used a larger proportion of her adjectives in three syntactic positions
(see Table 2), and this distribution possibly explains why Sarah's regression
model favoured syntactic diversity over input frequency.

The semantics of the English adjective class and order of acquisition
These regression results, though statistically significant, suggest that input
properties account for only a portion (approximately 35%) of the variation
in the criterion variable in the case of both children. What other factors
might play a role in the order of acquisition of adjectives?
One factor which has been proposed to account for the order of
acquisition of other lexical classes is the semantic properties of the words
themselves (e.g. Blewitt, 1982 ; Pinker, 1989). The following analyses,
therefore, explore the relationship between the semantic properties of the
adjective class and the order of acquisition of adjectives.
The data in these analyses include ALL the children's adjectives which
met the second use criterion (whether or not they were used by both
children) and ALL the adjectives used by their mothers (whether or not they
were used by their child). The age of acquisition of each adjective was
established based on the second use criterion. Child adjective use (types and
tokens) is also examined in terms of six stages in development (measured in
terms of age) to investigate the relationship between the children's cognitive
predilections and order of acquisition.
The development of adjectival semantic categories
The age of acquisition of adjectives in terms of adjectival semantic types
appears in Table 3.
549

BLACKWELL

Table 3 reveals that from as early as age 2;4, most of the semantic
categories were represented, if only by one adjective, in both children's
productive adjective lexicons : DIMENSION, COLOUR, VALUE, PHYSICAL
PROPERTY, HUMAN PROPENSITY, OTHER.
By age 3 ; 0, the two children produced the majority of the COLOUR
adjectives included in the search list (see the Appendix). Following the
appearance of a COLOUR adjective in a transcript of the two children, a burst
of COLOUR adjectives characterized the following month or two. This finding
confirms earlier studies of the acquisition of colour terms (e.g. Carey &
Bartlett, 1978; Andrick & Tager-Flusberg 1986).
The remaining semantic categories grew across the three age periods as
follows.
DIMENSION and VALUE adjectives appeared by age 3;0 and followed a
general-to-specific acquisition pattern. By 2 ; 4, the more general DIMENSION
adjectives big and little were acquired, followed by tall (acquired by Adam
at 3 ; 1 and by Sarah at 4 ; 2), long and short (acquired by Adam at 3;4 and
4 ; 10 respectively). This pattern of acquisition follows that observed in
experimental findings on the acquisition of dimensional adjectives (e.g.
Bartlett, 1976; Clark, 1993). Similarly, the more general VALUE adjectives
appeared by age 3 ; 0 (good, bad, and nice) followed by adjectives expressing
degrees of value (wonderful, great, terrific, terrible, awful) most of which
were acquired between the ages of 4; 0 and 5;0.
Several subcategories of PHYSICAL PROPERTY adjectives appeared in the 2 ;0
to 3 ; 0 age period : CONFIGURATION (broken, stuck), SUBSTANTIALITY (heavy),
SENSE (dark, quiet), WETNESS (wet), TEMPERATURE (hot, cold), CLEANLINESS
(dirty, messy), APPEARANCE (pretty). By 4; 0, additional members of these
subcategories were produced by the children as were members of the
following subcategories : TEXTURE (sticky), CONSISTENCY (soft), FORM (flat),
EDIBILITY (sweet).
HUMAN PROPENSITY adjectives of all three semantic subcategories appeared
as early as age 3 ; 0. They included MENTAL STATE adjectives (happy, crazy,
afraid, nervous), PHYSICAL STATE adjectives (tired, hungry, healthy) and
BEHAVIOUR adjectives (ready, funny, naughty). The 3;0 to 4;0 age period was
characterized by the addition of mostly PHYSICAL STATE adjectives (sick,
dead, blind, asleep, sleepy) and BEHAVIOUR adjectives (busy, silly, friendly).
The 4; 0 to 5; 0 age period was characterized by the acquisition of additional
MENTAL STATE adjectives (intelligent, smart, wise, glad).
It seems, then, that the pattern of acquisition of members of different
adjectival semantic categories follows a fairly similar pattern for the two
children (though the age of acquisition of specific adjectives is clearly
different since Adam acquired more adjectives than Sarah and acquired
most common adjectives earlier than Sarah). To examine this finding
further, the next analyses explore child adjective use (in terms of semantic
550

ACQUIRING THE ENGLISH ADJECTIVE LEXICON

typology) as a function of age, drawing a comparison between the two
children and their mothers. If children's cognitive predilections are at play
in adjective acquisition, then the children's production of adjectives in
terms of semantic categories might differ from that of the mothers and
might vary as a function of age.
Use of adjectives in terms of semantic category membership in relation to
child age
For these analyses, the data are the child and maternal adjective utterances
drawn from two hours of recorded speech at six developmental stages (ages
2; 6, 3; 0, 3 ; 6, 4 ; 0, 4; 6, and 5; 0).2 Two analyses, one on adjective types
and one on adjective tokens, were performed using the mean number of
adjective types and tokens belonging to each semantic category (6 semantic
categories) for the two children and the two mothers (2 speaker groups) at
each age period (6 age periods). A three-way mixed ANOVA on adjective
types (2 speaker groups, 6 age periods, 6 semantic categories) where speaker
group was a between-subjects factor and age periods and semantic
categories were within-subjects factors yielded a significant main effect
for semantic category (F(5, 10)=11.105, p<0.005) and a significant interaction between semantic category and speaker group (children vs. mothers)
(F(5, 10)=3.26, p<0.05). A three-way mixed ANOVA (2 speaker groups, 6
age periods, 6 semantic categories) on adjective tokens yielded a significant
main effect for age (F(5, 10)=8.709, p<0.005), a significant main effect for
semantic category (F(5, 10)=8.702, p<0.005), and a significant interaction
between semantic category and speaker (F(25, 50)=1.810, p<0.05).
The differences in adjective use between the children and their mothers
in terms of semantic types appear in Figure 1 (for adjective types) and
Figure 2 (for adjective tokens). In terms of adjective types (see Figure 1),
the children used more COLOUR and PHYSICAL PROPERTY adjective types than
their mothers in these transcripts, and this pattern did not change with age.
The mothers used a larger variety of VALUE adjective types. It should be
noted that the small proportion of AGE adjectives is the result of the small
number of AGE adjective types comprising this semantic subcategory (new,
old, young, fresh).

the age of acquisition of adjectives (measured in terms of a second use

criterion). Three input properties were evaluated in this study : adjective
frequency, syntactic diversity, and variety in noun-type co-occurrence.
A second goal of this study was to fill the gap in our knowledge on the
acquisition of English adjectives as a class, focusing primarily on the
development of semantic subcategories of the English adjective class.
Earlier studies have either focused on one semantic subcategory of the
adjective class (e.g. Bartlett, 1976 ; Andrick & Tager-Flusberg, 1986) or on
fast-mapping experiments with small numbers of novel adjectives (e.g. Hall
et al., 1993 ; Waxman & Markow, 1998 ; Klibanoff & Waxman, 2000; Mintz
& Gleitman, 2002). By contrast, this study explored the pattern of
acquisition of over 100 adjectives based on two children's longitudinal data
spanning ages 2; 3 to 5 ; 0.
The major findings are the following :
(1) First, for both children, all three properties of the input (input
frequency, syntactic diversity, diversity in noun type co-occurrence) were
significantly correlated with order of acquisition. However, only adjective
frequency and syntactic diversity were significant predictors of age of
acquisition in the regression model ; once the effects of these two factors
were removed, diversity of noun co-occurrence was not a significant predictor of age of acquisition.

Input frequency has been shown to be important in the acquisition of
nouns and verbs (e.g. Brown, 1958 ; Tardif et al., 1997; Naigles & HoffGinsberg, 1998). Input frequency seems to play some role even in the
acquisition of larger structures (see, for example, Rowland et al., 2003, for
the effect of frequency on the acquisition of wh-questions). It is not
surprising that it would also play a significant role in the acquisition of
adjectives, especially in light of their semantic content. Given the number
of likely property concepts an unfamiliar adjective might encode, it seems
that a single exposure in naturally occurring maternal speech would likely
not include sufficient information regarding the meaning of the adjective for
a child to map it successfully to the appropriate concept. In fact, given that
adjectives express only one property of a given object compared to the set of
properties encoded by nouns (Wierzbicka, 1986), the task of mapping a
property to an object (given the numerous options) becomes complex.
Thus, when a child hears That cat is pretty, the child is unlikely to map
pretty to a property such as furry which is inherent to cats (and thus within
the set of cat properties). The child, however, is still faced with a complex
mapping task given that pretty in that utterance (without contextual clues)
could mean ` chubby ', ` frisky ', ` cross', ` anxious', etc. Fast mapping
experiments have shown that children are, in fact, more successful in
553

BLACKWELL

mapping novel adjectives to properties when the properties are applied to at
least two objects from the same basic level category which compare or
contrast with respect to a property (Waxman & Klibanoff, 2000). An
examination of the maternal data in this study suggests, however, that in
naturally occurring language to children, mothers do not systematically
present unfamiliar adjectives in this manner (preliminary coding for contrastive uses of adjectives in maternal speech reveals that less than 3% of
such utterances occur in these data). In the absence of explicit and successive contrastive uses, it seems high frequency plays that role in naturally
occurring language to children.
The second predictor in our model, syntactic diversity, has been shown
to play a role most clearly in verb acquisition (e.g. Gleitman, 1990 ; Naigles
& Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998). The significant relationship between syntactic
diversity and age of acquisition observed in this study suggests that syntactic
bootstrapping may be relevant to the acquisition of adjectives as well - only
in a different way. In the case of adjectives, the more adjectival syntactic
positions an adjective occurs in, the more transparent its lexical status might
become to the child. Syntactic cues may be especially important in the
acquisition of adjectives in light of the fact that the syntactic distribution of
English adjectives is characteristic of the adjective class alone (Huddleston
& Pullum, 2002 : 528). Experimental studies have shown, in fact, that
syntactic cues help children distinguish adjectives from nouns (Taylor &
Gelman, 1988; Hall et al., 1993). For example, Taylor & Gelman (1988)
found that two-year-olds make more property interpretations when a novel
word occurs in an adjectival position (e.g. This is a zav one) and more object
interpretations when the novel word appears in a nominal position (e.g. This
is a zav). This significant role syntactic cues seem to play in the acquisition
of adjectives might, in fact, explain the late appearance of many members of
this word class (likely in addition to the fact that their learning is largely
` parasitic on the noun vocabulary ' as argued by Mintz & Gleitman,
2002 : 273).
Given the role nouns seem to play in the acquisition of adjective meaning,
it seems surprising that variety in noun-type co-occurrence was not a significant predictor in the regression model. It is important to note, however,
that raw frequency and diversity in noun-co-occurrence were very strongly
correlated (Adam's mother r=0.865, p<0.001 ; Sarah's mother r=0.905,
p<0.001). That is, the more frequently adjectives were used, the more noun
types they modified in the input. It is likely for this reason that noun-type
diversity surfaced as a redundant predictor in the regression analysis once
frequency of use had been taken into account. Experimental studies might
be more successful in teasing apart frequency and diversity in noun-type
co-occurrence. Fast mapping experiments have shown that children are, in
fact, more successful in mapping novel object properties successfully when

the properties are applied to at least two objects from the same basic level
category which compare or contrast with respect to this property (e.g.
Waxman & Klibanoff, 2000). Note, however, that most studies of this
nature rely on physical properties (e.g. objects covered in bumps, wire,
etc.), and, as a result, novel adjectives in such research are categorematic in
nature. It remains an empirical question, therefore, to determine how many
DIVERSE contexts (i.e., how many different noun types co-occurring with an
adjective) are necessary for acquiring the meaning of adjectives which are
syncategorematic in nature (such as VALUE and HUMAN PROPENSITY
adjectives ; see Frawley, 1992, for a detailed discussion of the relationship
between semantic type and the categorematic vs. syncategorematic nature of
modification).
Finally, a potential concern with correlational studies of this kind is that
the direction of statistically significant relationships remains unclear. It is
possible, for example, that the adjectives appearing frequently in the input
(and likely in more diverse syntactic positions) seem to be the ones acquired
early precisely because the mothers might be more inclined to use more
frequently the words that their children know. Our data, however, do not
support this conclusion. A case in point is COLOUR adjectives. As a class,
they were acquired early (by 3; 0) and were frequently used by the children
but not by the mothers (see Table 8). In fact, of the 15 most frequent
adjectives, 5 were COLOUR adjectives in Adam's (red, blue, green, black,
yellow) and in Sarah's data (red, blue, black, green, pink) whereas only 2 COLOUR
adjectives (red and green) made that list in Adam's mother's data and only 1
(blue) in Sarah's mother's data. In addition, the general profile of child
and maternal adjective use differed with regard to the number of adjective
tokens produced, especially in Adam's case. Adam produced 4409 adjective tokens compared to his mother's 2501. This finding suggests that the

discourse style of mothers and children with regard to adjective use differs
and deserves a closer study. Finally, the two children's adjective frequency
was, in fact, more strongly correlated (r=0.901, p<0.001) than was the
frequency of maternal and child adjective use for the 76 common adjectives
(frequency correlation between Adam and his mother r=0.890, p<0.001 ;
frequency correlation between Sarah and her mother r=0.835, p<0.001).
(2) The second finding in this study is that the way children experience
adjectives in the input is likely not the sole factor influencing adjective
acquisition. Examining the children's order of acquisition of adjectives
in terms of the semantic typology of the adjective class revealed that it
followed a fairly similar pattern of acquisition of members of different
semantic types (see Table 3). In fact, more than half of the common
adjectives (52 %) were acquired within 4 months by Adam and Sarah. In
addition, the statistical analyses of type and token use across 6 developmental stages revealed that the productive adjective lexicon of the children
in contrast to the mothers varied significantly at each age period with regard
to the number of adjective types used belonging to each semantic category.
In addition, the size of each semantic category varied significantly between
children and mothers. That is, even in light of a shared discourse context,
child and maternal adjective use differed with respect to the number of
different adjective types and adjective tokens of each semantic category
produced in a given transcript. By contrast, no significant differences in the
semantic pattern of adjective type production were found in these data as a
function of the children's stage in development (measured in terms of age).
Finally, the proportional distribution of adjective tokens of different
semantic types suggests that the children used their adjectives differently
from their mothers (the case is strongest for Sarah with regard to COLOUR
and HUMAN PROPENSITY adjectives; see Table 9 which shows cumulative
tokens by semantic type across all transcripts).
A number of researchers have argued that the semantic properties of the
noun class (in contrast to the verb and adjective classes) give it an advantage
556

ACQUIRING THE ENGLISH ADJECTIVE LEXICON

in lexical acquisition. In her discussion of the noun advantage, Gentner
(1982), for example, argues that it is not the result of input frequency :
verbs, she argues, have a higher token frequency with a relatively small
number of types whereas nouns have a high type frequency with a low token
frequency. If input frequency played a role in lexical acquisition, she
argues, we would expect verbs, with their high token frequency, to be more
heavily represented in children's early lexicons. After examining frequency,
word order, morphological transparency, and patterns of language teaching
as possible factors in the creation of the noun advantage, Gentner (1982 :
321) concludes that ` nouns are learned earlier because their referents are
more accessible than those of predicates. ' The findings of the semantic
analysis conducted in this study suggest that the semantic properties of the
adjective class may also play a significant role in its acquisition. One such
property, the distinction between categorematic and syncategorematic
modification, may be of particular relevance here (for a summary, see
Frawley, 1992). In categorematic modification (e.g. red scarf), the meaning
of the adjective can be computed separately from that of the noun. In
syncategorematic modification (e.g. good student), it is essential to compute
the meaning of the noun in order to determine the precise meaning of the
adjective (i.e. good as a student but possibly bad as a person). The findings
suggest that the adjectives which enter into categorematic modification
relationships with the nouns they modify are the ones acquired early and used
frequently by Adam and Sarah, e.g. COLOUR adjectives, the semantic type
considered the prototypical case of categorematic modification (Frawley,
1992 : 461). Though the conclusion remains tentative based on the findings
of this study, it is clear that the relationship between the semantic properties of the adjective class and its acquisition deserves closer scrutiny.
Finally, two more observations deserve mention. First, though this study
did not address the discourse function of children's adjectives in these data,
it is noteworthy that the distinct impression one gets examining the child
adjective utterances in contrast to their mothers' is that children use their
adjectives to a large extent to identify or comment on objects in their
environment (e.g. there a red pencil, it be a big snowman, my cheese sandwich
hot, it's too messy). What is striking about the mothers' adjective use is the
number of evaluative contexts in which their adjectives appear (e.g. Adam,
you are a very good cook; they're nice; I think that you have it the wrong way;
it just plays nice music ; this is terrific). Second, the steep distribution of
adjectives in the input deserves some discussion. Recall that Sandhofer et al.
(2000) observed a steep distribution of verbs in the input compared to a flat
distribution of nouns. The present study supports their conclusion that
possibly a steep distribution provides children with the necessary number of
experiences to provide sufficient evidence regarding the meaning of words
which are more abstract in nature. Their argument, made with regard to
557

BLACKWELL

verbs, seems to extend to the adjective class, especially with regard to those
semantic types which ` denote subjective reaction and sensation ', such as
VALUE and HUMAN PROPENSITY adjectives (Frawley, 1992 : 460). To end with
an example, consider the adjective funny. Since the use of the adjective
funny (in its sense ` humorous ') often co-occurs with laugher, Adam, for
example, seems to use funny (until the age of 3;0) either when he or
someone else is laughing or when he drops something. In response, his
mother repeatedly asks him, What's funny about that ?, suggesting that his
use of funny is inappropriate from the adult perspective. To comprehend
funny, a child has to recognize that it is often used when something seems
humorous only to the person using the adjective. Not only multiple
exposures to the adjective, but also a developed theory of mind (P. Bloom,
2000) seems relevant to the acquisition of an adjective such as this one.
More research on the converging factors playing a role in adjective learning
is clearly warranted.

CONCLUSION

Using longitudinal data to draw conclusions about lexical acquisition is
naturally problematic. The children may have produced additional
adjectives at times when they were not being recorded. However, even in
light of this limitation, this study offers valuable insights into the acquisition of English adjectives as a class and demonstrates convincingly that its
acquisition deserves closer study.
