Abstract
The response-signal speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) procedure was used to investigate how proactive interference
(PI) affects retrieval from working memory. Participants were presented with 6-item study lists, followed immediately
by a recognition probe. A variant of a release from PI design was used: All items in a list were from the same semantic
category (e.g., fruits), and the category was changed (e.g., tools) after three consecutive trials with the same category.
Analysis of the retrieval functions demonstrated that PI decreased asymptotic accuracy and, crucially, also decreased
the growth of accuracy over retrieval time, indicating that PI slowed retrieval speed. Analysis of false alarms to recent
negatives (lures drawn from the previous study list) and distant negatives (lures not studied for 168+ trials) suggests
that PI slowed retrieval by selectively eliminating fast assessments based on familiarity. There was no evidence indicating that PI affected slow processes involved with the recovery of detailed episodic information.

Introduction
The successful execution of complex cognitive skills
often requires gaining access to the products of prior perceptual and cognitive analyses. Whenever these products
are outside the span of focal attention, they must be
retrieved from either working memory or from more
durable long-term memory representations. A major
determinant of successful retrieval is the amount of interference in the retrieval context (e.g., Anderson & Neely,

the contribution of fast assessments of familiarity, without concomitant effects on the recovery of specific episodic information, which occurs later in retrieval.
Classic PI effects
Peterson and Peterson (1959; see also Brown, 1958)
presented participants with a verbal item for 500 ms
and found that recall accuracy decreased as the retention
period was increased across an 18-s interval. Using the
same procedure, Keppel and Underwood (1962) found
that recall accuracy declined as the number of study
items increased when, crucially, the retention interval
was held constant. They concluded that forgetting could
be induced by the buildup of PI alone. The results indicated a sharp difference in proportion correct between
the first and second trials in all retention intervals (3,
9, and 18 s). This finding provided the first systematic
evidence implicating PI as a major determinant in recall,
and it suggests a single trial is sufficient to produce PI.
``Release from PI'' phenomena (Watkins & Watkins,
1975; Wickens, 1970) demonstrate that the effect of PI
on memory is a function of the psychological similarity
of the interfering material to the target item. For
instance, when items from the same category are presented for several trials, PI gradually builds up. If items
from a different category are then presented, PI is ``released'' in that performance returns to its original level
(Watkins & Watkins, 1975). There are two broad classes
of explanations for this phenomenon. One claims that
the buildup and release effects of PI results from factors
related to memory encoding. According to this view,
changing the nature of the items results in better encoding (Watkins & Watkins, 1975; Wickens, 1970). The
alternative explanation posits that PI affects retrieval.
According to this view, items could be equally well
encoded in memory, but they become increasingly difficult to retrieve with increasing PI. Changing the type of
items provides unique retrieval cues, which then results
in more efficient retrieval. Watkins and Watkins (1975)
dubbed this view the ``cue overload'' explanation,
suggesting that the efficiency of a retrieval cue decreases
as the number of items it selects increases.
Several findings suggest that PI selectively affects
retrieval, with little or no effect upon memory encoding
or storage. For instance, Gardiner, Craik, and Birstwistle (1972), using a cue overload paradigm (e.g., Watkins
& Watkins, 1975; Wickens, 1970), presented participants
with words from a subset of a category (e.g., garden
flowers) during the build up trials and then switched to
a complementary subset (e.g., wild flowers) on the
release trial. All participants received the general category name (e.g., flower) as a cue at presentation in the first
trial but not in the following buildup trials. On the
release trial, one experimental group received the subset
cue (e.g., wild flowers) before the presentation, another

127

experimental group received the cue at retrieval, and
the control group did not receive any cue. Both the
experimental groups showed similar amounts of release
from PI. The control group did not show the release
effect, which provided evidence that participants were
not aware of the subcategory distinction during encoding. Crucially, the comparable release effects for the
two experimental groups suggest that PI impacts on
retrieval rather than encoding. Watkins and Watkins
(1975) report findings that point to a similar conclusion.
They showed that the build up of PI across 3 same-category lists did not affect recall performance in a final
cued recall task, where participants were given the category names as a recall cue and asked to recall all items
from the three lists. Again, this suggests that the lists
were equally well encoded, and that PI effects occurred
during retrieval of the individual lists. Finally, Tehan
and Humphreys (1996) demonstrated that PI effects
occurred as a function of the uniqueness of retrieval cues
(unique cues providing release from PI) when encoding
conditions were otherwise equal.
Collectively, these studies suggest that PI has its primary effect on retrieval (but see Chechile & Butler, 1975
& Chechile, 1987, for arguments that PI may also induce
changes in encoding). However, research has not clearly
identified how PI negatively impacts on retrieval processes. A fundamental question we sought to address
was whether PI simply decreases the likelihood of
retrieving an item from memory or whether it also
affects the dynamics of retrieval, slowing retrieval as it
builds.
Effects of PI on retrieval
Most investigations of PI have used recall tasks.
However, there is substantial evidence that PI also negatively affects recognition performance (e.g., Gorfein &
Jacobson, 1972, 1973; Petrusic & Dillon, 1972). Because
the production of an item not presented at retrieval may
involve a series of operations to resample memory, possibly using modified sets of cues (e.g., Raaijmakers &
Shiffrin, 1981), recall may be a less than optimal task
for investigating how PI affects basic retrieval operations. We examined recognition performance to more
directly assess how PI adversely affects the likelihood
and speed of accessing memory representations.
An additional feature of most standard investigations
of PI is that they typically measure PI after a filled retention interval (e.g., distractor task), and hence primarily
assess the effects of PI on recall from long-term memory.
However, interference is operative in tasks such as language comprehension (e.g., Fedorenko, Gibson, &
Rohde, 2006; Gordon, Hendrick, & Levine, 2002; Lewis,
Vasishth, & Van Dyke, in press; Van Dyke & Lewis,
2003; Van Dyke & McElree, 2006) and problem solving
(e.g., Altmann & Trafton, 2002), which typically rely on

128

the products of very recent perceptual and cognitive processing and little or no distracting activity has occurred
prior to retrieval. To explore the effect of PI on recently
processed information, we investigated its effect on the
immediate recognition of items from a list of six sequentially presented items, with no distractor task between
study and test. We examined recognition performance
for each serial position to assess the effects of PI on items
typically thought to be within working memory span
(viz., serial positions 4-6; Cowan, 2001) and less recent
items that may be beyond the limited span of working
memory (viz., serial positions 1-3). Our analyses focused
on both the speed and accuracy of recognition as a function of PI. We discuss how PI might affect both aspects
of recognition within the context of current approaches
to recognition.
Single process approaches
Many recognition models assume that a single directaccess, or content-addressable, retrieval operation mediates item recognition (see Clark & Gronlund, 1996). In
these frameworks, contextual cues contact memory representations without the need for a search through irrelevant memories, and recognition judgments are based
on a global assessment of the match between the recognition probe and representations in memory. Current
evidence suggests that a direct-access mechanism
mediates the recognition of information held in both
short- and long-term memory. Although retrieval from
short-term representations was once thought to involve
a specialized search process (e.g., Sternberg, 1975;
Theios, 1973; Treisman & Doctor, 1987), detailed measures of the dynamics of retrieval in tasks such as probe
recognition indicate that both short- and long-term
memories are recovered with the same type of directaccess mechanism (e.g., McElree, 1996, 1998, 2006; McElree and Dosher, 1989, 1993; Wickelgren et al., 1980). A
summary of this evidence is presented in McElree (2006).
If, as in recall, PI decreases the effectiveness of a set
of retrieval cues used to access representations in memory, making it less likely that the cues will provide direct
access to the relevant representation, then we would
expect it to lower recognition accuracy. However,
certain ways of reducing the effectiveness of retrieval
cues might also slow the comparison process, slowing
the overall recognition of an item.
As an illustration, consider the diffusion model,
which represents what is perhaps the most fully articulated and tested general model of the speed and accuracy
of basic comparison processes, applicable to both shortand long-term memory judgments (e.g., Ratcliff, 1978;
Ratcliff, Van Zandt, & McKoon, 1999). In Ratcliff's
(1978) treatment of recognition in tasks such as probe
recognition, accuracy is determined by the degree of
match between retrieval cues at test and the current state
of the memory representation. Degree of match is

represented as a mean resonance value between retrieval
cues and the set of items in a particular condition. Higher resonance values lead to a higher probability of
retrieval. If PI lowers resonance, following a cue overload or related principle, then it will lower the probability that a retrieval probe resonates with an element in
memory, decreasing the overall accuracy of the judgment. Retrieval speed is conceptualized as the rate at
which evidence accrues over time. It is unaffected by differences in mean resonance, which instantiates the principle that a content-addressable operation enables
memory representations of differing quality to be
retrieved with comparable speed. However, Ratcliff
(1978) demonstrated that differences in the variance of
the resonance values across conditions can engender differences in the rate of information accrual: Specifically,
higher variance can produce faster rates of accrual, with
other parameters held constant. In this framework, PI
might affect retrieval speed if it decreases the variance
of the distribution of resonance values, perhaps by
attenuating high values.
Dual-process approaches
Several alternative approaches propose that recognition judgments can sometimes be mediated by information other than a global match between the probe and
memory. Dual-process theories assume that recognition
reflects a mixture of judgments based on familiarity and
recollection (e.g. Atkinson & Juola, 1974; Jacoby, 1991;
Mandler, 1980; Yonelinas, 1994, 2002). Familiarity can
be viewed as a global assessment of the probes match
to items in memory, whereas recollection is often conceptualized as a different process, one that is based on
the recovery of more specific episodic information
(e.g., source information; Jacoby, 1991; McElree,
Dolan, & Jacoby, 1999; Yonelinas, 2002). Dual processes are often thought to underlie the recognition of items
in long-term memory, but several studies indicate that
they may also be operative in the retrieval of short-term
representations (McElree, 1996, 1998, 2001; McElree &
Dosher, 1989).
Dual-process approaches raise the possibility that PI
might selectively affect one process only, or that it might
affect the two processes in different ways. Jacoby, Debner,
and Hay (2001) used the process-dissociation procedure
(e.g., Jacoby, 1991) to estimate the effects of PI on familiarity and recollection in a fragment completion task.
Participants were first given pairs of related words in a
training phase, in which one word was paired with two
associates (e.g., ale-beer and ale-brew). To manipulate
PI, Jacoby et al., varied the frequency with which words
were paired together in this training phase (75, 50, or
25% of the time). The training phase was followed by a
study phase, in which participants were given one of the
pairs to study (e.g., ale-brew). In a final test phase,
participants were given a fragment (e.g., ale-b_e_) and

I. Oztekin, B. McElree / Journal of Memory and Language 57 (2007) 126-149

instructed to complete it with the word that was presented
in the study phase. Process-dissociation logic was used to
derive estimates of how familiarity stemming from the frequency manipulation in the training phase and recollection of the specific pairs presented in the study phase
jointly contributed to performance on the fragment completion task. Interestingly, Jacoby et al., found that PI
affected the estimates of familiarity only. The familiarity
estimates showed evidence of probability matching, in
that they were nearly equal to the frequencies in the training phase. This pattern suggested to Jacoby et al., that PI
did not lower the likelihood of recollecting the pairs from
the study phases but only functioned as a form of bias
when recollection failed. That is, prior learning exerted
its influence on performance only when participants failed
to recover specific episodic information from the study
phase. In these cases, participants incorrectly completed
the fragment in a manner consistent with prior training,
and the frequency of doing so approximately matched
the amount of prior training.
The experimental protocol used by Jacoby et al. (2001)
differs in many ways from a classic cue overload paradigm, and there is no compelling reason to assume that
results from this type of task will generalize to the operations that are used in simpler recognition tasks. Nonetheless, the results raise the intriguing possibility that PI may
selectively affect the recovery of different forms of information on which recognition can be based.
In a classic cue overload paradigm, PI could selectively reduce the diagnosticity of a general assessment
of familiarity or it could selectively impair the recovery
of source information. In either case, it would lower
the overall recognition accuracy, which in most circumstances is thought to rely on a mixture of the two forms
of information. PI might also directly slow the retrieval
of either type of information, in ways analogous to what
was outlined in the section above. Interestingly, however, several studies, discussed more fully below, have
demonstrated that the two forms of information are
retrieved with different time courses. Familiarity information has been found to be available before source
and other more specific episodic information (e.g., Curran, 2000; Hintzman & Curran, 1994; McElree, 1998,
2001; McElree et al., 1999; McElree & Dosher, 1989).
This raises the possibility that PI could affect retrieval
speed by simply altering the relative contribution of each
type of information. For example, if PI selectively lowers
the diagnosticity of familiarity information, it might
slow overall retrieval speed because participants would
be less able or less inclined to rely on relatively fast
assessments of familiarity, and their judgments would
have to wait upon slower accruing episodic information.
In the reported work, we used an experimental procedure that conjointly measures retrieval speed and accuracy to assess how PI affects recognition, and we
employed manipulations that enabled us to separately

129

estimate effects of PI on the recovery of familiarity and
more specific episodic information.
The present study
Measuring the effect of PI on retrieval speed and accuracy
Reaction time (RT) paradigms are often used to
investigate potential differences in the speed of memory
retrieval. However, RT is not a pure measure of retrieval speed. Although, barring speed-accuracy tradeoffs,
there is little doubt that a difference in retrieval speed
will be reflected in RTs, the converse does not necessarily follow: We cannot infer a difference in retrieval
speed from a difference in RT, because differences in
the quality of the match between the probe and the
memory representation alone can affect RT even if
the underlying speed of information accrual is constant
(e.g., Dosher, 1976, 1981; McElree & Dosher, 1989;
Murdock, 1971; Ratcliff, 1978; Wickelgren, 1977; Wickelgren, Corbett, & Dosher, 1980). As PI is thought
to affect the quality of the memory match, differences
in RT do not entail that PI affects retrieval. What is
required is a procedure that enables separate assessments of probability and speed of correctly identifying
a recognition probe.
To conjointly measure the effects of PI on recognition speed and accuracy, we used an SAT variant of
a probe recognition task (e.g., McElree, 1996, 1998;
McElree & Dosher, 1989; Reed, 1976). Fig. 1 illustrates
the basic procedure: participants studied 6-word lists,
which were immediately followed by a recognition
probe. We used an immediate test, rather than having
a long retention interval and a distracter task between
study and test, to directly measure effects of PI on representations that vary in recency over the short-term.
Crucially, participants were cued to respond to a
response signal (a tone) presented at 43, 200, 300,
500, 800, 1500 or 3000 ms after the onset of the recognition probe, and they were required to respond within
100-300 ms of the tone. Varying the response signal
across this range of times enabled us to measure the
full time-course of retrieval, from times when accuracy
was at chance to times when accuracy reached its
asymptotic level.
General effects of PI on accuracy and retrieval dynamics
Fig. 2 illustrates how we induced PI. For three consecutive trials, participants received three lists from the
same semantic category. After the third trial, a different
category was used for the next three trials, and so on
throughout a session of the experiment. We expected
PI to build up across the three trials using the same category and to be released when the category was
switched. We assessed the effects of PI on the full
time-course of retrieval by comparing functions from
the three consecutive same-category trials.

The asymptote of the SAT time-course function provides a measure of overall recognition accuracy. Based
on previous findings (e.g., Gorfein & Jacobson, 1972,
1973; Petrusic & Dillon, 1972), we expected that PI
would impact on recognition accuracy, and hence that
it would lower the SAT asymptotes across the three lists
as it builds. Our primary interest was in retrieval dynamics. Retrieval speed is jointly measured by when accuracy first departs from chance, the intercept of the SAT
function, and the rate at which accuracy grows from
chance to asymptote, the SAT rate. If PI slows retrieval,
then it should either shift the SAT intercept towards
longer times or slow the growth of accuracy over retrieval time. In either case, SAT functions will display disproportional dynamics: That is, the functions will reach a
given proportion of their respective asymptotes at different times. Disproportional dynamics, whether due to
differences in either intercept or rate, indicate underlying
differences in either the rate of continuous information
accrual if retrieval is continuous or the distribution of
finishing times if retrieval is discrete (Dosher, 1976,
1979, 1981, 1982, 1984; Meyer, Irwin, Osman, &
Kounois, 1988; Ratcliff, 1988).
Proactive interference has not been investigated with
the SAT method, but there are indications that other
forms of interference may affect retrieval speed. Dosher
(1981) used an SAT procedure to investigate associative
interference. Participants studied a series of word pairs
that either contained an interference relation (AB, DE,
and AC) or did not (AB, DE, and FC). At either a short
delay or a long delay, they were presented with a word

pair to recognize. Asymptotic accuracy was lower for
pairs with interference relations. Additionally, however,
associative interference appeared to slow retrieval speed
(SAT rate), although the effects were moderate and did
not reach significance.
Effects of PI on serial position
We also assessed how PI varies with recency within
each of the three consecutive lists. Positive test probes
were drawn equally often from each of the six serial
positions in a list, which enabled us to derive a timecourse function for each serial position. Studies of
retrieval dynamics in the probe recognition task
(McElree, 1996, 1998; McElree & Dosher, 1989, 1993;
Wickelgren et al., 1980) have shown that asymptotic
accuracy displays typical bowed serial position functions, with accuracy decreasing as the probe is drawn
from more remote serial positions coupled with a small
primacy advantage for the first position. In contrast,
however, retrieval speed does not vary with recency
but rather shows a sharply dichotomous pattern.
Retrieval speed is exceptionally fast for the last item or
group of items studied, with all other positions being
slower and associated with the same speed. The retrieval
advantage for the last chunk is thought to reflect the fact
that it remains active in focal attention when no mental
activity intervenes between study and test (see McElree,
2006 for a review of the evidence for this claim). Because
the test probe can be matched to the contents of focal
attention, no retrieval operation may be required for this
type of trial. An analysis of the serial position functions

enabled us to examine whether the effect of PI was operative across all items in a list or whether it was restricted
to only cases that require retrieval. The former may be
the case if PI affects encoding. However, if PI primarily
affects retrieval, then we would not expect it to influence
cases where the probe could be directly matched to items
in focal attention.
Effects of PI on familiarity and recollective processes
Finally, we sought to examine the potential effects of
PI on familiarity and the recovery of more specific episodic information. We did so by isolating the retrieval

time-course for each type of information. The two types
of information are often highly correlated, and factors
(repetition, recency, etc.) that lead to high familiarity
values also lead to detailed recovery of episodic and
source information. Hence, it can be difficult to uniquely
identify the contribution of each type of information to
any overall judgment. However, the two forms of information can be isolated by placing them in opposition to
one another, such that one provides evidence antithetical
to the evidence provided by the other (e.g., Jacoby, 1999;
McElree, 1998; McElree et al., 1999; McElree & Dosher,
1989).

132

I. Oztekin, B. McElree / Journal of Memory and Language 57 (2007) 126-149

One means of doing so is to examine false alarm (FA)
rates to lures that vary in their recency (e.g., McElree,
1998, 2001; McElree & Dosher, 1989) or other factors
that affect an item's familiarity (e.g., repetition, McElree
et al., 1999). In a probe recognition task, recent lures will
have a higher FA rate than more distant lures, presumably because they have higher familiarity due to more
recent study. Crucially, previous SAT studies have found
that recent lures engender FA rates that are non-monotonic across retrieval time. For example, in a probe recognition task, McElree and Dosher (1989) found that,
relative to temporally distant lures (negative probes
drawn from 3 or more trials back), lures that were members of the previous study list induced high FA rates early
in retrieval (response-signal times < 900 ms), suggesting
that recent lures had higher familiarity. With additional
retrieval time (response-signal times > 900 ms), FA rates
for recent lures decreased, approaching the level
observed for distant lures. These non-monotonic FA
functions were argued to result from an early, fast assessment of familiarity, which was attenuated later in retrieval by the recovery of list--specific information.
Hintzman and Curran (1994) reported a related pattern in an SAT study that contrasted easy and difficult
item discriminations, where difficult discriminations
required participants to reject the plural form of a word
that was studied in a singular form. Consistent with
McElree and Dosher (1989), they found that difficult
lures produced high FA rates early in retrieval that were
attenuated later in retrieval. McElree (1998) extended
these findings by showing that both episodic familiarity
and semantic similarity intrude early in the course of
recognizing items from categorized lists. Recently studied lures and lures from the semantic categories studied
in the list both produced high FA rates early in retrieval
when compared against a baseline FA rate for less
recently studied, semantically unrelated lures. Finally,
in an experimental design following Jacoby (1999),
McElree et al. (1999) found a similar FA profile for lures
repeated for either 3 or 5 times versus lures presented
only once.
The biphasic FA functions provide relatively direct
evidence for the retrieval of two types of information
(see McElree et al., 1999). Minimally, these results indicate that information on which recognition judgments
are based shifts from a general assessment of familiarity
early in retrieval to more specific episodic information
later in retrieval. Dual-process approaches to recognition interpret this pattern as reflecting the contribution
of two distinct processes, namely a familiarity process
and a recollective process. Event-related brain potential
(ERP) research has provided additional support for the
two-process interpretation of these biphasic FA
functions by demonstrating unique ERP components
associated with the early and late phases of the SAT
time-course functions (Curran, 2000).

That the same type of biphasic retrieval functions are
found in paradigms using small list sizes and immediate
recognition tests (e.g., McElree & Dosher, 1989) as in
other paradigms with longer lists (McElree, 1998) and
delayed tests (e.g., Hintzman & Curran, 1994; McElree
et al., 1999) suggests that dual processes are operative
in both short- and long-term recognition. This claim is
generally consistent with other evidence indicating that
the same type of retrieval mechanism mediates the
recognition of both short- and long-term events (see
McElree, 2006).
In the current experiment, we used two types of negative conditions to examine the potential effects of PI on
familiarity and the recovery of source information.
Analogous to McElree and Dosher (1989), we presented
participants with recent negatives (RN), which were
lures that were members of the previous study trial,
and distant negatives (DN), which occurred at least
168 trials back. If PI affects familiarity, differences
should emerge early in retrieval. Conversely, if PI affects
the retrieval of more specific episodic information, then
differences should emerge later in retrieval. Specifically,
if PI selectively influences familiarity, then we would
expect the high FA rate early in retrieval typically found
with RNs to diminish as PI builds up across the three trials. Alternatively or additionally, if PI impacts on the
recovery of more specific episodic information, then it
should affect the degree to which this information attenuates the high FA rates for RNs later in retrieval.

Method
Participants
Eight students from New York University participated in the study. Each participant completed 14 105-min
sessions, and an additional 15-min practice session to
train for the SAT procedure. One participant was affiliated with the lab, and volunteered her time. All remaining participants were paid for their time.
Materials
The stimuli consisted of 21 instances of 56 categories.
We used all categories from the category norms of Van
Overschelde, Rawson, and Dunlosky (2004) that had 21
or more instances, supplementing these with a few experimenter-generated sets.
Design and procedure
Stimulus presentation and response collection were
controlled by a personal computer. For each 3-trial
sequence, which we will refer to as a set, a category
was pseudo-randomly selected from the 56 categories.

I. Oztekin, B. McElree / Journal of Memory and Language 57 (2007) 126-149

A category was not repeated until a set from all 56 categories was presented (a total of 168 trials). For each trial in the set, a study list was constructed by randomly
selecting (without replacement) 6 words from 21 words
of the category. Positive probes were drawn from one
of the 6 serial positions of the current study list equally
often. For List 2 and List 3, half of the negative probes
were distant negatives (DN), and half were recent negatives (RN). DNs were selected from members of the
same category, but were studied at least 168 trials back.
RNs were selected randomly from the 6 serial positions
of the previous trial. List 1 trials use DNs only, since
they involved the first presentation of a category.
Each participant performed 14 sessions. Each session
consisted of 756 trials divided into three blocks, yielding
84 sets (three trials each) per block. For the positive conditions, this resulted in a total of 42 trials at each of the
seven response deadlines (lags) for each of the 6 serial
positions per list. For the negative conditions, there were
252 DN trials per lag for List 1, 126 DN trials per lag for
List 2 and List 3, and 126 RN trials per lag for List 2 and
for List 3.
Fig. 1 illustrates that the sequence of events in a single trial was as follows: (a) A centered, solid square fixation point was presented for 500 ms. (b) Study words
were presented successively for 500 ms each. (c) After
the presentation of the last study word, a mask consisting of non-letter symbols was presented in the same
region as the study list for 500 ms. (d) Following the
mask, the test word was presented at the same region
as the study list and the mask. The test word remained
on the screen for the duration of the lag. (e) At 43,
200, 300, 500, 800, 1500 or 3000 ms after the onset of
the test item, a 50-ms tone sounded to cue the participants to respond. (f) Participants gave a yes-no recognition response as quickly as possible after the onset of the
tone by pressing a key. (g) After the participant responded, feedback was given on the participant's latency to
respond. Participants were trained to respond within
300 ms of the tone. They were informed that responses
longer than 300 ms were too long and that responses
under 100 ms were anticipations, and that both should
be avoided. (h) Following the latency feedback, the participant was asked to give a confidence rating ranging
from 1 to 3 (``3'' indicating strong confidence, ``1'' indicating weak confidence). The confidence ratings primarily served as means of enabling participants to self-pace
themselves through the trials. They were not analyzed
further. Participants initiated the next trial by pressing
a key. Participants were allowed to rest between blocks.

the false alarm rates to distant negatives (DN) to obtain
(equal-variance Gaussian) d 0 measures. To ensure d 0 s
were measurable, perfect performance in any condition
was adjusted with a minimal corrections procedure:
Hit rates higher than .99 were adjusted to .98, and false
alarm rates lower than .01 were adjusted to .02. This
adjustment approximates the correction suggested by
Snodgrass and Corwin (1988). This correction was
necessary for approximately 7% of the trials to obtain
measurable d 0 s.
Analysis of time-course data has typically been conducted on d 0 measures, to avoid possible distortions of
the shape of the functions caused by response biases.
To demonstrate that the results reported below were
not particular to the d 0 transform, we performed analogous fits on the (untransformed) proportion correct data
for the individual subjects' and the average (over subjects) data.1 The results are reported in Appendix A
and show the same effects found in the d 0 analyses.
The Appendix also includes a table which reports the
average hits, false alarm, and proportion correct data
corresponding to the d 0 analyses reported below.
Because collecting enough data to derive stable functions for each of the 8 subjects required running each
subject for 25.5 h, one could be concerned that subjects
might have adopted radically different response strategies across the 14 sessions. To examine this issue, we collapsed and compared the data for the first half (the first
7 sessions) and the second half (the remaining 7 sessions)
of the experiment for each participant. A 2 (1st or second half of sessions) * 3 (list) * 8 (lag) repeated measures ANOVA conducted on the proportion correct
data (averaging over serial position) for each list and
per lag revealed a significant effect of list,
F (2,14) = 9.640, p < .01. As is documented below, this
list effect reflects the build up of PI across the 3 lists.
There was a marginal effect of session, F (1,7) = 4.610,
p < .069, and a significant session by lag interaction,
F (2,14) = 2.573, p < .05. The significant interaction
was due to lower accuracy scores in the second half of
the sessions than the first half at longer interruption lags.
This could have arisen from the fact that motivation
declined across the sessions, but it could also reflect
the long-term build up of PI as the categories and exemplars became increasingly more familiar. Crucially, however, there was no indication of an interaction of list and
session (p < .01). This lack of an interaction indicates
that PI effects were consistent across sessions.

We performed all analyses except fits of the dual-process
model. We could not fit a dual-process model to the proportion
correct data because it required anchoring the fits of the false
alarm functions to the corresponding proportion correct
functions, which unfortunately are on a different scale.

Consequently, we report below analyses that use the

Asymptotic accuracy
We averaged the d 0 s for the last two interruption lags
to obtain an empirical measure of asymptotic recognition accuracy (e.g. McElree & Dosher, 1989, 1993;
McElree, 1998, 2001). Fig. 3 shows the average asymptotic d 0 for six serial positions of the three lists
(Fig. A1 in the Appendix A shows the analogous proportion correct functions). A 3 (list) * 6 (serial position)
repeated-measures ANOVA conducted on the asymptotic d 0 s indicated that accuracy increased significantly
as the test probe was drawn from more recent serial
positions, F (5,35) = 37.551, MSe = 7.456, p < .01. Main
effect of list was marginally significant, F (2,14) = 2.958,
MSe = .394, p < .085. This is not surprising since Fig. 3
shows that PI has decreased accuracy for the first three
serial positions, but not for the more recent serial
positions.
To confirm that PI impacted more on less recent serial positions, we conducted an interaction contrast for
the effect of list within each serial position. The results
revealed that PI significantly decreased accuracy for serial position 1, F (2,14) = 7.17, MSe = .23, p < .01 and
serial position 2, F(2,14) = 4.19, MSe = .22, p < .05.
The more recent serial positions did not show a significant decrease in accuracy (p > .1). The post hoc comparisons between the lists were not significant for either
serial position 1, p > .1, or serial position 2, p > .1. PI's
effects on asymptotic accuracy on lists, and on separate
serial positions will be discussed further in the analysis
of the SAT curve fits.
Retrieval dynamics

participants' data and the average data (d 0 values aver-

In Eq. (1), d (t) is the predicted d at time t; k is the
asymptotic accuracy level reflecting the overall probability of recognition; d is the intercept reflecting the discrete
point in time when accuracy departs from chance
(d 0 = 0); b is the rate parameter, which indexes the speed
at which accuracy grows from chance to asymptote. Previous studies have shown that this equation provides a
good quantitative summary of the shape of the SAT
functions (e.g., Dosher, 1981; McElree, 1996, 1998,
2001; McElree & Dosher, 1989, 1993; Wickelgren &
Corbett, 1977; Wickelgren et al., 1980).
Retrieval dynamics within lists
To verify that SAT functions within each list showed
the same essential pattern that has been observed in
other studies (e.g., McElree, 1996, 1998; McElree &
Dosher, 1989, 1993; Wickelgren et al., 1980), the SAT
functions for the 6 serial positions within each list were
fit with sets of nested models that systematically varied
the three parameters of Eq. (1). These models ranged
from a null model in which all functions were fit with
a single asymptote (k), rate (b), and intercept (d) to a fully saturated (18-parameter) model in which each function was fit with a unique asymptote (k), rate (b), and
intercept (d). The quality of the fits was examined by
three criteria, which have been used in prior research
(e.g., Dosher, 1981; McElree, 1996, 1998, 2001; McElree
& Dosher, 1989, 1993; Wickelgren & Corbett, 1977;
Wickelgren et al., 1980): (1) The value of an adjusted
R2 statistic, which reflects the proportion of variance
accounted for by a model, adjusted by the number of
free parameters (Reed, 1973); (2) The consistency of
the parameter estimates across participants; (3) Evaluation of whether the fit yielded systematic deviations that
could be accounted for by additional parameters.
Models that did not allocate separate asymptotes (ks)
for serial positions produced poor fits to the empirical
SAT data. Allocating separate ks to each serial position
increased the adjusted-R2 from .76 to .96 in List 1; from
.70 to .93 in List 2; from .67 to .95 in List 3 on the average data. Comparable differences were seen in the individual fits of all participants' data. However,
consistent with prior studies, there was also clear
evidence for dynamics differences. These differences were
due to fast rising functions for serial position 6. A 6k-2b1d model provided the best fit of the empirical data for
each of the three lists. This model allocated a separate
asymptote (k) to each serial position, one rate (b) for
serial positions 1 through 5, another rate (b) for serial
position 6 (the most recently studied item), and a common intercept (d) for all the six serial positions for all
lists. This two-rate model increased adjusted-R2 value

I. Oztekin, B. McElree / Journal of Memory and Language 57 (2007) 126-149

from a 6k-1b-1d model from .95 to .98 for List 1, from
.93 to .96 for List 2, and from .95 to .98 for List 3. A
6k-2b-1d model improved the R2 in the all fits of the
individual participants' data for each of the three lists.
The increase in adjusted-R2 value resulted from a faster
rate parameter for the last serial position. The rate in 1/b
ms-units was 115 ms for serial position 6 versus 223 ms
for other serial positions in List 1, 126 versus 254 ms
in List 2, and 126 versus 248 in List 3. The difference
between the two rate parameters was statistically significant in all three lists: t (7) = 4.168, p < .01, for List 1;
t (7) = 5.749, p < .01, for List 2; t (7) = 8.316, p < .01,
for List 3. Fig. 4 shows the SAT functions of the 6 serial
positions for the lists, with smooth curves showing fitted
exponential functions (Fig. A2 shows the corresponding
fits of the proportion correct data).

135

In summary, we replicated previous findings
(McElree, 1996, 1998; McElree & Dosher, 1989) regarding serial position effects on both asymptotic accuracy
and retrieval dynamics within all of the 3 lists. We
now turn to the question of how retrieval dynamics
varied as a function of proactive interference.
General effects of PI on retrieval dynamics
To examine the overall effect of PI across the lists, d 0 s
were computed for each list by averaging over serial
position. We again fit the average and individual participants' retrieval functions with Eq. (1) using a nested
model scheme. Competitive model fits found a 2k-2b1d model to be the best fit to the data. The fit of this
model to the average data is shown in Fig. 5. (Fig. A3
shows the corresponding fits of the proportion correct
data.) This model allocated one asymptote (k) and one
rate (b) to List 1, and another asymptote and rate to
Lists 2 and 3, with all three lists sharing a common intercept (d). The asymptotes for Lists 2 and 3 were significantly lower than the asymptotes for List 1, 2.74
versus 2.60 (respectively) in the average data,
t (7) = 4.72, p < .01. This decline in the asymptotes demonstrated that PI affected the probability of retrieval.
This suggests that PI primarily built up across Lists 1
and 2, but it did not generally decrease performance further. However, 4 participants show some evidence of a
further decline in the asymptote for List 3, which did
engender some measurable differences in asymptotic
performance (see below).
Differences in retrieval speed mirrored the pattern
observed in the asymptotes. These differences were best
captured in rate. The rate (b) declined from List 1 to
Lists 2 and 3, 206 versus 224 ms 1/b units, and this difference in the parameter estimates was significant,
t (7) = 3.04, p < .05. All participants showed a decrease
in both the asymptote and the rate parameters from List

overall the asymptote declined across the lists,
F (2,14) = 4.424, MSe = .383, p < .05. However, the
interaction was also significant, F (10,70) = 2.999,
MSe = .034, p < .05. Interaction contrasts revealed a
significant decline in the asymptote for serial position
1 from List 1 to List 2, F (1,7) = 11.23, MSe = .27,
p < .05, and a marginal decline from List 2 to List 3,
F (1,7) = 11.23, MSe = .19, p = .086. For serial position
2, there was a reliable decline from List 1 to List 2,
F (1,7) = 28.84, MSe = .30, p < .05, and from List 2 to
List 3, F(1,7) = 6.04, MSe = .09, p < .05. For serial position 3, there was a significant decline in the asymptote
from List 1 to List 2, F (1,7) = 6.70, MSe = .07,
p < .05, but not from List 2 to List 3 (p > .1). The comparisons for the more recent serial positions were not
significant. The marginal differences between List 2
and List 3 reflect the fact that PI was essentially asymptotic at List 2 for half the participants.
In terms of retrieval dynamics, there was clear evidence that PI affects the rate of retrieval for serial positions 1-5, but not for serial position 6, the most recently
studied item. In ms (1/b) units, the average rate for serial
positions 1-5 in List 1 was 390 ms, as compared to
426 ms in List 2 and 408 ms in List 3. The b estimates
were reliably faster for List 1 than List 2, t (7) = 2.93,
p < .02, but there were no significant differences between
Lists 2 and 3, t (7) = 0.98, p < .36. Like the general
trend in the asymptotes, PI appeared to build up primarily between Lists 1 and 2, with no further impact in List
3. In contrast, the average rate for serial position 6 in
List 1 was 254 ms, as compared to 258 ms in List 2
and 257 ms in List 3, and there were no significant differences among the b estimates for the lists: t (7) = 0.29,
p < .78, for List 1 versus List 2; t (7) = 0.17, p < .89,
for List 2 versus List 3. Hence, the most recent serial
position appeared to be immune to PI both in terms of
accuracy and retrieval speed.
The absence of an effect of PI on the most recent serial position is consistent with other time-course data
showing that this item remains in focal attention, which
effectively circumvents the need for a retrieval process
(for a review, see McElree, 2006). Collectively, the fits
of the serial position functions provide further evidence

1 to Lists 2 and 3, except one participant who did not
show any asymptotic differences. Table 1 shows the
adjusted-R2 values and estimated parameters of the
2k-2b-1d fit for the average data and all participants.
In summary, the model fits provided clear evidence
that PI lowered the likelihood of retrieving the test
probe from memory. More importantly, they provide
the first reported evidence that PI negatively impacts
on the speed of retrieval.
Effects of PI on serial position
Our analysis of asymptotic patterns indicated that PI
affected the first few items in the list, but not more recent
serial positions. We analyzed the full retrieval functions
to determine whether PI affected retrieval speed in a similar fashion. Consistent with other studies (McElree,
1996, 1998; McElree & Dosher, 1989, 1993; Wickelgren
et al., 1980), adequately modeling the retrieval functions
for the serial positions within each of the individual lists
(see Retrieval dynamics within lists section above)
required allocating separate asymptotic (k) parameters
to each serial position to capture the fact that asymptotic accuracy varied with recency, and a separate rate (b)
parameter to the last serial position to capture the fast
dynamics for the condition that was maintained in focal
attention. To examine how PI affected this pattern
across the lists, we fit an 18k-6b-1d model to 18 functions (6 serial positions within 3 lists) for the average
data and the individual participant's data. For each list,
this model allocated a separate asymptote (k) to each of
the 6 serial positions, and a separate rate (b) parameter
to the last serial position in each list and another rate (b)
parameter to each of the remaining serial positions. All
three lists were fit with a common intercept (d). Table 2
lists the resulting parameter estimates.
With this model, we found clear evidence that PI lowered asymptotic accuracy for serial positions 1-3, but it
did not affect the asymptotes for more recent positions.
A 6 (serial position) * 3 (list) repeated-measures
ANOVA on the asymptotic parameters showed a
main effect of serial position, F (5,35) = 42.778, MSe =
8.476, p < .05, with accuracy increasing in more recent
serial positions, and a main effect of list, indicating that

that PI slowed retrieval speed, even in cases like serial
positions 4 and 5 where its effect on accuracy may be
weak or non-existent.
False alarm analysis
Our results indicate that PI slows retrieval. How does
it do so? To determine whether PI has an across-theboard effect on retrieval speed or whether it selectively
influences either familiarity or the recovery of more specific episodic information, we examined its effect on
recent negatives (RN, a studied item from a previous trial), and distant negatives (DN, at least 168 trials back).
As an RN probe has high familiarity, it should lead to
high FA rates early in retrieval (e.g., McElree, 1998;
McElree et al., 1999; McElree & Dosher, 1989). However, participants should also be better able to recover specific source information for a RN than a DN probe (viz.,
that the RN probe occurred on the previous trials). As
this information accrues later in retrieval, it should serve

to correct or attenuate the FA rates for the RN probe
based on familiarity (e.g., McElree, 1998; McElree
et al., 1999; McElree & Dosher, 1989). Hence, we can
examine the effect of PI on the two forms of information
by comparing changes in the FA functions as PI builds.
To do so, we constructed a d 0 measure, d 0FA , that
scaled the relative degree to which RN trials induced a
higher FA rate than DN trials (e.g., Dosher, McElree,
Hood, & Rosedale, 1989; McElree, 1998, 2001; McElree
et al., 1999; McElree & Dosher, 1989). For both Lists 2
and 3, the z-score of FA rates to RNs were scaled
against z-score of FA to DN, viz., d 0FA 1/4 zFARN 
zFADN , at each of the response lags. This allowed an
unbiased measure of performance by factoring out participants' bias to judge an item as old (e.g., tendency to
respond yes more often than no), and it also factors out
any general tendency to false alarm to a semantically
similar lure, as both DN and RN probes are from the
same semantic category as the study list. Thus, the
resulting score is a pure measure of residual tendency

to false alarm induced by recently studying the RN
probe. Importantly, with this scaling, higher d 0FA values
indicate lower performance due to an increased tendency
to false alarm. Fig. 6 shows the d 0FA for Lists 2 and 3 for
the average data.
Of particular interest was how the d 0FA pattern changed over response lags across the lists. Crucially, the
RNs tested in List 2 were studied in List 1, where PI
was low. In contrast, the RNs tested in List 3 were studied in List 2, where, as the analysis above demonstrates,
PI was operative. Hence, by comparing the respective
FA rates for Lists 2 and 3, we can assess how the build
up of PI affected the ability to reject lures with high
familiarity.
Fig. 6 shows that in List 2, we obtained the general
pattern for RNs that has been reported in previous studies (e.g. McElree, 1998; McElree et al., 1999; McElree &
Dosher, 1989): The d 0FA values increase early in retrieval
and then diminish later in retrieval. This type of nonmonotonic pattern indicates that the information basis
for a judgment shifted across retrieval, and it is what
is predicted from dual-process models of recognition
memory (see McElree et al., 1999). Specifically, a fast
assessment of familiarity is available early in retrieval
and induces a high FA rate for RNs as compared to
DNs. Later in retrieval, this high FA rate diminishes.
The attenuation of the early FA rate reflects the accrual
of new information, presumably recollective source
information (either the source of the lure or that lure
was not in the study list).
Table 3 presents the d 0FA values for the 8 individual
participants, along with the average d 0FA values plotted
in Fig. 6. Six of the eight subjects (S1, S2, S3, S4, S6,
and S7) show a peak FA rate early in retrieval at interruption times between 200 and 500 ms, which is larger
than the FA values at the final three interruption times
ranging from 800 to 3000 ms. The peak value occurs
at 500 ms for all these subjects except S3, who shows

higher values at 200 and 300 ms. Only 2 subjects, S5
and S8, show no clear evidence for a non-monotonic
time-course function.2
Strikingly, Fig. 6 and the corresponding values in
Table 3 show that the non-monotonicity evident in List
2 and in all other investigation of RN manipulations was
absent in List 3, and that List 3 lacked the high FA rate
early in retrieval found in List 2 and other studies. This
suggests that the PI that has built up from Lists 1 to 2
has diminished the familiarity of the RNs. Furthermore;
the d 0FA values for List 3 at the longest lags were indistinguishable from those in List 2. This suggests that PI has
no effect on the retrieval of more specific episodic information, which is assumed to occur later in retrieval.
One way to quantify this pattern and to test these
claims further is to fit the d 0FA values with model that
explicitly assumes that retrieval shifts from one source
of information to another source across retrieval time.
This type of model is formally equivalent to a two-process retrieval model. Ratcliff (1980) proposed one such
two-process SAT model, and McElree and Dosher
(1989; see also Dosher et al., 1989; McElree, 1998,
2001; McElree et al., 1999) adapted this model to the
exponential form:
(
d 0 t 1/4

k1  ebtd ;

for d1 < t < d2

k2  k1  k2 d2  d1 =t  d1   1  ebtd1 ; for t P d2 :

2
Eq. (2) states that during the initial retrieval period
(d1 < t < d2), accuracy depends on accrual of one type
of information, which, in this application, we assume
is familiarity. During this initial period, accuracy is
modeled by the top portion of Eq. (2), a simple exponential approach to an asymptote (k1). At time d2, a second
source of information starts to contribute to the
response. This source of information could arise from
the output from a second process, e.g., a recollective
operation in dual-process models. Alternatively, as
developed more fully in the Discussion section, this
parameter could simply reflect that the retrieval process
is modified over time so that more list-specific source
information begins to be recovered. In either case, the
change in retrieval shifts the asymptote from k1 to k2.
The bottom portion of Eq. (2) states that response accuracy gradually shifts to the new asymptote (k2) starting
at time d2.
In the average d 0FA function, the 5th interruption lag at
800 ms is lower (.411) than both the previous lag (0.6106) and
the two following lags (0.5468 and 0.5128). Although this could
reflect a higher-order non-monotonicity--e.g., a high value at
500 ms that is overcorrected at 800 ms and then upwardly
adjusted again at 1500 and 3000 ms--it is more likely that this
average value simply reflects the contribution of what might be
an unduly low value at lag 800 for S6 (0.3962) and S3
(0.0842) only.

To test whether the effects of PI can be modeled as
a difference in either familiarity, the recovery of more
detailed episodic information, or a combination of the
two operations, we can fit and compare the asymptote
parameters k1 and k2 for Lists 2 and 3. If PI only
impacts on familiarity, we should be able to model
the differences between the d 0FA values for Lists 2
and 3 as a difference in k1 only. Conversely, if PI also
affects the recovery of detailed episodic information,
then the fits will require different k2 parameters for
Lists 2 and 3.
To anchor the fits to the overall time-course patterns, and to thereby insure that the fits of the d 0FA
functions were consistent with the standard d 0 functions, the dual process model was fit to the five functions, viz., the two the d 0FA functions in Fig. 6, and
the three regular d 0 functions for List 1 (scaled against
z(FADN)), List 2 (scaled against z(FARN)), and List 3
(scaled against z(FARN)). In this way, we modeled
the differences in the standard d 0 function in the same

500

800

fashion as the d 0FA functions, either a difference in k1
and k2. We fit both the average and individual participants' data allowing both k1 and k2 to vary across Lists
2 and 3. Table 4 lists the parameter estimates from the
fits of the average and individual participants' data,
and the smooth functions in Fig. 6 show the fits to
the average data points.
For List 2, the average k1, the asymptote reflecting
familiarity, was estimated at 0.697 (in d 0 units),
whereas for k2, the asymptote reflecting the accrual
of specific episodic information, was estimated at
0.494. Six of the eight participants showed this ordering, and the difference in parameters estimates was significant, t (7) = 2.970, p < .05. The higher k1 captures
the non-monotonic nature of the functions, and it suggests an early intrusion of familiarity information that
is corrected later in retrieval. The two intercepts, k1
and k2, indicate that, in the average data, familiarity
began to be operative at 290 ms and the correction
based on more specific episodic information began at

516 ms. Paired-t tests on the two intercepts confirmed
that familiarity was operative earlier in retrieval,
t (7) = 2.359, p < .05.3
In contrast, for List 3, the average k2 was estimated
at 0.499 and k2 was estimated at 0.472, only slightly lower. No consistent differences were seen across participants, and the differences were not significant,
t(7) = 1.560, p > .1. There was no evidence for a
non-monotonic form, and hence no evidence of an early
intrusion of familiarity.
Crucially, a direct comparison of k1 estimates for
Lists 2 and 3 (0.697 versus 0.499 in the average
data) demonstrated that the familiarity estimate was
significantly higher in List 2 than List 3,
t (7) = 2.39, p < .05. However, there was no evidence
that these conditions differed later in retrieval, when
more detailed episodic information, possibly due to a
recollective process, was assumed to be operative.
There was no consistent trend across participants
in the k2 estimates, and a direct comparison of the
estimates (0.494 versus 0.472 in the average data)
was not significant, p > .1. This fit suggests that PI
selectively impacted on fast assessments of familiarity
operative early in retrieval, but there was no evidence to indicate that it affected later retrieval
processes.
A viable method to evaluate the non-monotonicity
of a function is to fit the data with both dual process
and single process models (e.g., Rotello & Heit,
1999). To further demonstrate that a dual process model better explains our data, we fit the average and individual data with a single process model as described in
Eq. (1). Adjusted-R2 comparisons of the single (R2
3
The estimated k1 value for the List 2 data likely underestimates its true value to the degree to which the value at the 4th
point is unduly low (see Footnote 1). This is because fitting
routine essentially splits the differences between 3rd, 4th, and
5th points. If the 4th data point were more in line with the 3rd
and 5th, non-monotonicity would be stronger because the fitted
function would have higher values earlier in retrieval than those
shown in Fig. 6.

ranging from .86 to .92) versus dual process model fits
(R2 ranging from .90 to .98) yielded a higher R2 for the
dual process model fit than the single process model fit,
t (6) = 6.032, p < .01. This was consistent across participants. Thus, a dual process model better accounts for
our data than a single process model. In summary, the
intrusion analysis suggests that PI affects early assessments of familiarity, but it does not impact on the
recovery of detailed episodic information later in
retrieval.

Discussion
Before discussing how PI affected retrieval, we briefly summarize general properties of the observed timecourse functions. Within each list, our findings
replicated previous findings on the effects of serial position on retrieval speed and accuracy (e.g. McElree,
1996, 1998; McElree & Dosher, 1989, 1993; Wickelgren
et al., 1980). Both the analyses of the empirical asymptotic d 0 s and the model fits demonstrated that asymptotic accuracy declined as the positive test item was
drawn from less recent serial positions, except for a
small primacy advantage. This pattern indicates the
likelihood of retrieving memory representations
decreases with intervening study events and possibly
the passage of time. Indeed, McElree and Dosher
(1989) showed that a simple forgetting model--the
acquisition-primacy model of Wickelgren and Norman
(1966)--could fully account for asymptotic profiles of
this form. Consistent with other studies of retrieval
dynamics for items of varying recency, summarized in
McElree (2006), we found that retrieval dynamics show
a sharply dichotomous pattern: Retrieval speed is faster
for the most recently studied item than all other positions, and positions beyond the most recent do not differ in retrieval speed. This pattern suggests that the last
item remained in focal attention at test time, hence
could be rapidly matched to the test probe. All other
items required a slower retrieval process to verify their
list status.

General effects of PI
Analysis of the composite retrieval functions (averaged across serial position) for each of the three lists
indicated that PI decreased the likelihood of retrieving
an item and, crucially, slowed retrieval speed. Model fits
indicated that asymptotic accuracy reliably declined
from List 1 to List 2, as did retrieval speed estimated
by either SAT rate or intercept. In our experimental paradigm, PI built up rapidly between Lists 1 and 2. For
half the participants, the effects of PI were asymptotic
by List 2.
More fine-grained analyses of the individual serial
position functions across the three lists indicated that
the overall decline in asymptotic accuracy was primarily
due to the effects of PI on the first 3 serial positions. No
measurable effects of PI on asymptotic accuracy were
observed for the other, more recent serial positions.
However, PI had a more ubiquitous effect on retrieval
speed, in that it slowed retrieval for all serial positions
except the most recent one.
That PI had no measurable effect on the last serial
position, either in terms of retrieval speed or accuracy,
is consistent with the hypothesis that the most recent
item remains in the current focus of attention when no
activity intervenes between study and test. McElree
(2006) reviewed findings from several experimental paradigms that provide independent support that the last
study event remains in a special state within focal attention, including the finding, replicated here, that the overall retrieval dynamics for this item is markedly faster
than any other serial position. Accordingly, we believe
that the explanation for why PI did not impact on the
final serial position is a simple one: This item is immune
to PI because no retrieval process is needed to execute a
response; rather, participants could simply match the
test probe to the current contents of focal attention.
Immunity to PI
Several researchers have suggested that PI is operative only in long term memory, and that items that are
in working memory are immune to PI induced by
semantic similarity (e.g. Cowan, 2001; Craik & Birtwistle, 1971; Davelaar, Goshen-Gottstein, Ashkenazi,
Haarmann, & Usher, 2005; Tehan & Humphreys,
1995). A common finding is that on an immediate test
(mostly recall tests), the 3-4 most recent items are
immune to PI. We applied an immediate test to systematically investigate and localize PI effects on the recognition of items of varying recency. Analogous to previous
findings, our results show an effect of PI on asymptotic
accuracy for the first 3 items in a 6-item study list.
However, contrary to traditional findings that show
the most recent 3-4 items are immune to PI, our data
show that PI slowed retrieval dynamics for serial

141

positions 4 and 5, which are typically thought to be
maintained in working memory (e.g., Cowan, 2001).
The only item we found to be immune to PI, in terms
of both speed and accuracy, was the last item, a case
where no other material intervened between study and
test. Hence, we believe that immunity from PI results
from information being maintained in the current focus
of attention, not because items are maintained in a
specialized 3-4 item working memory store.
Immunity from PI does not extend to the broader set
of items that many researchers have argued are stored in
working memory because, we believe, these items
require a retrieval process to be restored to active processing. To assert that items in working memory are
immune to PI requires postulating that retrieval from
working memory is qualitatively different than retrieval
from long-term memory. McElree (2006) reviewed the
evidence from several investigations of the dynamics of
memory retrieval from standard working memory paradigms. Although there are solid grounds on which to
draw a distinction between representations in the focus
of attention and those stored in memory, there is no
compelling evidence for either qualitative or quantitative
differences in retrieval for items that are argued to be
within or outside the span of a working memory system.
However, when the possibility of chunking is
acknowledged, we note that there may be less discrepancy between our findings and other studies that have
found immunity for the last 3-4 items. If information
is chunked by some organizing principle, then it is possible that more than one nominal item can remain in
focal attention and thereby be immune to PI. For example, in 9-item lists consisting of 3 instances from 3
semantic categories, McElree (1998) found that the last
three items show the retrieval speed advantage for the
last item on the list observed here and in other studies
(McElree, 1996; McElree & Dosher, 1989, 1993; Wickelgren et al., 1980). McElree (2006) also found that the last
three items from a 6-item list consisting to 3 instances
from 2 semantic categories showed a retrieval advantage. In studies that show no PI effects for the last 3-4
items, it is possible that these items may have been
encoded into a chunk and maintained in focal attention
at test time. In our study, however, the retrieval dynamics advantage was restricted to only the most recent position in all three lists (see Serial position effects section
above), which provides independent evidence that only
the most recent item was maintained in focal attention
at test time.
It may appear odd that our data showed that PI slowed retrieval speed for serial positions such as 4 and 5,
but it did not measurably lower asymptotic accuracy
at these positions. This could simply indicate that SAT
response dynamics provide a more sensitive measure of
PI than asymptotic accuracy. Alternatively, however, if
we are correct in claiming that PI affects global

142

I. Oztekin, B. McElree / Journal of Memory and Language 57 (2007) 126-149

assessments of familiarity and not the recovery of
detailed episodic information (see below), then the
absence of asymptotic effects in these cases might reflect
the fact that the recovery of source information compensated late in retrieval for the early impact of PI on familiarity. In contrast, recovery of detailed episodic
information would be expected to be poorer for less
recent serial positions (e.g., positions 1-3), and therefore
may contribute less to the asymptotes for these items.
Hence, in these cases, the asymptotes might partly reflect
the influences of PI on familiarity.
Localizing the effects of PI
Our analyses of negative trials indicated that recent
negatives (RNs) drawn from List 1, where the effects
of PI are minimal, induced a high rate of false alarms
early in retrieval, relative to the rates observed for distant negatives (DNs). These early false alarm rates are
most readily interpreted as arising from the fact that
RNs have high residual familiarity (strength or related
constructs) as a consequence of recent study. The analysis showed that the false alarm rate diminished later in
retrieval. The late-occurring reduction in the tendency
to false alarm to RNs appears to reflect the recovery
of more list-specific information, either that the test
probe was from an earlier list or that the current study
list did not contain the test probe. This type of pattern
has been found in several studies (e.g., Curran, 2000;
Dosher et al., 1989; Hintzman & Curran, 1994; McElree,
1998; McElree et al., 1999; McElree & Dosher, 1989).
The model fits reported here, as well as in other studies
(e.g., McElree, 1998; McElree et al., 1999; McElree &
Dosher, 1989), demonstrate that these types of nonmonotonic functions can be adequately modeled with
the assumption that a general assessment of familiarity
is available before more list-specific information is
recovered.
Crucially, we found that RNs drawn from List 2 did
not engender non-monotonic functions. This suggests
that PI eliminated the high intrusion rate early in retrieval. Equally importantly, the false alarm rates for RNs in
Lists 2 and 3 were nearly identical at the longest retrieval
time. This suggests that PI simply attenuated familiarity,
and thereby reduced the tendency to false alarm early in
retrieval. There was no evidence in our data to indicate
that PI affected the recovery of detailed episodic information. Had this been the case, participants would have
been less likely to recover the source information necessary to reject a RN as having been in the current study
list. And, as higher d 0FA values reflect a higher tendency
to false alarm, we should have observed functions in
which the d 0FA asymptote for RNs from List 3 were
higher than d 0FA asymptote for RNs from List 2.
We believe that the most consistent interpretation of
the false alarm data is that PI selectively affected a global

assessment of familiarity. Interestingly, if this interpretation of the negative data is correct, it suggests a principled explanation for how PI might slow the retrieval
of a positive test probe (viz., slow the dynamics of the
standard d 0 functions in Figs. 3 and 4). Assuming that
recognition memory performance is typically based on
two types of information--a familiarity assessment,
which is available early in retrieval, and the recovery
of more detailed episodic information, which becomes
available later in retrieval--the slowing of retrieval as
PI builds follows directly from the assumption that PI
eliminates a proportion of the fast assessments of familiarity early in retrieval. Eliminating fast assessments that
would otherwise lead to a correct positive response at
early times will depress the overall rate of rise of the
SAT function relative to conditions like List 1 where
those assessments positively contribute to performance
at early retrieval times.
Other properties of the time-course data are also consistent with this interpretation. Notably, selectively eliminating responses based on familiarity can accommodate
the finding that asymptotic performance was lower in
Lists 2 and 3 than in List 1. A dual-process account
assumes that recognition performance reflects a mixture
of the two types of information, and Eq. (2) explicitly
assumes that familiarity continues to contribute to performance throughout the full time-course of retrieval.4
Hence, if PI decreases familiarity it can be expected to
decrease asymptotic performance, particularly when
participants are less able to recover source information
later in retrieval, as in test probes drawn from less recent
serial positions.
Of course, full acceptance of our interpretation that PI
selectively affects fast assessments of familiarity should be
contingent on further studies employing convergent measures. However, this interpretation is generally consistent
with Crowder's (1976) contention that retrieval discriminability provides the most viable explanation of the detrimental effects of PI on memory. This hypothesis asserts
that PI lowers the probability of retrieval by decreasing
the discriminability of items in memory. In the classical
release-from-PI paradigm (and in our study), this is established by presenting words from the same semantic
category, resulting in the semantic category being an

4

There are two ways in which this is true. First, performance
is a weighted mixture of k1 and k2 after the output from
recollection first becomes available, viz., times after d2, with the
mixture being determined by t. Secondly, d2, the late asymptote,
is not a pure estimate of recollection, but rather it reflects the
contribution of recollection to performance at later phases of
retrieval. No assumptions are made about how the different
types of information combine to form k2. The model is
compatible with the independence assumption made in the
process-dissociation framework, but it is also compatible with
other means of combining information (McElree et al., 1999).

I. Oztekin, B. McElree / Journal of Memory and Language 57 (2007) 126-149

insufficient cue for retrieval. Our claim is that PI reduces
performance by reducing the distinctiveness of items
when the judgment depends primarily on familiarity.
When items from the same category are presented for
three consecutive trials, all items from the category may
have quite similar familiarity values when presented as
recognition probes. This may make it difficult to discriminate studied from unstudied items based on item familiarity alone. Hence, we are in general agreement with
accounts that emphasize the importance of (temporal or
positional) distinctiveness (e.g., Nairne, Neath, Serra, &
Byun, 1997; Neath, 1993; Neath & Knoedler, 1994).
However, our interpretation of the false alarm findings
goes beyond Crowder's original hypothesis in assuming
that the loss of discriminability in recognition is particularly detrimental to general familiarity assessments. The
non-monotonic functions for RNs suggest to us that it is
possible to partially compensate for the loss of discriminability by recovering distinctive information associated
with the test probe if the recollective operations are
engaged by retrieval cues other than the semantic
category.
Finally, although we found no evidence that PI
affects processes that recover detailed episodic information late in retrieval, it is possible that other manipulations or procedures could produce results that indicate
otherwise. This may be the case if the PI manipulation
somehow decreases the discriminability of this type of
information, perhaps, for example, by decreasing the
distinctiveness of source information. As familiarity
and source information are often correlated, this type
of manipulation might engender the same type of
retrieval speed differences observed here, but rather different false alarm functions, ones that show influences of
PI at later retrieval times.
Single- versus dual-process accounts
Do our findings necessitate a dual-process account of
recognition? We have reported two major findings: First,
that PI slows overall retrieval speed, and second that it
appears to lessen the reliance on familiarity information
early in retrieval, which otherwise would engender nonmonotonic false alarm functions for recent negatives. As
noted in the Introduction, single-process accounts might
be able to model the observed slowing of retrieval by
adopting specific assumptions about how PI might
impact on the comparison process. For example, a diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) could explain this pattern by
assuming that PI decreases the variance of the resonance
values. However, it is unclear whether a single process
model can provide a plausible explanation of the nonmonotonic functions in Fig. 6 and in related time-course
studies (e.g., Dosher et al., 1989; Hintzman, Caulton, &
Levitin, 1998; Hintzman & Curran, 1994; McElree &
Dosher, 1993; McElree, 1998; McElree et al., 1999).

143

Single-process models may find it particularly difficult
to accommodate non-monotonic functions that show
crossover relations, where parametric manipulations of
a variable (e.g., repetition in McElree et al., 1999) systematically engender higher false alarm rates early in
retrieval but lower false alarm rates later in retrieval.
These types of non-monotonic functions follow naturally from dual-process models of recognition. Nonetheless, McElree et al. (1999) noted that single-process
models might be able to accommodate these findings
by assuming that a single retrieval process recovers both
familiarity information and more detail episodic (e.g.,
source) information at different phases of retrieval, possibly by using different sets of retrieval cues coupled to
different decision rules. McElree et al. (1999) illustrate
how one might be able to instantiate such an account
in a global memory model such as SAM (Gillund &
Shiffrin, 1984).
Consequently, it remains to be determined whether
single-process accounts can adequately model extant
timecourse patterns or whether these data require a
dual-process account. Importantly, however, our timecourse data suggest that PI may slow retrieval speed
and reduce asymptotic performance by selectively eliminating fast assessments of familiarity whether or not
familiarity information is retrieved with the same
retrieval process as later-accruing source information.
Generality of the results
Our study documents the detrimental effects of PI on
the recognition of items that are temporally extended
over a relatively short-term period. We believe the
results are relevant to any situation in which successful
performance depends upon accessing the products of
recent processing. However, most research on PI has
used recall tasks with delayed tests, and it is not entirely
clear how the effects documented here generalize to these
tasks. The primary difficulty is that recall, which is often
modeled as a series of operations to resample memory,
with cues being dynamically modified by the output of
previous operations, may involve operations quite distinct from recognition (e.g., Murdock, 1982, 1993;
Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981). Hence, it remains to be
determined whether both the findings documented here
will extend to situations where recall is required. Nonetheless, it appears as if both findings bear some similarity to results in recall tasks.
There is evidence that PI slows recall, although it is not
entirely clear how it does so. Wixted and Rohrer (1993)
report that PI slows overall recall latency by increasing
the rightward tail (positive skew) of the latency distributions. They suggest that this might indicate that the
retrieval process used to recover items from the list slows
as PI builds up. This claim is based on the assumption that
the rightward tails of the distributions (specifically, the

144

I. Oztekin, B. McElree / Journal of Memory and Language 57 (2007) 126-149

exponential process in an ex-Gaussian fit of the latency
distributions) reflects changes in retrieval time. To the
degree that this assumption is correct, these recall results
would correspond well to our SAT results. However, that
PI affects the positive skew of a distribution without
inducing concomitant shifts of the leading edge (the mean
and/or variance of the Gaussian in a ex-Gaussian fit),
suggests that PI only impacts on a proportion of trials
but not on the bulk of trials within a condition (Ratcliff
& Murdock, 1976). An alternative account of this
finding is that PI only increases the proportion of
resampling operations in difficult to recall items, rather
than inducing a general slowing of the retrieval for all
items from a list. Our SAT findings are prima facie more
consistent with an across-the-board slowing of retrieval
processes. This stems from the fact that SAT dynamics
differences, either in SAT intercept or rate, tend to be
associated with shifts of the entire response time distribution (e.g., McElree, 1998; McElree & Carrasco, 1999;
McElree & Dosher, 1993). In contrast, manipulations that
induce shifts in the positive skew alone typically engender
differences in SAT asymptotes (e.g., McElree & Dosher,
1989). To the degree that this generalization is correct,
the slowing of responses in the two tasks could reflect
different underlying effects of PI. Clearly, additional
research is needed to determine whether PI has
comparable dynamics effects on both tasks.
Our more tentative claim that PI only affects familiarity assessments also finds support in the recall literature.
As noted, Jacoby et al. (2001) found that process-dissociation estimates indicated that PI did not affect recollection but rather familiarity in a task requiring recall,
albeit cued fragment completion rather than free recall.
Prior learning exerted its influence on recall when participants failed to recover specific episodic information and
incorrectly completed the fragment in a manner consistent with their prior learning. This effect is analogous
to our increased tendency to false alarm to familiar lures
early in retrieval when, presumably, there was not sufficient time for additional list-specific information to
accrue. For recent lures, the build up of PI actually has
an advantageous effect, decreasing this tendency to false
alarm by diminishing overall familiarity. For positive
probes, however, the build up of PI has the detrimental
effect of rendering fast assessments of familiarity as less
distinctive. We have suggested that this may cause the
observed overall slowing of retrieval speed.

Conclusion
Our findings indicate that proactive interference negatively affects recognition performance by slowing retrieval
speed and reducing overall accuracy. The analysis of false
alarms to lures with high familiarity suggested that PI
slows retrieval speed by selectively eliminating familiarity,

leaving the recovery of detailed episodic information
unaffected. The selective affect of PI on familiarity is consistent with Crowder's (1976) retrieval discriminability
account, and it suggests that PI renders familiarity judgments ineffective by reducing the distinctiveness of items
from the same category. Our finding that PI did not
impact on the recovery of source memory is also consistent with this account: If the recovery of source information is driven by retrieval cues other than an item's
semantic category, it may provide distinctive information
with the potential to attenuate the negative impact of PI
on performance. Finally, our analysis of the serial positions functions showed that PI slows retrieval for all serial
positions except the most recent one. In line with previous
research, this finding suggests that the last item on the
study list remains in the current focus of attention. We
suggest that items in focal attention are immune to PI
because they do not need to be retrieved from memory.

Appendix A. Analyses on proportion correct data
This appendix reports analyses on the proportion correct
data corresponding to the analyses presented in the Result section, to address possible concerns about the use of an equal-variance Gaussian d 0 measures. Table A1 presents the average
latency, hit rate, and proportion correct at each interruption
lag for each of the 6 serial positions in each of the 3 lists, as well
as the latency and false alarm data for distant and recent negative lures for each interruption lag.

Asymptotic accuracy
We averaged the proportion correct for the last two interruption lags to obtain an empirical measure of asymptotic recognition accuracy, which is shown in Fig. A1. A 3 (list) by 6
(serial position) repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of list, F (2,14) = 6.405, p < .01, revealing the
overall effect of PI on asymptotic proportion correct across
the lists. Effect of serial position was also significant,
F (5,35) = 21.258, p < .01, indicating that asymptotic accuracy
increased as the test probe was drawn from more recent positions of the memory lists. The interaction of list and serial position was also significant, F (5,35) = 2.244, p < .05. As Fig. A1
illustrates, this interaction resulted from PI's selective impact
on the earlier test probes (probes 1-3) compared to more recent
positions (probes 4-6).

Retrieval dynamics within the three lists
The fitting routine described in Retrieval dynamics within the
lists subsection of the Results section was carried out to investigate dynamics differences on proportion correct data across
serial positions in each of the three lists. Consistent with our
reported results, a 6k-2b-1d model provided the best fit of the
empirical data for each of the three lists. This model allocated
a separate asymptote (k) to each serial position, one rate (b)
for serial positions 1 through 5, another rate (b) for serial position 6 (the most recently studied item), and a common intercept

(d) for all the six serial positions for all lists. Initially, allocating
unique asymptotes to each serial position with a 6k-1b-1d model increased adjusted-R2 value from a 1k-1b-1d model from .76

to .93 for List 1, from .70 to .91 for List 2, and from .67 to .93
for List 3. Furthermore, allocating two rates with a 6k-2b-1d
model increased adjusted-R2 value from a 6k-1b-1d model from
.93 to .97 for List 1, from .91 to .96 for List 2, and from .93 to
.98 for List 3. The fit of the 6k-2b-1d model to the average data
is presented in Fig. A2.

three lists as a function of serial position of the test probe.
(Error bars show the 95% confidence intervals.)

To investigate the overall effects of PI on performance in
each of the 3 lists, proportion correct data for each list was
computed by averaging over serial position. We performed
the same fitting routine outlined in the General effects of PI
on retrieval dynamics subsection of the Results section. We
replicated the findings reported in that section. Competitive
model fits found a 2k-2b-1d model to be the best fit to the data.
This model allocated one asymptote (k) and one rate (b) to List
1, and another asymptote and rate to Lists 2 and 3, with all
three lists sharing a common intercept (d). The asymptotes
for Lists 2 and 3 (0.87 on the average data) were significantly

lower than the asymptotes for List 1 (0.89 on the average data),
t (7) = 3.491, p < .05. The rate decline from List 1 (160 ms on
the average data) to Lists 2 and 3 (173 ms on the average data)
was marginally significant, t (7) = 2.204, p < .063. Fig. A3 presents the proportion correct functions for the 3 lists, with
smooth curves showing fitted exponential functions.

Effects of PI on serial position
To investigate the effects of PI on the different serial positions, we fit an 18k-6b-1d model to 18 functions (6 serial positions within 3 lists) for the average data and the individual
participant's data. For each list, this model allocated a separate
asymptote (k) to each of the 6 serial positions, and a separate
rate (b) parameter to the last serial position in each list and
another rate (b) parameter to each of the remaining serial positions. All three lists were fit with a common intercept (d). The
results of this fit replicated our reported findings on the Effects
of PI on serial position subsection in the Results section. In
terms of asymptotic accuracy, the asymptote parameter showed
a decline across the lists for serial position 1, F (2,14) = 6.813,
p < .01, for serial position 2, F (2,14) = 20.034, p < .01, and
for serial position 3, F (2,14) = 5.925, p < .05. The asymptote
parameters did not show a reliable decline for the more recent
positions, serial positions 4-6, p > .05. Analysis on the rate
parameters indicated that the rate parameter for serial positions
1-5 showed a significant decline from List1 to List2,
t (7) = 2.733, p < .029, but not from Lists 2 to 3, p > .05, consistent with our findings in the Result section indicating that PI's
effects were asymptotic at List 2. The pattern for the rate
parameter of serial position 6, the most recently studied item,
also replicated our reported findings on the d 0 data. The rate
decline for this position was not reliable across Lists 1-2, or
Lists 2-3, p > .05.
