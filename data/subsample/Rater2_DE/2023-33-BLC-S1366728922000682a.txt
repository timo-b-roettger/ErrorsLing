Abstract
A large literature has shown that language context -mixing and switching between languages -
impacts lexical access processes during bilingual speech production. Recent work has suggested
parallel contextual effects of language context on the phonetic realization of speech sounds, consistent with interactions between lexical access and phonetic processes. In this pre-registered
study, we directly examine the link between lexical access and phonetic processes in Spanish-
English bilinguals using picture naming. Using automated acoustic analysis, we simultaneously
gather measures of reaction time (indexing lexical access) and acoustic properties of the initial
consonant and vowel (indexing phonetic processes) for the same speakers on the same trials.
Across measures, we find consistent, robust effects of mixing and language dominance. In
contrast, while switching effects are robust in reaction time measures, they are not detected
in phonetic measures. These inconsistent effects suggest there are constraints on the degree
of interaction between lexical access and phonetic processes.

Introduction
Bilinguals have the amazing ability to flexibly control the language of production. They can
limit speech to one language or mix languages within the same context, all while rarely
producing errors (e.g., Gollan & Goldrick, 2018). However, this flexibility comes at a cost to
processing speed. A large body of experimental work has shown bilinguals are slower to
retrieve words from memory when participants are required to mix languages (e.g., name pictures in multiple languages as opposed to a single language); when mixing, retrieval slows further when switching from one language to another across naming trials (see Kleinman &
Gollan, 2018, for a recent review). Recent studies have provided evidence that the articulation
of speech sounds is also impacted by changing language contexts. Specifically, the phonetic
distinction between similar speech sounds across languages is reduced when mixing multiple
languages (see Amengual, 2021, for a recent review).
For example, voice onset time (VOT), the time between the release of the consonant's
constriction and the onset of periodicity, is a primary cue to the distinction between voiced
and voiceless sounds in both English and Spanish (e.g., "big" versus "pig", "beso" versus
"peso"). In both cases, VOTs are shorter (or more negative) in Spanish than English.
Spanish voiced stops ("beso") are pre-voiced (voicing before the release of the consonant constriction, a negative VOT), while English voiced stops ("big") are produced with a short positive gap between voicing and release of the stop (a small, 0-30ms positive VOT). Spanish
voiceless stops ("peso") are produced with short, positive VOTs (0-30ms) relative to voiceless
English stops ("pig;" 30-90ms; Lisker & Abramson, 1964). As we review in more detail below,
previous studies of cued language switching in picture naming have observed lengthening of
Spanish VOTs and/or shortening English VOTs, such that each sound becomes more like its
counterpart in the other language, reducing the contrast between them (e.g., Goldrick,
Runnqvist, & Costa, 2014; Olson, 2013).
The effect of language context on both reaction times and the phonetic properties of speech
in tasks such as cued picture naming has been interpreted through the lens of theories of
speech production. These theories are integrating the processes of retrieving words from memory with the processes specifying the phonetic detail of words. As discussed in more detail
below, both exemplar (Amengual, 2018) and cascading activation accounts (Goldrick et al.,
2014) allow the processing of these two aspects of speech production to overlap, correctly predicting that both should be sensitive to the same variables.
While such accounts are consistent with existing data, most empirical studies fail to gather
measures of retrieval AND phonetics from the same participants while they are performing the
same task (for exceptions, see Goldrick, Shrem, Kilbourn-Ceron, Baus, & Keshet, 2021;
Gustafson & Goldrick, 2018; Jacobs, Fricke, & Kroll, 2016). To our knowledge, no studies
have examined this issue in the context of language mixing and switching. The current
study aims to address this gap. English-dominant Spanish-English bilinguals performed a
cued-language-switching picture naming task; we gathered reaction times (to examine word

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

retrieval) and phonetic measures of consonants and vowels
(to examine phonetic processing in speech production). All analyses were done within participants. These existing models predict
that we should observe similar effects of mixing and switching in
both reaction times and phonetic measures, and that variation in
reaction times should be related to variation in phonetic
measures.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We begin
by reviewing previous work examining the effect(s) of language
context on bilinguals' lexical access and phonetic processing in
speech production. This motivates the design and methods of
our current study. The results show a mixture of results across lexical access and phonetic processing, presenting a challenge for
existing theories. We conclude by discussing what aspects of
these theories need to be revised and extended to account for
these findings, including areas for future empirical research.
Effects of language context on lexical access and
phonetic processing
Language contexts in speech production
We define a SINGLE LANGUAGE context as an experimental block
where only one of their languages is used (e.g., a Spanish-
English bilingual using exclusively English within a group of
trials). MIXED LANGUAGE context refers to an experimental block
where both languages are used (e.g., a Spanish-English bilingual
using both English and Spanish within a group of trials). Mixed
contexts include STAY (i.e., preceding trial is in same language)
and SWITCH (i.e., preceding trial in different language) contexts
(Gollan & Ferreira, 2009; Meuter & Allport, 1999).
Mechanisms of bilingual speech production
Psycholinguistic theories of speech production typically distinguish several stages of post-semantic processing (e.g., concepts,
lexical items, phonological, and phonetic representations; Levelt,
1989). At each level of processing, there is co-activation of representations (see Melinger, Branigan, & Pickering, 2014, for a
review), both within and across languages (e.g., the concept
DOG activates both the target word <perro> and its translation
equivalent <dog>). In bilinguals, the degree of co-activation varies
across language contexts (e.g., when switching languages, there is
increased co-activation of representations in the target and nontarget language relative to stay trials; Bobb & Wodniecka, 2013).
Within this framework, some proposals incorporate interaction
between these stages of processing (e.g., Goldrick et al., 2014).
Co-activation in lexical access yields co-activation of target and
non-target phonetic properties, producing articulations that
blend properties of both languages - reducing the contrast
between speech sounds across languages (e.g., reducing the difference in length of VOTs for voiceless stops in Spanish versus
English). To the extent that co-activation in retrieval varies as a
function of language context, such an account predicts parallel
effects of context on retrieval and phonetic measures.
Exemplar theories of speech production (e.g., Pierrehumbert,
2002) represent an alternative conceptualization of these processes but make similar predictions. In such accounts, experiences
of speech perception/production (exemplars), encoded at multiple
levels of linguistic structure (lexical, phonological, phonetic,
social, contextual, etc.), are linked together in long-term memory.
Production is guided by co-activated exemplars produced in

505

similar contexts, leading to enhanced activation of cross-language
exemplars in mixing and switching (Amengual, 2018). Similar to
the cascading activation, this predicts reduction of the phonetic
contrast of speech sounds across languages.

Effects of language context on lexical access
Under each of these accounts, lexical access should be easiest in
single language contexts because of lower co-activation of representations across languages. This is consistent with the findings
of studies which found faster reaction times in single language
blocks in comparison to mixed language blocks (e.g., Christoffels,
Firk, & Schiller, 2007; Gollan & Ferreira, 2009; Hernandez &
Kohnert, 1999; Kleinman & Gollan, 2018; Prior & Gollan, 2013;
Weissberger, Wierenga, Bondi, & Gollan, 2012). In mixed language
contexts, bilinguals have been found to retrieve words even slower
in switch contexts when compared to stay contexts; increased competition between the target word and its cross language competitor
causes the target word to be retrieved more slowly (Declerck, 2020;
Meuter & Allport, 1999; for a review, see Bobb & Wodniecka,
2013). Note that different types of control processes can contribute
to variation in retrieval times in mixed language contexts. In other
words, proactive control processes anticipate interference, which
contribute to mixing costs, while reactive control processes engage
at points where the non-target language interferes with word selection (see Declerck, 2020, for discussion). However, the key predictions of this study rely only on differences in the degree of
coactivation and not these control process distinctions. Theories
integrating lexical retrieval and phonetic detail of words predict
that when there are greater differences in coactivation, larger phonetic effects should be observed.
Studies have also found a reversed dominance effect in mixed
contexts. In single language contexts, bilinguals are faster at
retrieving words in their dominant language than in their nondominant language; in mixed contexts, the asymmetry is weakened or reversed (e.g., Branzi, Martin, Abutalebi, & Costa,
2014; Declerck, Kleinman, & Gollan, 2020; Gollan & Ferreira,
2009; Kleinman & Gollan, 2018). This effect has been attributed
to proactive control processes that select representation in the target language by inhibiting representations in the non-target language (Declerck et al., 2020). When bilinguals are using both
their dominant and non-dominant language, they aim to equalize
accessibility of the two languages, leading them to strongly inhibit
the dominant language. Speakers sometimes `overshoot' this equal
accessibility target, applying greater inhibition than strictly
required, yielding a reversal of dominance effects. As theories
integrating lexical retrieval and phonetic detail of words are sensitive to relative levels of activation, they predict that when the
dominant language is inhibited, it should be more susceptible
to phonetic effects.

Effects of language context on phonetic processing
Cascading activation and exemplar accounts predict that variation
in the co-activation of representations across languages should
simultaneously influence reaction times and the phonetic contrasts between languages. Previous work has not directly examined the question. Instead, it has focused on how language
context influences measures of retrieval only (studies reviewed
above) or how context influences phonetic contrasts (studies
reviewed below). We consider three previous studies that are

506

most similar to our work; these serve to illustrate the diversity of
findings that have been reported in the literature.
Goldrick et al. (2014) tested Spanish(L1)-English(L2/3) speakers residing in Barcelona, Spain (all speakers had some knowledge
of Catalan). They used a cued picture naming task in mixed language contexts, contrasting how the phonetic property of VOT
varied across stay and switch trials. As introduced above, VOT
is utilized in contrasting ways across these two languages. For
example, English words beginning with voiceless stops like /p/
("pig") have longer VOTs than Spanish words with initial voiceless stops ("peso"; note Catalan utilizes VOT similar to Spanish).
The contrast between languages for voiceless stops could therefore
be reduced by increasing Spanish VOTs and/or decreasing
English VOTs. Consistent with this, Goldrick et al. found
decreased VOT in English, the non-dominant language, for
switch contexts in comparison with stay contexts. Similar results
were found for voiced stops ("big" versus "beso"). English realizes
voiced stops with short positive VOTs, while Spanish produces
similar sounds with negative VOTs ( prevoicing stops before closure). Goldrick et al. found that speakers reduced the contrast
between Spanish and English voiced stops by altering productions
in the non-dominant language; they were more likely to produce
voiced stops in English words with Spanish-like negative VOTs on
switch versus stay trials.
Olson (2013) tested Spanish(L1)-English(L2) and 10 English
(L1)-Spanish(L2) bilinguals residing in Austin, Texas. He used a
cued picture naming task in English and Spanish monolingual contexts (95% of the block was in one language and 5% was in the other
language) and a bilingual language context (50% of trials were in
English and 50% in Spanish), contrasting stay and switch trials.
The results showed a decrease in sound contrast in switch contexts
in comparison with stay contexts, with the reduction in contrast
driven by the dominant language (English for English-dominant
bilinguals and Spanish for Spanish-dominant bilinguals). This effect
is larger with switch tokens in the monolingual contexts than in the
bilingual context, which may reflect greater inhibition of the nontarget language in the monolingual context.
Tsui, Tong, and Chan (2019) tested Cantonese(L1)-English(L2)
bilinguals (of varying degrees of dominance) residing in Hong Kong
using a cued picture naming task. They contrasted the production of
voiceless stops in stay and switch trials. The results showed a
decrease in sound contrast in switch contexts in comparison with
stay contexts, with the reduction in contrast driven by the dominant
language for unbalanced bilinguals (English for English-dominant
bilinguals and Cantonese for Cantonese-dominant bilinguals).
However, balanced bilinguals showed no variation in sound contrasts in switch contexts when compared to stay contexts.
These studies suggest that language contexts can influence the
realization of phonetic contrasts. In each case, such effects are
limited to one language, although the particular language that is
impacted (dominant vs. non-dominant) varies, and some participants appear to show no effects (balanced bilinguals in Tsui et al.,
2019). These mixed results may stem from several limitations of
this work. These phonetic studies have not distinguished between
single, stay and switch contexts, making it unclear to what extent
they are measuring switching and/or mixing effects. Most critically, previous work has not studied bilingual lexical access and phonetic processing together. Previous phonetic studies have not collected
data on reaction times - making it unclear if the same participants,
tested on these materials, would show effects in retrieval that parallel
what's been shown in phonetic measures. To be clear, this same limitation impacts studies focused on retrieval - none have collected

Maria Fernanda Gavino and Matthew Goldrick

phonetic measurements. It is therefore important for research to
encompass methods used in both lexical access and phonetic processing, allowing us to strongly test theoretical approaches that aim to join
these two domains together.
The current study
Theories integrating retrieval and phonetic processing predict that
increased difficulty in language selection will result in both slower
reaction times and more accented productions - i.e., more
English-like phonetic properties in Spanish targets and/or more
Spanish-like properties in English targets. However, no study
has tested this prediction. We aimed to address this empirical
gap. Spanish-English bilinguals named pictures in a cued
language-switching task, allowing us to examine performance in
single language and mixed contexts, as well as stay vs. switch
trials. For each trial, reaction times (indexing retrieval) and phonetic measures were analyzed. Extending previous studies of cued
language-switching, we analyzed both initial consonant VOT
and properties of the following vowel. This provided a fuller picture of phonetic processing, examining two distinct types of speech
sound properties on two different segments. Importantly, sample
sizes were set by a pre-registered power analysis based on a previous
phonetic study (see "Supplemental Materials" for details). This
required a large sample size; to address this, we utilized automated
methods for analysis of phonetic measures, a key technical advance
over previous work.
Based on the research reviewed above, we expected to observe
slower reaction times in mixed vs. single language blocks (a mixing cost), and a smaller increase in reaction times on switch vs.
stay trials within mixed language blocks (a switch cost).
Reversed dominance effects may be observed, particularly in mixing costs. Theories integrating retrieval and phonetic processing
predict parallel costs in phonetics: a decrease in the contrast
between languages in mixed vs. single language blocks (a phonetic
mixing costs), along with a smaller decrease in the contrast
between languages on switch vs. stay trials (a phonetic switch
cost). If reversed dominance effects are observed in reaction
times, these theories predict stronger phonetic costs for the dominant vs. non-dominant language. Finally, because such theories
claim a common source for effects in retrieval and phonetics,
the theories predict that such relationships will hold at the level
of individual trials; when retrieval is difficult (i.e., trials with
longer RTs), there will be corresponding difficulties in phonetic
processing (i.e., a decreased contrast between languages).
To preview the results, we find parallel as well as divergent
effects across these measures. The mixture of results challenges
theories that assume very strong integration of lexical and phonetic processing, suggesting that these two processes must be separated to some degree.
Methods
This study was pre-registered (Mertzen, Lago, & Vasishth, 2021)
with the Open Science Foundation (https://osf.io/f8gd4). This
means that the sample size and analyses were planned out before
collecting data and uploaded to the OSF website. Note that due to
issues in controlling for frequency and length effects, we deviated
from our pre-registered analysis plan by omitting cognate status
(see below for details). However, results for mixing and switching
costs were qualitatively similar when cognate status was included
in the model. As noted below, we also deviated from the preregistration in the phonetic analysis of vowels.

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

Participants
A Monte Carlo power analysis, based on the results of Goldrick
et al. (2014), suggested that, for 48 target items, 18 participants
were required to reach power exceeding 0.8 (see Supplemental
Materials for details). Nineteen English-dominant Spanish-
English bilinguals from the metro Chicago area participated in
the study for financial compensation. One participant was
excluded from the analysis due to an equipment error. All participants acquired Spanish from birth and learned English in childhood (mean age of onset of learning = 3.2 years old, range 0-9; see
Appendix A for more self-report data on language background).
Participants were informally screened for ability to produce the
distinctions between the English target vowels (/i/ - // and /e/ //; see below) by the experimenter, a native Spanish-English
bilingual. Dominance was measured by language proficiency,
assessed by the Multilingual Naming Test (MINT; Gollan,
Weissberger, Runnqvist, Montoya, & Cera, 2012). Based on the
size of their productive vocabularies, participants were English
dominant1; each participant had a higher MINT score in
English (mean, 64.9, range, 58-68) in comparison to Spanish
(mean, 54.8, range, 41-65). This suggests that, for these participants, representations of English words have greater lexical
robustness (e.g., Costa, Santesteban, & Ivanova, 2006; Schwieter
& Sunderman, 2008) than representations of Spanish words.
Materials
Appendix B provides target item details. Sixteen non-cognate
words in both English and Spanish2 were selected along with
eight cognates, yielding a total of 48 target lexemes. All words
began with /p, b, t/ or /d/, allowing us to examine how VOT
was impacted by language context, and were followed by /i/ or
/e/ in Spanish and /i, , e/ and // in English, allowing us to examine language context impacted vowel contrasts. While English distinguishes lax (/, / as in "bit" and "bet", respectively) from tense
vowels (/i, e/, as in "beet" and "bait"), Spanish only uses tense
vowels (e.g., "piso" "beso"; Bradlow, 1995). Sound combinations
were as equally distributed as possible, although given the constraints on the lexicons of Spanish and English, it was not possible
to have an equal distribution. After controlling for the phonetic
environment of the initial stops and picturability of the items,
we were unable to match cognates and noncognates for frequency
and length (within each language, cognates were more frequent
and longer than noncognates; these differences were not matched
across languages3). Given this lack of control, we omitted this factor from our analyses. Thirty-two filler lexemes were selected,
1
While no participant is dominant in Spanish, a small minority (four participants)
had a 1 point difference between English and Spanish. To verify that this small group
did not bias the results, the voiced stop model was re-run without these 4 participants.
Critically, we observed the same dominance effects, making us confident that the results
reflect English dominance.
2
Two of the Spanish target words (i.e., dije and betun) were specific to Mexican
Spanish. This is because the phonological constraint on the structure of the first syllable
were prioritized and the first author, who chose the stimuli, is a speaker of Mexican
Spanish. With the wide range of varieties of Spanish spoken by the participants, this
could have caused production difficulties. To minimize this issue, speakers were pretrained on the target labels (see Procedure section). In addition, many exploratory analyses were conducted on the errors produced; these failed to show reliable effects of
dialect-specific words and/or dialect of Spanish spoken.
3
English non-cognate targets were an average of four phonemes long and had a frequency of 39; cognate were six phonemes long and had a frequency of 84. Spanish noncognates were an average of six phonemes long and had a frequency of 34; cognate targets
were an average of seven phonemes long and had a frequency of 74.

507

including 8 non-cognates and 4 cognates in each language, as
well as the translation equivalents of the non-cognate targets.
A colored picture that depicts each word was taken from the
Bank of Standardized Stimuli (Brodeur, Guerard, & Bouras,
2014) or Google Images (images.google.com). Target pictures
were normed by Spanish speakers from Mexico and native
English speakers from the U.S. (see Supplemental Materials for
more details).
Procedure
Participants completed a picture naming task. Target labels were
introduced in two familiarization blocks. First, each picture in the
experiment was shown in random order with its English and
Spanish label for four seconds. Over each label there was the
flag that corresponded with the cued language. Following
Kleinman and Gollan (2018), an American flag was used to cue
English, and a Mexican flag was used to cue Spanish. Flags
were used instead of color to minimize the difficulty of learning
the association between cue and language. In the second familiarization block, participants named each picture in both English
and Spanish, and were cued by flags on which language to
name the picture. After naming a picture, participants were
always given orthographic feedback showing the picture's target
label. This was done to help ensure that participants remembered
the target label for each of the pictures.
After the familiarization blocks, participants completed the
three experimental blocks. Participants were asked to name each
picture as quickly as possible while using the labels from the
familiarization task. Each trial consisted of the presentation of a
fixation cross (350ms), a blank screen (150ms), the flag cue by
itself (250ms), the flag cue with the target picture (maximum of
3000ms), and an intertrial blank screen interval (850ms). The picture disappeared and the experiment moved on to the next trial
once a response was detected. The experiment was implemented
in Max/MSP (Cycling'74, 2016), and responses were recorded
using Audacity (Audacity Team, 2018).
Participants completed two single language blocks (one
English only and one Spanish only) and a mixed language
block. The ordering of single language blocks was counterbalanced across participants. The mixed language block was always
the last block participants completed. Breaks were offered between
blocks and during the last and longest block. In single language
blocks, the entire set of pictures was repeated four times. There
were 24 target words (total of 96 critical trials) and 28 filler
words (total of 112 filler trials). In the mixed language block, pictures were named eight times, half in stay and half in switch trials,
distributed throughout the block. There were 48 target words
(total of 384 critical trials) and 56 filler (total of 448 filler trials).
This yielded a total of 576 critical tokens per participant. There
were two fixed lists for all three blocks that were pseudo randomized such that all trial types were evenly distributed throughout
the block. A filler trial always happened before a target trial, and
there were never two target trials in a row. Pictures were not
repeated on adjacent trials.
Phonetic analysis
A machine learning algorithm (Goldrick et al., 2021; Shrem,
Goldrick, & Keshet, 2019) was used to detect the onset and offset
of VOT. Reaction time was set to the difference between picture
onset and the onset of VOT. Vowels were segmented from the

508

speech using the Montreal Forced Aligner (McAuliffe, Socolof,
Mihuc, Wagner, & Sonderegger, 2017). Praat (Boersma &
Weenink, 2018) was used to analyze the phonetic properties that signal acoustic vowel contrasts: the first (F1) and second (F2) vowel
formants (resonant frequencies of the vocal tract; Peterson &
Barney, 1952). Following standard analysis methods (e.g., Mack,
1989), we focus on measurements of formants at vowel midpoint.
(See Supplementary Materials for additional analyses of other phonetic properties of vowels; no interactions with language context were
found in these analyses). F1 is used to distinguish vowel HEIGHT (e.g.,
the contrast between the vowels in beet vs. bat), while F2 is used to
distinguish vowel backness (e.g., beet vs boot; Peterson & Barney,
1952). The contrasts between the target vowels will be explained
in more detail in the "Results" section.
Exclusion criteria
Errors were identified by the experimenter while the study was conducted, and then hand-checked using the recorded speech. A total of
554 production errors were identified (5%, N = 10, 368). All of these
errors were excluded from analyses of RT and acoustic measures.
Trials were excluded if the automatically measured VOT was
likely an error (voiceless targets: VOTs  5 msec or > 120 msec;
8.6%, N = 4,967; voiced targets: VOTs  - 200 msec, > 50 msec,
|VOT| < 5 msec; 9.4%, N = 4,886). For vowels, any tokens for
which either F1 or F2 were 3 standard deviations away from the
participant's mean within each language were excluded (5.1%,
N = 9,843). Finally, for reaction time (RT) analyses trials with
RTs < 250 msec or > 3000 msec were excluded (total RTs
excluded: 10.8%, N = 9,853).

Reaction time (RT)
R (R Core Team, 2013) was used to run a linear mixed-effects
model that examined log-transformed RT depending on
contrast-coded language context (single as -0.5 versus mix trials
(stay, switch) as 0.25 and stay as -0.5 versus switch as 0.5) and
contrast-coded language (English as -0.5 versus Spanish as 0.5)
along with the interaction of these factors. This same fixed effects
structure was used across all analyses reported below.
Log-transformed RT was used because the residuals of the raw
reaction time model were less well approximated by a normal distribution. For this model and every other model reported in the
paper, random effects were fitted using an iterative procedure.
We attempted to fit the maximal random effects structure, eliminating correlations and terms in order of complexity until the
model converged and did not have a singular fit. To guard against
overfitting, this structure was critically examined following the
procedure described by Bates, Kliegl, Vasishth, and Baayen
(2015). For the RT analysis, there were two sets of correlated random effects factors: (1) by participant, with a random intercept
and random slopes for single vs mixed condition; (2) by item,
with a random intercept, and a random slope for condition.
Significance of fixed effects was assessed by Satterthwaite-corrected
t-tests (lmerTest v3.1; Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen, 2017).
As shown in Figure 1, RTs replicated typical results reported in
the literature. Bilinguals showed a mixing cost, with shorter

reaction times in single versus mixed language contexts ( =
0.27, SE  = 0.03, t = 8.67, p < 0.001). While there was no main
effect of language ( = -0.037, SE  = 0.02, t = -1.5, p > 0.05),
the mixing cost was not uniform across target language (significant language by context interaction;  = -0.098, SE  = 0.02, t
= -4.03, p < 0.001). Follow up regressions within each language
showed the mixing cost was larger in English ( = 0.32, SE  =
0.04, t = 9.3, p < 0.001) than Spanish ( = 0.22, SE  = 0.04, t =
6.1, p < 0.001). Another set of follow up regressions within condition indicated that there is non-significant advantage of English
over Spanish in single language contexts ( = 0.01, SE  = 0.03,
t = 0.43, p > 0.05), which shows a trend towards a reversal in
mixed language contexts ( = -0.06, SE  = 0.03, t = -1.97, p > 0.05).
Participants also showed a robust switching cost, producing
words more quickly in stay vs. switch contexts ( = 0.05, SE
 = 0.008, t = 6.47, p < 0.001). There was no significant interaction
of switching and language ( = 0.009, SE  = 0.02, t = 0.59, p > 0.05).
Error rates
In order to confirm that these reaction time effects did not reflect
a speed-accuracy tradeoff, a logistic mixed-effects model was run
to examine the predictability probability that a trial is correct (1)
vs incorrect (0). Our fitting process yielded two sets of correlated
random effects factors: (1) by participants with a random intercept and single versus mix and language as random slopes and
(2) by word with a random intercept and single versus mix as a
random slope. For all subsequent logistic regressions, significance
of fixed effects was assessed by the likelihood ratio test (Barr,
Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013).
Bilinguals showed a mixing cost since they produced more correct productions in single language contexts (mean: 96%) than in
mixed language contexts (mean: 95%;  = -0.87, SE  = 0.37,
2(1) = 4.97, p < 0.05). They also showed a switching cost, with
more correct productions in stay (mean: 95%) vs. switch contexts
(mean: 94%;  = -0.42, SE  = 0.11, 2(1) = 13.68, p < 0.01). These
results show that reaction time effects did not reflect a
speed-accuracy tradeoff. There were no other main effects (2s
(1) < 1.29, ps > 0.05), nor any interactions (2s (1) < 0.54, ps > 0.05).
Voiceless stops
A linear mixed-effects model examined log-transformed voice
onset time (VOT) with the same set of fixed effects predictors
as above (residuals of the raw VOT model were less well approximated by a normal distribution). Our fitting procedure yielded

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

show bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals)

two sets of correlated random effects factors: (1) by participants
with a random intercept and single versus mix and language as
random intercepts and (2) by word with no slopes.
As shown in Figure 2, bilinguals successfully switched between
their two languages when producing voiceless stops, with English
target words produced with longer VOT than Spanish target
words ( = -0.79, SE  = 0.09, t = -8.6, p < 0.001). Although
there was no main effect of single versus mixed language context
( = -0.003, SE  = 0.03, t = -0.11, p > 0.05), there was a significant interaction between single versus mixed language context
and language ( = 0.2178, SE  = 0.03, t = 6.1, p < 0.001), suggesting that there was a mixing cost with regards to the production of
voiceless stops' VOT4. Follow up regressions conducted on
English and Spanish subsets of the data indicated that this interaction reflected the opposing effects of stay versus mixed contexts
in each language, as seen in Figure 2. In English, VOTs shortened
when mixing (i.e., became more Spanish-like;  = -0.009, SE  =
0.03, t = -3.22, p < 0.01). In contrast, Spanish VOTs were lengthened when mixing (i.e., became more English-like;  = 0.09, SE 
= 0.04, t = 2.2 p < 0.01). Note that these mixing costs were symmetric (i.e., there was no significant difference in the mixing effect
across languages), whereas there were larger mixing costs for
English than for Spanish in RT. Another set of follow up regressions conducted on single and mixed language contexts subsets of
the data indicated that while bilinguals successfully switched
between their two languages in both single and mixed contexts,
the contrast between languages was larger in single ( = -0.88,
SE  = 0.09, t = -9.37, p < 0.001) versus mixed language contexts
( = -0.06, SE  = 0.03, t = -1.99, p > 0.05).
While there was a main effect of switch versus stay contexts
( = 0.03, SE  = 0.01, t = -2.21, p < 0.05), there was no significant
switch cost; the interaction between stay versus switch language
contexts and language was not significant ( = -0.048, SE
 = 0.026, t = -1.88, p > 0.05).
Voiced stops
A logistic mixed-effects model examined the odds of producing
pre-voiced VOT. There were two sets of uncorrelated random
4
Casillas (2021) discusses how mixtures of categorically different productions can
yield apparently gradient effects (e.g., the mean of productions from a mixture of two discretely categories, short- vs. long-lag VOT, can yield a value intermediate between the
means of the two categories). Inspection of the distributions of English and Spanish
positive-lag VOTs reveals no evidence of bimodality; there is a graded shift in the center
of the VOT distributions.

effects factors: (1) by participants with a random intercept and single versus mix and language as random slopes and (2) by word
with a random intercept and single versus mix as a random slope.
Similar to voiceless stops, bilinguals successfully switched
between their two languages when producing voiced stops. As
seen in Figure 3, English target words were produced with more
English-appropriate short-lag VOT than Spanish ( = 2.1,
 SE = 0.34, 2 (1) = 25.96, p < 0.001). Although there was no
main effect of single versus mixed language context ( = 0.06,
SE  = 0.18, 2 (1) = 0.12, p > 0.05), there was a significant
interaction between single versus mixed contexts and language
( = -0.83, SE  = 0.27, 2 (1) = 8.29, p < 0.01) suggesting a mixing cost for voiced stops. Follow up regressions conducted on
English and Spanish subsets of the data indicated that bilinguals
were more likely to produce pre-voiced VOT for English target
words in mixed contexts than in single contexts ( = 0.52, SE
 = 0.25, 2 (1) = 3.78, p < 0.05). In contrast, bilinguals showed
no significant difference in pre-voicing for Spanish target words
in single versus mixed contexts ( = -0.36, SE  = 0.27, 2 (1) =
1.67, p > 0.05). Additional regressions conducted on single and
mixed context subsets of the data indicated that bilinguals successfully switched between their two languages in single and mixed contexts, with a larger distinction in single ( = 2.55, SE  = 0.45, 2 (1)
= 25.5, p < 0.001) than in mixed ( = 1.87, SE  = 0.3, 2 (1) = 23.47,
p < 0.001) contexts. Overall, these results suggest a mixing cost for
English but not Spanish productions, parallel to the dominance
reversal found in RT mixing costs.
There was no main effect of switching ( = 0.19, SE  = 0.09,
2 (1) = 3.36, p > 0.05), or a significant interaction between stay
versus switch language contexts and language ( = -0.12, SE
 = 0.19, 2 (1) = 0.38, p > 0.05).
High vowels (/i,/)
Separate linear mixed-effects models were constructed to examine
the F1 and F2 of high vowels at 50 percent vowel duration as
dependent variables5. The fixed effects structure of previous models was extended to include vowel type (English /i/ versus Spanish
/i/ and English // versus Spanish /i/; each factor was treatmentcoded with Spanish /i/ as the reference-level). For the F1 model,

The mid and high vowel analyses differ from the pre-registered analysis, which was
not sufficient for assessing our research questions. Since it did not compare English
and Spanish vowel categories in the same model, it did not provide information about
changes in the contrast between the two languages of bilinguals.

our fitting procedure yielded two random effects: (1) by participants with a random intercept and (2) by word with a random
intercept. For the F2 at 50 percent duration model, there were
two random effects: (1) by participants with a random intercept
and (2) by word with a random intercept.
For ease of discussion, we summarize the two analyses simultaneously, interpreting variation in phonetic properties in terms
of position in the traditional vowel space (a graphical visualization
of vowel contrasts with F1 as the Y axis and F2 as the X axis). We
describe F1 as indicating whether a vowel is "raised" versus "lowered" (i.e., smaller versus larger F1 values) and F2 as indicating a
change in whether the vowel is more "back" versus "front" (i.e.,
smaller versus larger F2 values). As a reminder, in single language

contexts, English /i/ is expected to be slightly higher and fronter
than Spanish /i/, and English // should be lower and slightly
more back than both English /i/ and Spanish /i/.
As seen in Figure 4, in single language blocks, bilinguals produced English /i/ more front ( = 146.98, SE  = 54.41, t = 2.7,
p < 0.05) and higher than Spanish /i/ ( = -28.16, SE  = 12.54,
t= -2.25, p < 0.05). In mixing contexts, there was significant
raising ( = -6.85, SE  = 2.17, t= -3.16, p < 0.01), decreasing
the contrast between Spanish /i/ and English /i/ ( = 7.91, SE
 = 3.98, t = 1.99, p < 0.05). While there was also significant fronting of Spanish /i/ when mixing ( = 22.06, SE  = 7.81, t = 2.83,
p < 0.01), there was no significant change in the contrast with
English /i/ ( = -20.32, SE  = 14.33, t= -1.41, p > 0.05). Switching

t = -6.09, p < 0.001) and lower ( = 47.54, SE  = 2.58, t = 18.4,
p < 0.001) than Spanish /i/. Neither mixing nor switching significantly impacted the height contrast (see Table 1) or induce fronting (see Table 2).
Mid vowels (/e,/)
The analysis of mid vowels followed that of high vowels, contrasting vowel type with Spanish /e/ as the reference level (English /e/
versus Spanish /e/ and English // versus Spanish /e/). For the F1
model, there were two sets of correlated random effects factors:
(1) by participants with a random intercept and single versus
mix as a random slope and (2) by word with a random intercept.
For the F2 model, there were two sets of uncorrelated random
effects factors: (1) by participants with a random intercept and
(2) by word with a random intercept.
As a reminder, in single language contexts, English /e/ is
expected to be higher and slightly fronter than Spanish /e/, and
English // should be lower and slightly more back than both
English /e/ and Spanish /e/.
As seen in Figure 5, in single language blocks, bilinguals made
a significant distinction between Spanish /e/ and English /e/, with
English /e/ produced more raised ( = -79.79, SE  = 16.92,
t = -4.72, p < 0.001) and fronted ( = 435.2, SE  = 43.41,
t = 10.03, p < 0.001). They also distinguished Spanish /e/ and
English //, producing the English vowel lower ( = 150.79, SE
 = 15.12, t = 9.97, p < 0.001) and backer ( = -233.33, SE
 = 38.78, t= -6.02, p < 0.001). There was significant lowering for

Spanish /e/ ( = 9.37, SE  = 4.57, t = 2.05, p < 0.05) and raising
for English // in mixing contexts, reducing the contrast between
the vowels ( = -18.14, SE  = 4.75, t= -3.82, p < 0.001). There was
significant backing of Spanish /e/ when mixing ( = -16.49, SE
 = 7.53, t= -2.19, p < 0.05), significantly decreasing the contrast
between the two vowels on this dimension as well ( = 31.93, SE
 = 13.9, t = 2.58, p < 0.05). However, the reduction of contrast
between Spanish /e/ and English // did not result in a larger contrast between Spanish /e/ and English /e/ in height ( = -7.2, SE
 = 5.33, t= -1.37, p > 0.05) and backness ( = 25.06, SE  = 13.9,
t = 1.8, p > 0.05) in mixing contexts. There were no significant effects
of switching on raising (see Table 3) or backness (see Table 4).
Relationship between reaction time and phonetic measures
A key advantage of our study, relative to previous work, is that we
can directly assess whether difficulties in retrieval were related to
difficulties in phonetic processing by examining the by-trial relationships between the two measures. We did this via a series of
follow up regression analyses. The final model for each phonetic
measure was extended by including RT (centered) and its interactions with other predictors. Model tables are included in
Supplementary Materials.
Across the majority of measures, the results showed that the
phonetic contrast between English and Spanish was reduced on
trials with longer RTs (i.e., significant interactions of RT and language; ts > -8.09, 2 (1) > 4.38, ps < .05). This suggests that, controlling for the effect of context, difficulty in retrieval disrupts
phonetic processing.
RT modulated a mixing effect for height (i.e., F1) in mid
vowels and a switching effect for voiced stops. For mid vowel

height, there were two 3-way interactions: one of RT, single vs.
mix, and Spanish /e/ and English /e/ ( = -35.33, SE  = 18,
t = -1.96, p < 0.05) and another of RT, single vs. mix, and
Spanish /e/ and English // ( = -65.16, SE  = 17.45, t= -3.74,
p < 0.001). These interactions reflect a decrease in contrast
between Spanish /e/ and English // in mixed contexts (single
context mean: 163 hertz; mixed context mean: 141 hertz), with
the effect being magnified in trials where RTs are longer (longer
RT trials single context mean: 171 hertz; longer RT trials mix context mean: 143 hertz; shorter RT trials single context mean: 156
hertz; shorter RT trials mixed context mean: 140 hertz). The lowering of Spanish /e/ impacts the contrast between it and English
/e/, increasing the contrast between Spanish /e/ and English /e/
in mixing contexts (single context mean: -70.9 hertz; mixed context mean: -81.9 hertz), with the effect being magnified in trials
where RTs are longer (longer RT trials single context mean: -60.1
hertz; longer RT trials mix context mean: -77.3 hertz; shorter RT
trials single context mean: -81.8 hertz; shorter RT trials mixed
context mean: -86.6 hertz).
For voiced stops, there was a 3-way interaction of RT, switch vs.
stay, and language ( = 1.44, SE  = 0.56, 2 (1) = 6.52, p < 0.01). This
reflects a floor effect for longer RTs. For trials with quicker-thanaverage RTs, the mean difference between proportion of prevoicing
for Spanish vs. English was larger for stay versus switch trials (33.8%
versus 27.2%), reflecting a switch cost. However, for trials with
slower-than-average RTs, the reduction in the contrast between
languages was already so reduced that switching had no additional effect (stay trial mean: 27.1%; switch mean: 27.7%).
However, across the remaining measures, RT did not significantly
modulate mixing or switching costs (i.e., the RT by context by
language interactions were not significant; ts > -1.65, 2 (1) > 0.61,
ps > .05). This suggests that the mixing effect observed in the analyses in prior sections reflects an independent impact on phonetic
processing, over and above disruptions to lexical processing.

phonetic detail of words. These theories predict that language
context (language mixing and switching) should simultaneously
influence reaction times and the phonetic properties of speech.
However, previous work has not documented these effects simultaneously, within the same participants and trials. To test this
claim, we simultaneously measured, on the same trials, how mixing and switching impacted Spanish-English bilinguals' reaction
times (RTs) as well as phonetic measures of consonants (VOT)
and vowels (F1/F2 at midpoint). Our key findings are summarized
in Table 5. We found robust mixing and switching effects for RTs,
but only found consistent mixing effects on our phonetic variables - a divergence that is not predicted by current accounts.
However, over and above these condition-level effects, analysis
of the trial-by-trial relationship between RT and phonetic measures showed that overall retrieval difficulty leads to a reduction
in the phonetic contrast between languages - consistent with
some degree of integration between lexical retrieval and phonetic
processing. This mixed pattern of results suggests that lexical
retrieval and phonetic processing are neither tightly linked (as
claimed by current proposals) nor completely independent.
Given that we replicated `standard' effects in lexical retrieval,
we are confident that the divergences between RT and phonetic
effects are not due to unusual properties of the stimuli or task.
We found mixing and switching costs (e.g., Gollan & Ferreira,
2009; Hernandez & Kohnert, 1999; Kleinman & Gollan, 2018;
Prior & Gollan, 2013) as well as reversed dominance effects
(e.g., Declerck et al., 2020; Gollan & Ferreira, 2009; Kleinman &
Gollan, 2018). In contrast, the phonetic measures only showed
consistent mixing effects. Furthermore, as summarized in
Table 5, the directionality of the effect varied. The failure to
find significant switching effects in phonetic measures is inconsistent with some previous work using cued switching (e.g.,
Goldrick et al., 2014); however, other studies examining reading
aloud of sentences with code switches have failed to find significant effects (e.g., Grosjean & Miller, 1994; Simakova &
Podlipsky, 2018). As noted in the introduction, the difference
across previous phonetic studies may simply reflect their small
sample size. In contrast, our study is high-powered for a phonetic
study, with the sample size determined by a power analysis based

on previous work showing significant switching effects (Goldrick
et al., 2014).
The divergence of language context effects in lexical retrieval
and phonetic production is not predicted by theories claiming
that processes retrieving words from memory are strongly integrated with processes specifying the phonetic detail of words.
At the same time, the finding that trial-level difficulty modulates
the phonetic contrast between languages suggests that there must
be some degree of integration between these processes. To
account for the full set of data, theories must be revised to
allow for weaker coupling of these two aspects of speech production. In the context of cascading activation theories, one such proposal claims that interactions between lexical access and phonetic
processing continue after the initiation of the response (Fink,
Oppenheim, & Goldrick, 2018; Goldrick, McClain, Cibelli, Adi,
Gustafson, Moers, & Keshet, 2019). According to this account,
participants are able to resolve processing conflicts in lexical
access while phonetic processing is ongoing. Relatively small disruptions to lexical access (e.g., the increased time required for
switch versus stay trials in our experiment) may be fully resolved
before phonetic processing is complete, reducing their impact on
phonetic measures. In contrast, larger disruptions (e.g., the
increased time required for stay versus single trials) will be
more difficult to resolve before articulation begins, yielding interactive effects. Dynamically varying interaction may also be a
promising area of development for exemplar models (e.g.,
Clopper & Pierrehumbert, 2008; see Fink & Goldrick, 2015, for
review and discussion). Longer delays in word retrieval (e.g., mixing effects) might allow a greater number of exemplars from the
non-target language to become activated, further reducing the
phonetic contrast between languages (relative to contexts with
less delays, as induced by switching). Accounting for the full pattern of results observed here will require greater elaboration and
specification of these proposals.
A limitation of this work, and previous experimental phonetic
studies, is that most interactions have been examined with a small
number of phonetic parameters. It's possible that intrinsic properties of these phonetic measures could be skewing results. Most
phonetic studies use VOT, specifically focusing on the contrast
between short-lag and long-lag positive VOTs (as in the contrast
between Spanish versus English voiceless stops in the current
study). The greater range of variation in long-lag VOTs
(Kessinger & Blumstein, 1997) may provide greater power for
observing effects. This confound between language and phonetic
properties complicates the interpretation of results. For example,
effects may have been observed for English stops not because
English was the dominant language, but because English stops
have longer VOTs than Spanish stops. To address this confound,
future work should examine other phonetic measures and language pairings that do not include English. Similarly, there is a
possibility that the higher variability in vowel acoustics as compared to VOT is affecting our ability to measure the effects for
vowels. Investigating a greater range of speech sounds within
and across languages will help clarify whether there are systematic
differences in the relationship between phonetic processing and
control mechanisms.
Conclusion
Bilingual lexical access and phonetic processing have typically
been studied separately. As theoretical approaches work to bridge
this divide, it is critical that we extend empirical research to

513

encompass methods used in both domains. Our direct examination of the link between lexical access and phonetic processes
revealed consistent, robust effects of mixing and switching in reaction time, but only consistent mixing effects in phonetic measures. The divergent results suggest there are constraints on the
degree of interaction between lexical access and phonetic processes. These initial efforts show that richer datasets can provide
important constraints on theories of these processes.
