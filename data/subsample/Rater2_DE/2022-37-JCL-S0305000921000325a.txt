Abstract
In error analyses using sentence repetition data, most authors focus on word types of
omissions. The current study considers serial order in omission patterns independent
of functional categories. Data was collected from Russian and German sentence
repetition tasks performed by 53 five-year-old bilingual children. Number and positions
of word omissions were analyzed. Serial order effects were found in both languages:
medial errors made up the largest percentage of errors. Then, the position of omissions
was compared to visuo-verbal n-back working memory and non-verbal visual forward
short-term memory scores using stepwise hierarchical linear regression models, taking
into account demographic variables and receptive language. The interaction differed
between languages: there was a significant negative association between omissions in
the medial position in German and the final position in Russian and the visuo-verbal
n-back memory score. Our study contributes to the understanding of how working
memory and language are intertwined in sentence repetition.

Introduction
In the last five decades, sentence repetition tasks (SRTs) have been used to evaluate
children's language skills (e.g., Devescovi & Caselli, 2007; Klem, Melby-Lervag,
Hagtvet, Halaas Lyster, Gustafsson, & Hulme, 2015; Nag, Snowling & Mirokovi,
2018;). In particular, they have proven reliable in identifying monolingual and
bilingual children at risk for developmental language disorder (DLD; e.g., Abed
Ibrahim & Fekete, 2019; Conti-Ramsden, Botting & Faragher, 2001; Hamann, Chilla,

Hamann, Chilla, Ferre, Morin, Prevost, dos Santos, Abed Ibrahim & Zebib, 2018).
In an SRT, children listen to isolated sentences of differing complexity and are asked
to repeat them individually. To succeed at the task, studies have suggested that the
participant must actively listen and reconstruct the sentence in terms of meaningful
units and morpho-syntactic structures (e.g., Marinis & Armon-Lotem, 2015). Each of
these activities involves numerous cognitive processes, including storing the
phonological form, parsing and storing parts of the sentence, accessing language
knowledge in long-term memory, and encoding grammatical and phonological
structures. Thus, SRTs reflect a complex interrelation between a participant's
knowledge of relevant linguistic structures, comprehension and production
mechanisms, processing strategies and various types of memory (e.g., Nag et al.,
2018; Polienska, Chiat & Roy, 2015; Poll et al., 2013; Riches, 2012).
The relationship of SRTs to linguistic knowledge and memory
SRT performance has been linked to linguistic knowledge and various types of memory.
Klem et al. (2015) argued that their SRT exclusively measures underlying linguistic
competence, yet did not specify the type of underlying linguistic knowledge
evidenced. Abed Ibrahim and Hamann (2017) found that syntactic complexity has a
highly relevant influence on performance in an SRT, and argue that "working
memory deficits alone cannot account for the poor performance of [monolingual
and bilingual children with DLD]" (Abed Ibrahim & Hamann, 2017, p. 14).
Most researchers agree that some separate (verbal) memory components are linked
to linguistic knowledge. Among them are Riches (2012) and Polienska, Chiat and Roy
(2015), who provided convincing arguments for the role of long-term memory. Many
studies have focused on short-term or working memory, assuming that it has a larger
(e.g., Alloway & Gathercole, 2005; Riches, 2012) or smaller (e.g., Meir et al., 2016)
influence on performance. Conti-Ramsden et al. (2001) found a significant
correlation between a non-word repetition task (NWRT) and an SRT, which the
authors attributed to the role of limited capacity in short-term memory (ibid.,
p. 747). All of these studies focused on a component of verbal memory. However,
some authors have argued that any causal relationship between verbal working
memory and linguistic ability is circular since a test of verbal memory must, to a
certain extent, also measure language (e.g., Mainela-Arnold, Misra, Miller, Poll &
Park, 2012, p. 170). Polienska et al. (2015, p. 116) make a similar argument,
coming to the conclusion that language and memory are intricately intertwined
(cf. e.g., Acheson & MacDonald, 2009).
In this paper, we will differentiate between different types of memory, following
Baddeley's (2012) model. LONG-TERM MEMORY, when it comes to linguistic
knowledge, may be defined as "stored [permanent] language knowledge" (Allen,
Hitch & Baddeley, 2018, p. 2582) with unlimited capacity. SHORT-TERM MEMORY
is defined as "simple temporary storage of information" (Baddeley, 2012, p. 4), and is
often differentiated into visual vs. verbal short-term memory (i.e., "visuo-spatial
sketchpad" vs. "phonological loop"). We will define WORKING MEMORY as
"a combination of storage and manipulation" (ibid, p. 4) in a multi-component
limited capacity system, including short-term memory and interconnected with parts
of long-term memory (ibid., p. 18). This interconnection is enabled through the
episodic buffer, which among other tasks "acts as a buffer store [...] between the

Journal of Child Language

871

components of WM [working memory... and] can hold multidimensional
representations" (ibid., p. 15) as well as through the central executive, a complex
component of working memory responsible for, beyond acting as interface, focusing
attention, dividing attention between modalities and controlling task switching (ibid.,
p. 14).
Unlike the studies presented above, we examine both verbal and non-verbal working
memory. Studies on attention and binding1 in the verbal and visuo-spatial domains of
working memory have shown similar recall mechanisms and analogous limited capacity
systems, sometimes seen as reflecting the role of the central executive (e.g., Hitch, Allen
& Baddeley, 2020). Dual-task paradigms using both types of working memory have
confirmed the interconnectedness of the auditory and visual working memory
systems (e.g., Zokaei, Heider & Husain, 2014). Crucially, serial order effects have
been found consistently both in verbal and visuo-spatial working memory tasks in
adult populations (visual: e.g., Brown, Niven, Logie, Rhodes & Allen, 2017, Hitch
et al., 2020; verbal: e.g., Allen et al., 2018). With regard to sentence recall,
Mainela-Arnold et al. (2012) "underscore[...] the need to study the role of
metacognitive component abilities in completing non-verbal span tasks, as well"
(ibid., p. 174). By comparing verbal and non-verbal memory tasks, we offer a first
investigation into the role of a general memory component in sentence repetition. To
our knowledge, no research to date has directly related non-verbal memory to an
immediate recall SRT.
Analyses of SRTs
Studies that have considered identical repetition data have used immediate recall SRTs
mainly as diagnostic instruments (e.g., Grimm, Aktas & Frevert, 2010; Hamann & Abed
Ibrahim, 2017) or as a measure of language development (e.g., Devescovi & Caselli,
2007). Only a few authors have considered identical repetition in monolingual
typically developing (TD) children. One such example is Polienska et al. (2015),
who considered the identical repetition in an SRT in English and Czech monolingual
populations in a cross-linguistic study, and described "robust results across [the] two
typologically different languages" (Polienska et al., 2015, p. 114). Considering
bilingual populations, Meir et al. (2016) showed that TD Russian-Hebrew bilingual
children performed significantly worse than monolingual Russian-speaking peers in a
Russian SRT. The same TD bilingual children obtained comparable results to
Hebrew-monolinguals in a Hebrew SRT (Meir et al., 2016, p. 16). Hamann and
Abed Ibrahim (2017) showed worse performance by TD bilingual children in a
society-language-German setting in a German SRT than by a monolingual group,
both for identical repetition (discounting only phonological errors) and a "target
structure met"-criterion, allowing for lexical substitutions when syntactic structure
was maintained. Abed Ibrahim and Fekete (2019) found their SRT to be a good
diagnostic tool in bilinguals, though language ability played a large role in the
outcomes (ibid., p. 24). In addition, many prominent results in SRT research
(including claims about the tests' sensitivity and specificity) have been based upon
number of errors or error analysis rather than identical repetition (e.g.,
Conti-Ramsden et al., 2001).

Binding is defined by Hitch et al. (2020, p. 280) as the process "whereby the component features of a
stimulus are conjoined in integrated episodic representations in working memory."

Errors of omission in SRTs and serial recall
Non-identical repetition in SRTs reveals three types of errors. Participants can change
the stimuli through omissions, substitutions or additions, all of which can be
phonological, lexical or morpho-syntactic. Any item may potentially be omitted or
substituted. Actual error manifestations, of course, are somewhat limited by the
schemata and paradigms of the respective language. Past studies have focused on
linguistic categories to analyze error patterns in SRTs. Meir et al. (2016)
considered - besides substitutions - omissions in the forms of 1) "sentence
fragments," 2) "omission of coordinators and subordinators" and 3) "omission of
prepositions" (ibid., p. 442). The authors further analyzed the second and third types
of omission (functional categories). Moll, Hulme, Nag and Snowling (2015) found
that function words were more likely to be omitted than content words and that
these were more likely to be omitted from complex rather than simple sentences.
Neither Meir et al. (2016) nor Moll et al. (2015) considered the position of
omissions within the sentences.
Yet the distribution of positions may well have an influence on the omissions in the
sentences produced by participants. The importance of the position of items in
language acquisition was suggested by Gleitman, Newport and Gleitman (1984).
Their study concluded that auxiliaries in English are learned more easily when they
are in initial and not in second word position. In contrast, Bloom (1990) showed
that in English language development, the three children in his multiple-case study
were more likely to omit the subject than the object: subjects were omitted from
obligatory context in 55% of cases, objects in 9% (ibid., p. 500). The author explains
this as stemming from the subject's placement in the initial position since "the
processing load at every point is proportional to the number of yet-to-be-expanded
nodes that must be kept in working memory" (ibid., p. 501)2. From this we can
extrapolate that the position of items has an effect on how well they can be
remembered and reproduced; certain positions - in Bloom's (1990) paper, the initial
position - are more prone to omissions than others, some are more stable. However,
there is no definitive answer on which position is most at risk of omission, as
different studies - some using tests (Allen et al., 2018; Alloway & Gathercole, 2005),
others using natural data (e.g., Bloom, 1990; Gleitman et al., 1984) - have come to
different conclusions.
In cognitive psychology, serial position effects (a term first coined by Hermann
Ebbinghaus in 1885; cf. Ebbinghaus, 2013) in immediate recall experiments are
well-known. In these experiments the subject hears or reads a list of items and is
then asked to repeat them. Subjects generally recall those items best which were
either mentioned last (RECENCY EFFECT) or very early in the list (PRIMACY
EFFECT), and have the most trouble with items in the middle (e.g., Cowan et al.,
1998; Yoo & Kaushanskaya, 2016). Primacy and recency effects are well-documented
in the realm of visual memory (e.g., Berry, Waterman, Baddeley, Hitch & Allen, 2018
for recency effects in children; Brown et al., 2017 for recency and primacy effects in
older adults). There is a small body of literature describing primacy or recency effects
in data from monolingual children with DLD, who are known for having both
language and memory problems. Gillam, Cowan and Marler (1998) focused on digit

Bloom (1990) was of course working within a very different theoretical framework, which will not be
expounded upon in the current study. Rather we would like to point out that the author also argued on the
basis of position within the sentence to explain why certain items are more susceptible to omission.

recall, and Mainela-Arnold and Evans (2005) considered word recall in a Competing
Language Processing Task (CLPT). While Gillam et al. (1998) found a greater
primacy effect in children with DLD, Mainela-Arnold and Evans (2005) found no
significant primacy effect in either children with DLD or TD. They did, however,
find a significant recency effect in both groups, with a greater effect in the TD group.
It is obvious that there are vital distinctions between CLPTs, word list recall and
SRTs. Chief among them is the component of propositional content, i.e., there is
context for each word within a sentence. Underpinning the difference between word
lists and sentence recall, Allen et al. (2018) compared the recall of word lists and
constrained sentences in young adults. In this context, constrained sentences contain
a limited set of words, but adhere to English grammar, in order to conceptually fall
"between lists and sentences" (ibid., 2018, p. 2572). Both lists and sentences were
matched for number of words and amount of each word type. The authors
considered the serial position of each word within the list or sentence. A clear
sentence effect was found, with more correct responses and fewer errors at every
position. Despite this quantitative difference, the general error curves for lists and
sentences were alike, with the highest proportion of words correct in the first
position, and the lowest number of words correct in the penultimate word position -
in this case, the seventh word. In fact, in the first two positions the authors found a
smaller, albeit still significant, sentence effect than in any other position. We
interpret their findings as evidence of a clear primacy effect. A recency effect seems
marginally present, affecting only the final lexeme in the sentence. It is important
here that - as the authors themselves noted - the "use of constrained sentences
exaggerates the similarities with word lists" (Allen et al., 2018, p. 2581).
To our knowledge, only one previous study has examined serial order effects in an
SRT using "natural" - i.e., non-constrained - sentences. Alloway and Gathercole (2005)
considered serial position effects in an SRT to compare five-year-old monolingual
children with high versus low phonological short-term memory. The 20 target
sentences were taken from previous studies (Potter & Lombardi, 1990 and Bishop,
1982). Each sentence contained a different syntactic structure, and they were
matched for number of words (range six to nine). Alloway and Gathercole (2005)
used two analyses, considering both substitutions and omissions regarding position
within the sentence.
The first analysis used a "strict serial scoring [criterion,] according to which a word
was only scored as correct if it was recalled in its original position within the sentence"
(Alloway & Gathercole, 2005, p. 211). Thus, a single omission led to scoring as incorrect
all positions that followed. This classification was chosen to better differentiate between
groups of participants. As a methodological step, however, it is not consistent with the
traditional concept of serial recall effects. That is to say, if a word is omitted in a middle
position, but the following words are repeated correctly, this - in our view - does not
imply an error in multiple positions. It is unsurprising, therefore, that the authors
described "superior recall at early sentence positions, followed by a reduction in
recall accuracy at middle and later positions" (ibid., p. 214). This finding was heavily
influenced by the authors' method of error classification and counting.
In their second analysis, the authors assigned the error occurrences to three
positions: initial, medial and final position. The initial position consisted of the
subject or the first noun phrase (including a subject relative clause); the final
position was the last noun phrase in the matrix clause (including an object relative
clause), and the medial position was everything in-between. The results of this

874

Elizabeth Stadtmiller et al.

second analysis showed "fewer errors in the initial sentence position compared to the
medial and final position" (ibid., p. 214) as well as a significant difference in the
distribution of position of errors between the high and low phonological short-term
memory groups. In addition, Alloway and Gathercole (2005) found a higher
frequency of errors in the last position than in the middle position. In terms of
primacy and recency, the authors seem to be describing a high primacy effect, and a
complete lack of recency effect.
SRTs and bilingualism
Especially for bilinguals, working memory tests are relevant tools in language
assessment. Since performance in language tests is influenced by extra-linguistic
factors such as age of onset (AoO), length of exposure and quantity and/or quality
of input in both languages, clinical diagnostics cannot be based solely on quantitative
scores in language tests. As such, SRTs have been invaluable tools in the diagnosis of
DLD and its disentanglement from typical bilingual language development (e.g.,
Abed Ibrahim & Fekete, 2019; Armon-Lotem & Meir, 2016; Hamann & Abed
Ibrahim, 2017; Meir, 2018), as well as in the examination of linguistic development
in TD and non-TD populations (e.g., Hamann et al., 2017). Leaving clinical
distinctions aside, then, investigating TD bilingual populations allows us to observe
typical - i.e., unmarked - processing characteristics, such as omission patterns, in two
typologically different languages within the same individuals.
One such language pair is German and Russian, which differ greatly with regards to
morphosyntax, especially word order. Word order in German is stricter than in
Russian, and often regulated by sentence bracketing: for example, the finite auxiliary +
past participle verb phrase is split and forms a bracket with an opening and a closing
element (e.g., (1a)).

`The child (has) called the father.'
Note: Russian makes no distinction with regard to marking definite articles. Thus,
the Russian sentence might in specific contexts also read "A child (has) called a
father." In the further Russian examples this ambiguity has been marked using
brackets.
With sentence bracketing, a German sentence is divided into parts: the first is
delimited on the right side by the finite verb of the matrix clause. The second is
between the opening and closing elements - e.g., (1a). With regard to information
structure in unmarked order, known information (frequently the subject of a given

Journal of Child Language

875

phrase) precedes new information. German also allows for topicalization (of objects or
adverbials), in which the topic is moved left out of the brackets and put in front of the
finite verb (into topic position).
In Russian, word order is more flexible, and governed by information structure: the
unmarked word order Subject-Verb-Object reflects this, with the new information at
the end (e.g., King, 1995; Svedova, 1982). However, these features can be best
observed in texts or conversational data, and cannot be directly considered in
isolated sentences, such as found in an SRT. Comparing the two languages, Russian
has fewer function words3, such as determiners or auxiliary verbs (e.g., (1b)), than
German. This information is provided by inflection, context or word order. Thus,
Russian sentences often contain fewer words than German.
The current study
There is a research gap concerning the relationship of recall of items and their position
within a sentence in both monolingual and bilingual populations. Also, there have been
no studies comparing frequency or position of omissions to memory skills, to our
knowledge. Nor has the distribution of omission errors in children's performance in
SRTs been investigated in detail.
Our study scrutinized the performance of bilingual children in two language-specific
SRTs from typologically different languages, German and Russian. We examined the
relationship of omissions in SRTs with children's receptive language skills and
performance in two memory tests. The study came about within a larger research
project, examining the German and Russian SRT for use in a clinical setting
(Lindner, Held, Lomako & Gagarina, 2014).
As described above, three types of errors may occur in an SRT: omissions,
substitutions and additions. Omissions, in our view, represent a more uniform
cognitive process, "leaving out A," while the process underlying substitutions is
"replacing A with B," where B is highly variable and susceptible to many different
influencing factors (cf. Meringer & Mayer, 1895 on slips of the tongue; Nag et al.,
2018). Thus, the cognitive process of omission has one fewer variable to be accounted
for than substitution. It should be noted that this formulation is a simplification, and
that we do not assume that a substitution can be broken down into "omission +
addition." Neither do we believe that the process of omission is a simple one; on the
contrary, errors of omission are highly complex phenomena, which involve, among
others, categorial features and serial order effects. We will concentrate on omissions in
the initial, medial and final position of the sentence, as defined below.
Given the limited processing capacity of working memory, there are many factors
which influence children's processing, including entrenchment, prosodic salience and,
crucially, position within an utterance. What role does serial position - i.e.,
"vulnerable" or "robust" positions within the sentence - play in sentence repetition,
and are there differences between German and Russian? Can a participant's updating
skills, subsumed under visuo-verbal or non-verbal working memory, predict the
likelihood that these "vulnerable" slots will be filled? The specific research questions
are formulated as follows:
3

Though our analysis does not consider functional categories, it is of note that when children omit words
in SRTs, these are most often function words. This is due, among other things, to low saliency of these
mainly unmarked items (e.g., Meir et al., 2016; Moll et al., 2015).

Research questions
1. How many words do children omit in an SRT, and in what positions? Are there
serial position effects, i.e., primacy and recency effects?
a. in the German SRT
b. in the Russian SRT

Based upon the small existing body of literature, we predict (i) robust primacy effects,
with the smallest number of omissions in both languages in the initial position (Alloway
& Gathercole, 2005; Allen et al., 2018; Gillam et al., 1998). This would be strong
evidence for the role of language-independent processing costs.
We also predict (ii) recency effects, i.e., fewer errors will be found in the final
position than in the medial position in both languages given sentence-lengthindependent analysis (e.g., Allen et al., 2018; Mainela-Arnold & Evans, 2005).
2. Is there an association between the position of omissions in the German SRT and
visuo-verbal n-back working memory or visual forward memory, when receptive
language is taken into account?
3. Is there an association between the position of omissions in the Russian SRT and
visuo-verbal n-back working memory or visual forward memory, when receptive
language is taken into account?
Of course, other linguistic components play a role in sentence processing and sentence
repetition. By controlling for receptive language skills, we hope to subdue the influence
of linguistic knowledge to a certain extent, without facing insurmountable floor effects
that might be found in tests of morphosyntax or production in a bilingual population
with diverse AoOs (cf. Abed Ibrahim & Fekete, 2019). We predict (iii) that memory
skills, both visuo-verbal and non-verbal, will be negatively associated with errors in the
medial position, which would strengthen any finding of primacy or recency effects in
both languages (cf., Hitch et al., 2020; Mainela-Arnold & Evans, 2005; Zokaei et al.,
2014). We predict (iv) no significant differences between Russian and German, but
rather predict the role of memory will remain the same across languages, when
linguistic knowledge is taken into account. This would corroborate high involvement of
non-verbal and/or non-linguistic memory skills in sentence repetition. An association
of non-verbal visual memory would provide strong evidence for language-independent
and domain-general processing mechanisms and memory.
Method
Participants
Our study analyzed data from 53 (27 girls, 26 boys) Russian-German TD bilingual
children (Table 1), in their final year of kindergarten, i.e., before they had received
systematic meta-linguistic education. The children were recruited from various
kindergartens in Berlin, Munich and Lower Bavaria. On the basis of a parental
questionnaire (adapted from Gagarina, Klassert & Topaj, 2010) and IQ tests (Roid,
Miller, Pomplun & Koch, 2013), children with deficits in hearing, or with atypical
neurological or cognitive development were excluded. Children whose performance
was lower than one standard deviation (SD) below the average in an NWRT in
either language (Lindner, Held, Lomako & Gagarina, 2014; German version: Wagner,

Held & Lindner, 2013; Russian version: Gagarina & Valentik-Klein, 2013) were also
excluded, since this task is considered reliably differential for DLD (e.g.,
Thordardottir & Brandeker, 2013). The children had at least one Russian-speaking
parent (when only one, always the mother). The children's receptive language skills
were measured in both languages. All children were within one SD from the group
mean in receptive language, another robust exclusion criterion for DLD (cf. e.g.,
Bishop, 2004), in at least one of their languages. Before beginning the study, all
procedures were approved by the German Linguistics Society ethics committee
(Ethikkommission der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Sprachwissenschaft, DGfS). Parents
provided written, informed consent before participation in the study.
A paired-samples two-tailed t-test to compare the receptive language composite
score in German and Russian found a significant difference: t(52)= -5.56, p < .001.
This means that children's Russian receptive language skills are significantly better
than their German receptive language skills. We may presume that, on average,
Russian is the children's dominant language.
Procedure and materials
Each participant was tested individually in a quiet room in their kindergarten. The tests
for this study were embedded in a larger test battery. Each child had two sessions per
language as well as a separate session for IQ and cognitive tests. The test order was
customized individually to maximize motivation, allowing for flexibility if the child
expressed disinterest or preferred a different order. The German SRT was always the
final test of the second and last session, since, in pilot studies, children showed such
high motivation in performing it that it could be used as a reward. The tests for each
language were at least one week apart. Audio was recorded using the Zoom H4next
audio recorder.
German receptive language tests
The children's German receptive language was measured using a composite score of
receptive vocabulary and sentence comprehension raw scores. Since norms exist only
for monolingual German children, these were not considered. Receptive vocabulary

was measured using subtests from the Patholinguistische Diagnostik bei
Sprachentwicklungsstorungen (PDSS; Kauschke & Siegmuller, 2009), in which
children are orally presented 20 verbs and 20 nouns and must point to the correct
image. Each image is presented with a semantically near and a semantically far
distractor. There is no stop rule. Sentence comprehension was measured with
TROG-D: Test zur Uberprufung des Grammatikverstandnisses (Fox, 2011), in which
the child is orally presented 21 blocks of four sentences and must choose the correct
picture out of four possibilities for each sentence. Each item includes three
distractors, either lexical or morpho-syntactic in nature. A block is scored as
incorrect if one or more sentences are identified incorrectly and the test ends if a
child has five consecutive incorrect blocks.
The composite score was the sum of all raw scores, leading to a maximum total score
for German receptive language of 61.
Russian receptive language tests
Russian receptive language was determined using subtests from the Russian Language
Proficiency Tests for Multilingual Children (SRUK, Gagarina et al., 2010; Gagarina,
Klassert & Topaj, 2015), which provides bilingual norms. In order to maintain
comparability with the German scores, however, we used the same system of
composite score of individual raw scores. In the receptive vocabulary subtest, the
children heard ten nouns and ten verbs and pointed to the correct image out of four
(including a phonological, a semantic and an unrelated distractor). The subtest for
sentence comprehension included eleven test sentences, presented orally. Again, the
child chose from four images, with lexical (i.e., substituting subject, object, predicate
or some combination of these) or morpho-syntactic (e.g., changing perfectivity)
distractors. Neither subtest has a stop rule.
The maximum total score for Russian receptive language was 31.
Memory tasks
Children were tested with two memory tasks. The first was the subtest Forward Memory
from the non-verbal IQ test Leiter International Performance Scale (Leiter-3; Roid et al.,
2013). This subtest is a short-term memory task, in which the participant is presented
with visual cues in the form of child-friendly pictures of frequent items. The examiner
points to the pictures in a certain order and the participant must point to the same
items in the same order. For five-year-olds, the task starts with two pictures. The
maximum number of pictures is eight. If a child repeats seven cumulative sequences
incorrectly, the task is stopped. Task and instructions are performed entirely
non-verbally in an attempt to minimize the component of verbal memory. It is likely
that participants use internal verbal rehearsal to memorize the order they must show,
but the extent to which this is the case cannot be measured. This task reflects visual
short-term memory abilities, since the information given must be stored but not
necessarily manipulated.
The second task used was a test for n-back memory, developed within the research
project (Held, Lindner & Gagarina, 2013). The test was performed with verbal
instructions, given in Russian or German depending on a child's language
dominance as determined with linguistic tasks. In the n-back memory task, pictures
are presented to the child in a booklet. Each page contains an animal (dog, cat or
cow) or a toy vehicle (fire truck, ambulance or car). The child first decides upon a
noise for each item (typically moo for cow, brrum for car, etc.) and is asked to

Journal of Child Language

879

produce this noise every time the item appears. Certain pages contain a picture of a
parrot. Whenever the parrot appears, the child must repeat the noise of the last
animal they saw. The distance between test item and parrot is between one and three
distractors (vehicles). Participants practice the representative noises for the animals
and toys and participate in four practice trials with the parrot before the task starts.
The child is presented with two warm-up items; if they master these, the test is
administered. If not, three further examples are presented before the test items are
presented. There are nine test items (i.e., animals). There is no stop rule. Since the
child is presented with visual stimuli, but additionally performs a verbal (but
non-linguistic) task, we regard this test as measuring VISUO-VERBAL working
memory. The working memory component lies in the processing part of the task:
the child must not only memorize, but process the stimulus visually and assign a
verbal sound to each animal or toy at the same time.
Sentence repetition tasks
The children were given two language-specific SRTs, one in German and one in Russian
(Table 2). In both tests, the sentences were recorded by a native speaker and presented
in a PowerPoint presentation featuring a bear going on a treasure hunt (pictures for the
German SRT modified from Marinis, Chiat, Armon-Lotem, Piper & Roy, 2011 with the
authors' permission). Each sentence is presented once, with exceptions made only for
external interruptions. At the end of the test, the bear reaches a treasure chest and
the participant is rewarded with a sticker.
The German SRT (Lindner, Schmitt & Kuhfuss, 2013), was developed within the
research project, with the goal of better determining risk for DLD in a Russian-
German population. Reviewing a number of existing German SRTs, we found them
unsuitable: they examine a smaller set of structures (e.g., Grimm et al., 2010), or
present more sentences, often aimed at older children (e.g., Hamann, 2013). Our
German SRT presents sentences with a complexity suitable to kindergarten children
from four years onwards. The vocabulary and collocations were chosen from typical
kindergarten language use (Augst, 1985), compared with standard vocabulary tests
(Bockmann & Kiese-Himmel, 2012; Grimm & Doil, 2006) and German language
tests for preschool children (Grimm et al., 2010; Wettstein, 1987). It includes
day-to-day activities and semantic fields such as shopping and playing, as well as
categories like familiar (fairytale) figures, animals, toys and vehicles. The most
relevant syntactic structures of German are presented in two to four sentences: for
example, the finite verb in second vs. last position, sentence bracketing, embedded
clauses, negation and wh-questions (see Appendix, Table A1, for full list of German
sentences).
The Russian SRT was based on the long version of Russian LITMUS-SRep (LITMUS
Sentence Repetition Tasks, Marinis & Armon-Lotem, 2015, developed within the COST
Action IS0804, http://www.bi-sli.org/index.htm, cf. Meir, Walters & Armon-Lotem,
2016). The test, originally with 56 sentences, was reduced to 30 and piloted with
monolingual Russian-speaking children. Since this test was intended for younger
children than those in Marinis and Armon-Lotem's (2015) population, simple
sentences and sentences with three words were added. As such, the Russian SRT
tested ten different structures: various word order simple sentences (SVO, SOV,
OVS), sentences with coordination and subordination, negation, subject and object
relative clauses, conditionals and object and oblique questions (see Appendix,
Table A2 for full list of Russian sentences). The Russian SRT contains fewer words

than the German (153 vs. 200 in total), since German uses fewer morphological markings
to express grammatical and information structure and more function words. Russian, on
the other hand, has richer inflectional morphology with fewer function words than
German.

Coding and scoring
Recordings were transcribed orthographically according to German and Russian
spelling, using the program CLAN - Computerized Language Analysis (MacWhinney,
2000). First, the sentences were coded for identical repetition. In our study, this term
is taken literally and means the repetition of the stimulus sentence with zero
deviations. As for position effects, in German, the assignment of the initial, medial
and final positions suggests itself through sentence bracketing. However, using this
German-specific syntactic structure would prohibit direct comparison with Russian,
as Russian sentence structure varies greatly.
Therefore, we applied a stricter, but at the same time very broad, criterion, so that
three positions can exist in each sentence. These positions are defined post-hoc,
using the specific utterances found, i.e., they do not reflect any words or phrases
within each sentence. Rather, they refer to the placement of the omission relative to
words which were repeated. Therefore, each position can be different for each
sentence and each child. The positions themselves are defined as: INITIAL (there are
no items before the deleted item, e.g., (2) for German, (3) for Russian), FINAL
(there are no items after the deleted item, e.g., (4) for German, (5) for Russian) and
MEDIAL (there are items both before and after the deleted item, e.g., (6a) and (6b)
for German, (7) for Russian). Any of these positions can contain one or more words
(e.g., (4) and (6b) for German, (5) for Russian), up to the amount of words in the
sentence minus one for initial and final deletions (there must be at least one word
after or before the omission, respectively) and minus two for medial omissions (there
must be at least one word before and one word after the omission). Defined thus,
the initial position will not be highly affected by sentence length. The final position
will also be relatively independent of length, since it allows for reductions of many
items (e.g., (4), where there are six final omissions). Additionally, this allows for a

Journal of Child Language

881

more, though not totally, word-type independent analysis. Of course, certain word
types are only found in certain sentence slots, when these are defined on a
word-by-word basis. This is due, on one hand, to the test material, which was
limited in the number of sentences presented (thus, e.g., prepositions are never
found as the first word in a sentence). On the other hand, it is simply the nature of
the syntax of the languages in question (e.g., prepositions and determiners are never
the last word in a sentence). By broadening the definition of the three positions
beyond a single word or phrase slot, any word can be scored in any position, if the
surrounding lexemes are also omitted (or not). For example, in (4) the conjunction
wenn `if/when' or in (5), the preposition v `in/near' is counted as an omission in the
final position, because there is no material after it. Thus, since the positions are
determined post-hoc, there are more opportunities to omit a word from any
functional category in any position. We will refer to omissions only of complete
words. Omissions in our sense include, but are not limited to, utterances other
researchers have considered "fragments" (e.g., Meir et al., 2016), as long as each
"fragment" is at least one complete word. Word order errors in which the number
and type of lexemes are unchanged, as well as omissions of phonemes or morphemes
within words were considered morpho-syntactic substitutions, and as such were not
taken into account for this study. Additions of words (e.g., utoki in (7)) were not
further considered for this study, either.

The coding of each sentence (i.e., the number and position of omissions) was
checked by a second researcher, who had been trained on the coding scheme. Three
errors were discovered, which were amended to fit the coding scheme described.
There were no disagreements beyond these errors.
In this paper, we have concentrated solely on the results per child rather than
considering the effects of individual target sentences' morphosyntax or length.

Journal of Child Language

883

Though the coding scheme described above minimizes the effects of length and
complexity, more errors of omission are of course found in longer sentences in both
languages (see Appendix, Tables A3 and A4).
Results
In this study we investigated omissions in a German and a Russian SRT in relation to
memory skills, controlling for linguistic knowledge in the respective language and
demographic variables AoO (for German), age, IQ and sex. AoO and length of
exposure could not be considered in the same model, since they are, of course,
highly correlated. Replacing the former with the latter revealed no difference and is
therefore not reported on. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (2010)
and R environment (R Core Team, 2018). Two scores were missing from the n-back
memory test. These were imputed using predictive mean matching of all tests
(r MICE-package; von Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). Since the overarching
project is a longitudinal study, we were able to compare the imputed data to the
measuring points before (both participants) and after this study (one of the two).
The imputed data was no more than one point different than the score in the earlier
or later measuring point.
Research question 1a
The first research question asked after number and positions of omissions in the
German SRT. The test contained 200 words, so that the sample of n = 53 contained
a total of 10600 tokens to be repeated. Of these, 830 (8%) were omitted. In Figure 1
the range of possibilities between zero and 43 omissions is covered; there are no
clusters. We see three participants with an amount of omissions more than two SDs
above the group average.

In order to verify that omissions are representative of children's skill in the German
SRT, a Pearson correlation was performed. It should be recalled that identical repetition
here is a very strict criterion, allowing for no divergence from the stimulus, and it is
entirely possible for a child to receive an identical repetition score of zero due to
phonological and/or morpho-syntactic substitutions, while making no omissions.
The identical repetition score (M = 10.00, SD = 7.31) and the number of omissions
(M = 15.68, SD = 18.91) were significantly negatively correlated, r(51) = -.72, p < .001.
This was proofed using a hierarchical linear regression model. When demographic
variables, receptive language skills and short-term forward and n-back working
memory were taken into account, a model to predict identical repetition including
number of omissions was more significantly predictive than one without, F = 10.21,
p < .01, R2 = .08. Number of omissions was negatively associated (b = -.16, t(44)
= -3.2, p < .01) with identical repetition, and mitigated the effects of AoO and
German receptive language. Given the classification above, medial deletions are by
far the most common type of omission in the German SRT, followed by initial and
then final omissions (Table 3).
In fact, of the 47 children whose German SRT showed any omissions (Figure 1), only
one had no medial omissions. This participant showed one omission (initial omission
of an article) and had an above average number of identically repeated sentences. 19 of
47 participants had no initial deletions and another 19 of 47 had no final deletions.
Twelve children of these two groups overlap, in that they had neither initial nor final
deletions, leaving 14 children who had either no initial deletions OR no final
deletions. If children omitted items only from the medial position, they tended to
perform better overall than the children who omitted items in the initial or final
positions. When the categorical variable "only medial omissions" was added to the
hierarchical model above, it became significantly better at predicting number of
identically repeated sentences, F = 6.93, p < .01, R2 = .05. The categorical variable
"only medial omissions" was the best individual predictor, b = 4.11, t(43) = 2.63,
p < .05 after German receptive language (b = .28) and age of onset (b = -.12). This is
evidence of both primacy and recency effects in the German SRT, confirming
predictions (i) and (ii) for German.

Research question 1b
Number and positions of omissions in the Russian SRT contrast with the German. The
test contained 153 words, so that the sample using n = 53 contained a total of 8109
tokens to be repeated. Of these, 269 (3%) were omitted. Twenty participants show
zero omissions (compared to seven participants in German; Figure 2). Four children
were more than two SDs above the group mean.
The number of omissions (M = 5.11, SD = 7.58) again showed a significant negative
correlation with the identical repetition score (M = 16.13, SD = 7.49), r(51) = -.77,

Journal of Child Language

885

Figure 2. Omissions per participant in the Russian SRT, raw scores, sorted from least to most (solid line = M,
dotted lines = 1 SD/2 SDs above M )

p < .001. Analogous to the German, this correlation was checked with a hierarchical
linear regression model, taking into account demographic variables, receptive
language skills and short-term and working memory skills. Again, the addition of
number of omissions significantly improved the model, F = 25.16, p < .001, R2
= .20. The number of omissions was a significant individual predictor, outshining all
other predictors, b = -.66, t(43) = -5.02, p < .001. Omissions may thus be considered a
robust indicator of performance in both the German and Russian SRT.
As Figures 1 and 2 show, the children make significantly fewer omissions in the
Russian SRT as compared to the German. This is illustrated more clearly in Figure 3,
and confirmed using a paired two-tailed t-test; t(52) = 3.64, p < .001. As a result,
there are also fewer omissions in each position in Russian than in German. This
effect is negated by the use of percentages (Table 3 & Table 4).

Although medial omissions are, as in the German SRT, the most common, they are
followed by final and then by initial deletions in the Russian SRT (Table 4).
As compared to 47 (out of 53) children in the German SRT who omitted at least one
word, in the Russian SRT 33 children's SRTs contained omissions. Of these 33, four
children showed no medial omissions. This small number reveals a qualitative
divergence. Two of the four match the German finding: they have one or two
omissions in total, in the final position, and an above average performance in
identical repetition. The other two participants with no medial omissions have a
high number of final omissions (5 and 23, M = 3.12, SD = 5.58), and perform below
average on identical repetition (respectively 16 and 5, M = 16.13, SD = 7.49). Similar
to German, 21 of 33 participants with omissions had no initial and another 15 of 33
had no final omissions. Twelve children of these groups overlap. Interestingly, of
these 12 children, only one is also a part of the group of - coincidentally - 12
children with only medial omissions in German described above.
Unlike in German, the categorical variable "only medial omissions" did not improve
the hierarchical model, F = .80, p < .5, R2 = .01. The categorical variable "only medial
omissions" was insignificant as a predictor, b = -1.50, t(44) = -.90, p < .5 and did not
mitigate number of omissions. Rather, number of omissions remained the best (and
only significant) individual predictor (see above).
Unfortunately, this analysis could not be performed using the categorical variable
"only final omissions," as only two participants fall into this category. Both have an
above average number of identical repetitions (18 and 20) and a below average
number of omissions (respectively 2 and 1). These findings indicate a robust primacy
effect, but an insignificant recency effect, confirming prediction (i) for Russian, but
rebuking prediction (ii).

Research question 2
The second research question asked what association exists between memory skills (i.e.,
non-verbal short-term and visuo-verbal working memory) and omissions in each
position. We conducted three stepwise linear hierarchical regressions. Identical
repetition could not be taken into account in the same model as number of initial,
medial or final omissions due to additivity, r(51) > .7. Mahalanobis distance scores,
Cook's distances and leverage cut-offs (for descriptions of these tests cf., Tabachnick &
Fidell, 2007, pp. 62-67) were calculated for each regression. If a child was above the
cut-off in two or more tests, they were considered an outlier and removed from the
model. Linearity, normality, multicollinearity, homogeneity and homoscedasticity were
met for all data sets after removing outliers.
The first model considered number of omissions in the initial position as the
dependent variable and demographic variables (age, AoO, IQ, sex), German receptive

and visual forward memory with number of omissions in the medial position in the German SRT

language skills and the two memory scores as independent variables. Two outliers were
removed (thus, n = 51). Step one included demographic variables. The model was not
significant and explained only a small amount of variance, F(4,46) = 1.91, p < .5, R2
= .14. No individual variable was significantly associated with number of initial
omissions, though AoO came closest, b = .10, p < .1. The next model, which added
German receptive language, was not significantly improved, F(1,45) = 2.06, p < .5,
R2 = .04, but the small effect of AoO disappeared. The third step included
visuo-verbal n-back memory. Once again, the model was insignificant, as was the
change, F(1,44) = 1.19, p < .5, R2 = .02. Finally, visual forward memory was added
to the model, which remained insignificant, F(7,43) = 1.59, p < .5, R2 = .21.
The second set of regressions considered number of omissions in the final position
as the dependent variable. No outliers were found (n = 53). As above, the model
considering only demographic variables was not significant. However, the addition
of German receptive language ameliorated the model significantly, F(1,47) = 10.43,
p < .01, R2 = .17. Children with high German receptive language skills were more
likely to have fewer final omissions, b = -.14, p < .01. Neither the addition of
visuo-verbal n-back nor of visual forward memory significantly improved the model,
though the addition of n-back memory explained a further 4% of variance.
The last stepwise regression of German omissions used omissions in the medial
position as the dependent variable. One outlier was excluded (n = 52). German
receptive language and omissions in the medial position were somewhat correlated,
r(50) = -.64, p < .05, though not enough to risk suppression through additivity. The
first step included only demographic variables, F(4,47) = 3.35, p < .05, R2 = .22. AoO
was a good individual predictor, b = .27, p < .01. The addition of German receptive
language significantly improved the model, F(1,46) = 21.26, p < .001, R2 = .25 and
mitigated the role of AoO. German receptive language itself was significantly
negatively associated with number of medial omissions, b = -.76, p < .001. The third

step introduced the visuo-verbal n-back memory score, which - unlike when
considering initial and final omissions - caused a noticeable improvement of the
model, F(1,45) = 5.32, p < .05, R2 = .05. Though German receptive language
remained a significant individual predictor, b = -.71, p < .001, n-back memory was
also negatively associated with number of medial omissions, b = -1.62, p < .05.
Adding forward memory improved the model very slightly and non-significantly, F
(1,44) = 1.41, p > .5, R2 = .02 (Figure 4).
As predicted, this finding supports primacy and recency effects indirectly. Since
children who perform well in memory tasks - significantly in those with a verbal
component - are less likely to make medial omissions than children whose memory
scores are not as high, we extrapolate that the medial position is most vulnerable to
poor memory abilities.
Research question 3
Research question three inquired into the relationship between positions of omissions
in the Russian SRT to visuo-verbal and non-verbal visual memory, when
demographic variables (age, sex, IQ) and Russian receptive language are taken into
account. The same threefold stepwise regressions were performed as for the German
SRT. Linearity, normality, multicollinearity, homogeneity and homoscedasticity were
met for all data sets after any outliers were removed.
Beginning with errors of omission in the initial position, one outlier was removed,
(n = 52). Unlike for German, the model including only demographic variables was
predictive, F(3,48) = 2.75, p < .05, R2 = .15, with boys more likely to have more
omissions, b = -1.05, p < .05. The addition of Russian receptive language mitigated
the role of sex, but explained only a further 2% of variance and did not create a
significantly better model. Adding n-back and forward memory did not significantly
improve the model either.
The next set of stepwise regressions considered omissions in the final position as the
dependent variable. Four outliers were removed (n = 49). The model using only
demographic variables reached low significance, F(3,45) = 4.67, p > .01, R2 = .24. Boys
were significantly more likely to have a higher number of omissions in the final
position than girls, b = -2.11, p < .01. The addition of Russian receptive language to
the model significantly improved it, F(1,44) = 10.07, p < .01, R2 = .14. Along with
being individually negatively associated with omissions in the final position in its
own right, b = -.24, p < .01, the Russian receptive language score reduced the
importance of sex, b = -1.38, p < .05. In the third step, n-back memory was added.
This further improved the model, F(1,43) = 7.14, p < .05 and explained another 9%
of variance. Russian receptive language remained highly significant, but n-back
memory was also negatively associated, b = -.41, p < .05. Its addition negated the role
of sex. Finally, adding visual forward memory further improved the model
somewhat, though non-significantly, F(1,42) = 3.80, p > .1, R2 = .04 (Figure 5).
Visual memory was non-significantly positively associated with omissions in the final
position, b = .17, p < .1, but its addition strengthened the individual predictive value
of visuo-verbal n-back memory significantly, b = -.43, p < .01.
In the third regression, the dependent variable was "omissions in the medial
position." No outliers were found (n = 53). Analogous to the omissions in the initial
position, the model including demographic variables significantly predicted number
of omissions in the medial position with girls less likely to omit words in this

Figure 5. Scatterplot of regression of sex, IQ, age, Russian receptive language, n-back memory and visual
forward memory with number of omissions in the final position in the Russian SRT

position, b = -2.76, p < .01. Again, this effect was totally mitigated by adding Russian
receptive language, which is significantly associated with number of omissions in the
medial position, b = -.38, p < .001, and improved the model significantly, F(1,48) =
17.63, p < .001, R2 = .22. The addition of memory scores did not improve the
model, and explained no further variance. This finding does not align with
predictions (iii) or (iv) for Russian. In the Russian SRT, the only position vulnerable
to memory deficits is the final position; children with higher skills in visuo-verbal
n-back memory, but with LOWER skills in visual forward memory are less likely to
omit items here. This does not match the results from research question 1b: there
seem to be recency effects in the Russian SRT. However, they are differentiated by
memory rather than linguistic skills. The exact role of short-term and working
memory skills is far less cut and dried than in the German SRT. Thus, prediction
(iv) - that the effect of memory will be highly similar for both SRTs - cannot be
confirmed.

Discussion
The current study assumed that language and memory are closely intertwined. To this
effect, we analyzed the frequency and distribution of omission errors in a German and a
Russian SRT performed by TD bilingual five-year-olds. We then related positions of
omissions to a non-verbal visual short-term and a visuo-verbal n-back working memory
test, while taking into account German and Russian receptive language, respectively.

In this paper we have proposed a novel methodology for SRT analysis, considering
an additional factor for processing costs in SRTs: namely, the position of an item in the
sentence. Our first question was whether omission patterns show serial order effects.
This was examined in two typologically different languages, specifically asking: are
there certain positions in sentences which are especially vulnerable? If so, are they
analogous to primacy and recency effects observed in recall tasks? If these effects
from recall tasks pertain to SRTs, we may assume that there are lower processing
costs involved in the beginning and end of a sentence, and that these positions will
be less vulnerable than items within the sentence.
We found a significant negative correlation between number of omissions and
identical repetition in both SRTs. This might seem trivial at first glance, but
considering the strictness of the identical repetition criterion, it could not be taken
for granted. Additionally, this shows that - though number and position of omissions
are different across the two languages and, inevitably, a small number of children do
have few omissions and a high number of other errors - the number of omissions,
on the whole, is a reliable measure of how well children are able to reproduce a
sentence in German and Russian.
We observed overall serial order effects in the SRTs in German and Russian: in
contrast to Alloway and Gathercole (2005), we found that the medial position was
especially vulnerable to omissions in both languages, showing a higher number than
the final or initial position. This finding confirms a great body of literature from
cognitive psychology on primacy and recency effects in other types of recall tasks
(e.g., Yoo & Kaushanskaya, 2016; Brown et al., 2017; Hitch et al., 2020), as well as
some early studies on typical child language acquisition, such as Gleitman et al.
(1984). Additionally, in German, those children whose identical repetition scores are
better are more likely to maintain the initial and final positions and omit only in the
medial position, while children with low identical repetition scores are more likely to
omit items in all three positions. There was no association between identical
repetition and omissions in specific positions vs. other positions in Russian, though
this finding of non-significance might be due to the far smaller number of omissions
in the Russian SRT. Position within the sentence is obviously an important factor
alongside receptive language, which should be considered when evaluating sentence
repetition.
The second and third research questions concerned the relationship between the
positions of omissions and visual short-term and visuo-verbal working memory skills
in German and Russian respectively. For each language, three stepwise hierarchical
regressions were calculated. These reinforced the importance of serial order effects.
In German and Russian, when demographic variables are controlled for, receptive
language is significantly negatively associated with omissions in the medial and final
positions, with the former being more strongly associated in German. The small
effect of sex on omissions in the Russian SRT is presumably the product of
socio-cultural influences in Russian families, supported by the fact that adding
Russian receptive language eliminated this effect (for more on the relationship
between gender and Russian-German bilingual language acquisition, cf. Gagarina &
Klassert, 2018, pp. 8-10). Omissions in the initial position cannot be predicted by
receptive language skills in either language. This speaks to a relevant memory
component, matching the findings by Allen et al. (2018) of primacy effects in
sentence recall.

The prominence of the final position, however, seems to go against Berry et al.
(2018) who found that various verbal and visuo-spatial working memory measures
predicted visual working memory in the first two of three serial positions, but not
the third and final position. It is of note that adding the visual memory score
strengthened the predictive value of n-back working memory on the final position in
Russian. This implies that the n-back test does tap into both verbal and visual
memory, but seems to show that the visual component is separate and not
interrelated with number of omissions in the final position, in agreement with Berry
et al. (2018). Further studies with larger Russian-speaking populations are necessary
for conclusions on the full nature of this relationship.
The role of n-back working memory supports prediction (iii) on primacy and
recency effects in German only. Visuo-verbal n-back working memory scores cannot
predict the number of omissions in the initial position in either German or Russian.
There is a robust primacy effect across languages, corroborating much of the
literature (e.g., Allen et al., 2018; Alloway & Gathercole, 2005 vs. Mainela-Arnold &
Evans, 2005, and apparently contradicting Bloom, 1990). In German, omissions in
the final position cannot be predicted by memory skills either. This is partly in
accordance with findings by Berry et al. (2018). The authors come to the conclusion
that recency effects in visual working memory are "automatic and do[...] not draw
on executive attention" (ibid., p. 248). Our findings for the German SRT support
this hypothesis for verbal n-back working memory as well. In addition, the lack of
interaction with omissions in the initial position implies that primacy effects in
sentence recall might also be automatic, as defined by Berry et al. (2018).
In the final position in the Russian SRT, though, visuo-verbal n-back working
memory is significantly associated with the number of omissions, and explains 9% of
variance. This implies that the recency effects in the Russian SRT are not automatic,
as argued for German. The final position, rather, is the most related to memory
abilities, replicating Alloway and Gathercole's (2005) findings.
It is of note that there is a difference in which position can be predicted by working
memory scores in each language, going against our basic prediction (iv) that the effects
would be the same. In our study, there is a significant difference in receptive language
scores (see Table 1), and number of omissions in the SRT (Figure 3), with children
performing better in Russian. One possible explanation for the difference, then, is
that children are more proficient in Russian, and thus rely more heavily on
entrenched linguistic skills - activating long-term semantic memory - rather than
non-language-specific working memory (i.e., the type of verbal memory activated in
list recall) in the Russian SRT. This idea is supported by the findings on receptive
language (itself entrenched in long-term memory), which interacts with omissions in
the medial and final positions in both languages, but not with omissions in the
initial position, a prominent position irrespective of language. This interaction
implies complementarity between n-back memory and receptive language skills, with
one compensating for the other if necessary. It is possible that the children are so
successful at retaining the basic meaning of the sentence in Russian (reflected by
relatively high receptive language skills, see Table 1), that the effects of recency and
primacy are mitigated. If a child has then stored the first parts of the sentence, the
highest processing load will be on the final position, which must be related to the
rest of the sentence. This might explain the negative association between n-back
working memory skills and omissions in the final position, i.e., the final position is
most dependent on working memory. In German, the reverse would be true: the

892

participants might be so inept at recalling content (reflected by relatively low receptive
language skills) and rely so heavily on non-language-specific memory of words or
phonological fragments (influenced heavily by the basic concepts of primacy and
recency effects) that only those children with especially high working memory
abilities are able to retain the medial position, while recency effects allow most
children, even those with low working memory abilities, to fill the final slot in the
sentences. This argument would imply that beyond general serial order effects, the
children are using different, language-specific solutions in the two tests.
This interpretation of language-specific solutions to the SRT leads us to a second
explanation for the difference in which position is associated with n-back working
memory: typological variance. The Russian sentences contain fewer words and
especially fewer function words, as matches typical sentence length. This surely
contributes to the lower number of omissions found in the Russian SRT (see
Supplementary Materials online).
Additionally, in German, linguistic knowledge in terms of expectations of
language-specific structures, such as a closing bracket, might come into play. The
German sentence bracket might offer structural linguistic support in recalling the
final position, in our case specifically in the eleven sentences containing a sentence
bracket4. Strengthened through recency effects, this seems to be the most plausible
explanation for the lack of interaction between n-back working memory skills and
omissions in the final position in German. The question of typological differences in
the position of omissions in SRT repetitions can only be briefly speculated upon
here, and must be tackled in future research, ideally using material designed
specifically for this purpose.
The German SRT in this study was designed for better understanding of children's
language skills in an L2, and both SRTs were intended for use in diagnostics of DLD
within a larger test battery. There were no ceiling effects at age five in either test,
though it was used here in a TD population. This may be due to the fact that
bilingual children in the presence of reduced input and variability of acquisition path
and timing show high diversity (cf. Peukert & Gogolin, 2017). These SRT results
clearly differentiate performance in TD bilingual children by including various levels
of complexity in the SRT. However, the difference in complexity poses a challenge
for the examination of positions of errors of omission. For the investigation of the
position of errors alone, the complexity of sentences should be kept constant, while
for a diagnostic tool the complexity of the sentences must increase. Our solution to
this clash of interests was to apply the very broad position criterion described above.
In future studies, other material must be piloted and used for more in-depth
analysis. Additionally, future research should consider this type of analysis in
monolingual children, to more fully understand any differences between monolingual
and bilingual sentence processing and repetition.
Thus, our findings provide a novel perspective on the interpretation of the reasons
for the identical or non-identical repetition of sentences. The finding of primacy and
recency effects in an SRT challenges the interpretation of SRT data, especially
omissions. Our findings indicate a working memory effect: the better a child's
working memory capacity, the fewer omissions they are likely to produce in the

medial position in German and final position in Russian, irrespective of their language
performance. This study provides support that working memory measured with a
visuo-verbal n-back task explains to a certain extent the position of omissions in
sentence repetition in both German and Russian. In an n-back memory task the
subjects must maintain and manipulate information, i.e., they update information
continuously. Updating is also required in the cognitive task of sentence repetition.
Our results indicate that this ability helps maintain the most memory-dependent
positions in each language, medial for German and final for Russian.
To conclude, the study aims to extend the general understanding of the relationship
of SRTs and linguistic knowledge as well as non-verbal short-term and visuo-verbal
working memory. The medial position had the highest percentage of errors in both
languages. Receptive language was significantly associated with the number of errors
in the medial and final positions in both languages, but not the initial position.
In all models, including receptive language mitigated the effects of demographic
variables (e.g., AoO, sex), re-affirming the status of the children as TD. The number
of errors of omission in the medial position in German and final position in Russian
was significantly associated with visuo-verbal n-back working memory. Our findings
provide evidence for a crucial role of working memory interacting with linguistic
skills in sentence repetition in both languages in Russian-German bilingual children.
