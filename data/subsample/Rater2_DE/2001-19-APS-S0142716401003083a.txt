ABSTRACT
A longitudinal study investigated the claim that phonological memory contributes to vocabulary
acquisition in young children. In the first phase, children were given tests of receptive vocabulary,
receptive grammar, nonword repetition, phonological sensitivity (or "awareness"), and performance
IQ. In the second phase, children were given the nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary tests.
In Session 1, both nonword repetition and phonological sensitivity accounted for variation in receptive vocabulary and grammar after performance IQ effects were controlled. When phonological
sensitivity was also controlled, nonword repetition did not account for significant additional variation in receptive vocabulary and grammar. When performance IQ and autoregression effects were
controlled, all Session 1 verbal ability measures predicted Session 2 vocabulary, but only Session 1
vocabulary predicted Session 2 nonword repetition. When phonological sensitivity was also controlled, Session 1 nonword repetition (leniently scored) predicted Session 2 vocabulary. Overall,
these findings show qualified support for the claim that the capacity component of nonword repetition contributes directly to vocabulary in young children. They suggest that the association between
nonword repetition and vocabulary in young children may, to a substantial extent, reflect a latent
phonological processing ability that is also manifest in phonological sensitivity.

The association between nonword repetition and children's receptive vocabulary
is very well documented (see Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, 1998). This
association is consistent with two hypotheses, which may not be mutually exclusive. According to Baddeley et al. (1998, p. 159; see also Gathercole, Frankish,
Pickering, & Peaker, 1999, p. 85), nonword repetition is best construed as a
measure of the capacity of the phonological store;1 this capacity contributes
directly to vocabulary acquisition in children (see also Gathercole, Hitch, Service, & Martin, 1997; Gathercole, Willis, & Baddeley, 1991a, 1991b; Gathercole, Willis, Baddeley, & Emslie, 1994). Others argue that children with larger
vocabularies construct more detailed phonological representations of novel
items in phonological memory and thus perform better on the nonword repetition task (Fowler, 1991; Metsala, 1999; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993).
Of course, it is quite possible that both views are correct (Brown & Hulme,

1996): vocabulary development could provide the stimulus for the development
of more detailed phonological representations, which underlie the efficient encoding of material within the phonological store, thereby enhancing verbal working memory. In turn, the efficient operation of phonological memory may facilitate vocabulary development.
For Baddeley et al. (1998), evidence that phonological memory capacity contributes directly to vocabulary acquisition can be found in a case study of an
Italian left-hemisphere stroke patient, PV, who showed a marked dissociation
between short-term and long-term auditory verbal memory (Basso, Spinnler,
Vallar, & Zanobio, 1982). PV could accurately repeat only monosyllabic and
disyllabic nonwords derived from Italian words. Although PV could repeat 80%
of trisyllabic nonwords, she could not repeat four- and five-syllable nonwords
at all (Baddeley, Papagno, & Vallar, 1988). With auditory presentation, PV was
able to learn meaningful Italian-Italian paired associates as well as the controls
(see also Basso et al., 1982), but not Italian-Russian paired associates, even
when the Russian words were only two syllables long (Baddeley et al., 1988).
The case of PV certainly suggests that deficits in the overall functioning of
the phonological memory system are likely to impair the acquisition of new
vocabulary items. It may also be argued that, in relation to adults with a mature
phonological and linguistic system, nonword repetition represents a relatively
pure measure of phonological storage capacity, although phonological processing plays some role even in adults (e.g., Vitevitch, Luce, Charles-Luce, & Kemmerer, 1997). However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating from the
case of PV to the associations between nonword repetition and vocabulary development in children whose phonological systems and processing skills are
still developing, particularly given the emergence of alternative accounts of the
developmental association between nonword repetition and vocabulary development.
According to the lexical restructuring model (Metsala & Walley, 1998; see
also Fowler, 1991; Walley, 1993), children's vocabularies are not originally
represented as a sequence of individual phonemes but instead may be encoded
and retrieved as a holistic pattern of interacting elements, variously described
as gestures, features, or articulatory routines.2 A fully specified phonemic representation is a much more efficient method of encoding, storing, and retrieving
phonological information (Pisoni & Luce, 1987). The lexical restructuring
model argues that the pressure of the child's rapidly expanding lexicon creates
a need for more economical phonological representations of lexical items, eventually producing segmental or phonemic representations (for a review of this
literature, see Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993). Thus, as children's vocabulary expands, the underlying phonological representational structure is reorganized; the representations of words evolve slowly to segmentally or phonemically based representations, which appear to be superimposed upon earlier
representations (see also Aslin & Smith, 1988; Jusczyk, 1986; Menyuk & Menn,
1979; Metsala, 1999; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Studdert-Kennedy, 1987; Walley, 1993).
In the lexical restructuring account, different items may be differently specified, both within and between children, as a function of the word's familiarity

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3
Bowey: Nonword repetition and vocabulary

443

and the density of its phonological neighborhood (see Metsala, 1997a; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993). Thus, familiar items eventually become
phonemically specified in all children, whereas phonologically complex and relatively unfamiliar words are less likely to be fully specified as soon (Fowler,
1991; Metsala, 1997a; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993). The vocabulary
of 7-year-olds contains a much lower proportion of highly confusable items than
that of adults (Charles-Luce & Luce, 1990). It may be assumed, then, that the
process of lexical reorganization extends over a protracted period.
Performance on any task that relies on the availability of accurate phonological representations (e.g., speech perception, lexical access, rapid articulation,
nonword repetition, phonological sensitivity) would be enhanced "by segmental
analysis and by refined, well-articulated prototypes of those segments to which
the input must be compared. This kind of reconstruction may be required when
the signal is less than optimal" (Fowler, 1991, p. 108). In addition, the quality
of phonemic representation in perception and production may influence the ease
with which awareness of these structures is achieved (Fowler, 1991; Metsala &
Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993); some research has found that drawing children's
attention to both articulation (see Lewkowicz, 1980) and speech perception
(Hurford, 1990) may enhance phonemic awareness. Also consistent with this
hypothesis are the findings that productive phonology is closely tied to the development of phonological sensitivity in children between 3 and 5 years (Webster & Plante, 1995), and that children of this age show superior performance
on phonological sensitivity tasks for items that are among the first to be phonemically represented within children's vocabularies, according to the lexical restructuring hypothesis (Metsala, 1999).
Fowler (1991) argued that phonological representation difficulties would be
more apparent in tasks requiring children to process novel words or nonwords
(see also Jusczyk, 1986). In particular, younger and less linguistically mature
children, whose phonological representations are not yet segmentally organized,
may be less efficient in assigning novel stimuli into recoverable representations
than children who can readily assign a segmental structure. Consistent with
this proposal, Metsala (1999) found that 4- and 5-year-old children performed
phonological sensitivity tasks (onset-time blending and isolating initial phoneme) better for word than nonword stimuli. In addition, it is easier for children
with dyslexia (who are generally regarded as having less efficient phonological
processing abilities; see Brady, 1997; Share, 1995; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987)
to repeat words than nonwords that have been carefully derived from them by
replacing two or more phonemes with phonemes differing only in place or manner of articulation (Snowling, 1981).
In the lexical restructuring account, nonword repetition is not primarily
viewed as a pure measure of phonological memory capacity - especially in children. In fact, the nonword repetition task has been widely interpreted as measuring phonological processing abilities in addition to phonological memory capacity (see Bowey, 1996, 1997; Brady, 1986, 1997; Dollaghan, Biber, & Campbell,
1995; Fowler, 1991; Snowling, 1981; Snowling, Chiat, & Hulme, 1991; Snowling, Goulandris, Bowlby, & Howell, 1986). Thus, any manipulation that increases phonological complexity decreases nonword repetition performance. For

instance, children are less able to repeat correctly nonwords that contain consonant clusters than nonwords that do not (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989, 1990a),
and nonwords with uncommon phoneme sequences are repeated less accurately
than nonwords with more common phoneme sequences (Gathercole et al.,
1999). Nonword repetition is a complex phonological processing task involving
a number of different components, including speech perception (Brady, 1986;
Snowling, 1981; Snowling et al., 1986), construction of a phonological representation (Fowler, 1991; Dollaghan, Biber, & Campbell, 1993; Dollaghan et al.,
1995; Snowling et al., 1991), maintenance and redintegration of the phonological representation within the phonological store (Gathercole et al., 1999), retrieval of the phonological representation from the phonological store (Dollaghan et al., 1995), assembly of articulatory instructions from the phonological
representation (Kamhi, Catts, Mauer, Apel, & Gentry, 1988), and articulation
itself. Difficulties in any one of these components may impair nonword repetition performance.
Processing verbal input, particularly that involving novel items (nonwords),
requires highly efficient speech perception (Fowler, 1991) and is processed by
the language module (Mattingly, 1991). In discussing adult speech perception,
Pisoni and Luce (1987) argued that much of variability at the phonetic level
is inherently rule-governed, so that the process of deriving abstract phonemic
representations from the acoustic-phonetic waveform is simplified through the
use of phonological and morphological knowledge (see also Jusczyk, 1986). In
a mature linguistic system, word recognition becomes a process of generating a
rule-governed phonological representation from the acoustic-phonetic information in the waveforms and matching this pattern to patterns previously stored in
memory (for words) or to patterns generated by rule (for nonwords). The quality
of the output of this module depends on phonological development (Fowler,
1991; Walley, 1993). The output can then be exploited for memory purposes
(Mattingly, 1991).
Children's tacit knowledge of the phonological structure of language (including prosody), derived from their own vocabularies, would assist them in forming
and retaining representations of nonwords containing familiar sublexical or lexical units (Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1991; Snowling et al., 1991;
see also Brown & Hulme, 1995; Dollaghan et al., 1993, 1995). Knowledge
of the phonological structure of language would also assist them in forming,
maintaining, and retrieving representations of nonwords that do not contain familiar sublexical or lexical units (Bowey, 1996; Brown & Hulme, 1996; Fowler,
1991; Metsala, 1999; see also Gathercole et al., 1999).
According to Gathercole and Baddeley (1990b, p. 452), the source of individual variation in nonword repetition that is critical for phonological acquisition
must lie in either the quality of children's phonological encoding or the storage
of the phonological representation (see also Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990a, p.
357). The phonological representation may not be as well specified in the first
instance, or it may be subject to more rapid decay functions. They concluded
that, "as yet, the critical processes mediating variations in phonological processing are unknown" (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990b, p. 452). Their conclusion

445

suggests the need to assess the relative contributions of phonological encoding
(and processing) and phonological storage to the developmental association between nonword repetition and vocabulary.
To date, the evidence examining the association between nonword repetition
and vocabulary in children has been carried out largely by Gathercole and Baddeley and their colleagues, and the primary focus has been on the likely contribution of nonword repetition to subsequent vocabulary acquisition. Because
much of the evidence pertaining to this hypothesis has been reviewed elsewhere
(see Baddeley et al., 1998; Bowey, 1996), the present article will address other
issues. Only the evidence from a few key studies will be briefly revisited.
Because nonword repetition is correlated with vocabulary at Time 1 and because vocabulary at Time 1 predicts vocabulary at Time 2, longitudinal studies
that do not control for the effects of vocabulary at Time 1 may overestimate
the contribution of early nonword repetition to later vocabulary (Gathercole &
Baddeley, 1989; Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1992). The hypothesis
that nonword repetition predicts later vocabulary has been tested in several studies by Gathercole and her colleagues. However, the overall pattern of findings
is unclear when the autoregressive effects of earlier vocabulary are controlled.
In one study, nonword repetition at age 4 predicted receptive vocabulary at
age 5, even when the effects of Raven's Matrices and vocabulary at age 4 were
controlled (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989). However, in two other cross-phase
analyses, nonword repetition did not predict subsequent vocabulary, once Raven's Matrices and autoregression effects were controlled (Gathercole et al.,
1992). Furthermore, when Raven's Matrices and autoregression effects were
controlled, vocabulary at age 4 did not predict nonword repetition at age 5,
although vocabulary did predict subsequent nonword repetition in the two other
cross-phase analyses (Gathercole et al., 1992).
In an independent three-phase longitudinal study of nonword repetition and
vocabulary development in children between 3 and 5 years, no cross-phase predictive correlations were reported (Gathercole & Adams, 1994). In another study
of the same group of children (Gathercole, 1995), the 40 items used in the
nonword repetition test at ages 4 and 5 were divided into two sets differing only
in rated wordlikeness (Gathercole et al., 1991). Reanalysis of these data (from
Table 2, Gathercole, 1995) showed that, when autoregression effects were controlled, repetition of less wordlike nonwords at age 4 failed to predict scores on
a composite vocabulary measure at age 5, r(67) = .08, p < .05. The same was
true of repetition of more wordlike nonwords at age 4, r(67) = .07, p > .05.
Although, when autoregression effects were controlled, vocabulary at age 4 predicted repetition of more wordlike nonwords at age 5, r(67) = .37, p < .05, vocabulary at age 4 did not predict repetition of less wordlike nonwords at age
5, r(67) = .08, p > .05. These results are not completely consistent with either
unidirectional view of the association between nonword repetition and vocabulary development.
Thus, the longitudinal work reported by Gathercole and colleagues does not
uniformly support the view that the phonological capacity component of nonword repetition contributes directly to vocabulary acquisition in children. Rather,

446

the evidence suggests that phonological processing ability contributes strongly
to the association between nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary, an outcome that is consistent with the lexical restructuring hypothesis.
When the effects of age and performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive
Matrices (Raven, 1977) were controlled, Gathercole et al. (1991a) found that
nonword repetition, but not rhyme oddity (see Bryant, MacLean, Bradley, &
Crossland, 1990), accounted for significant additional variation in vocabulary
for both 4- and 5-year-old children (n = 57, n = 51, respectively; see Bowey,
1996, for a discussion of this study). However, using a phonological sensitivity
measure (phoneme identity) that is arguably more appropriate with preschool
children (see Bowey, 1994), Bowey (1996) found that both nonword repetition
and phoneme identity accounted for significant additional variation in concurrent receptive vocabulary in a large group of 5-year-olds (n = 205) after age and
performance IQ effects were controlled. Moreover, when nonword repetition
and digit span were also controlled, phoneme identity still accounted for a small
but significant variation (3%) in vocabulary. However, when phoneme identity
was also controlled, nonword repetition did not account for unique variation in
vocabulary. Consistent with the logic of the Gathercole et al.'s (1991a) study,
these findings were interpreted as suggesting that phonological sensitivity and
nonword repetition were largely redundant in explaining concurrent variation in
receptive vocabulary (Bowey, 1996, p. 68). This conclusion is consistent with
the view that phonological sensitivity and nonword repetition both partly reflect
an underlying phonological processing ability, and that the phonological processing component of nonword repetition contributes strongly to its association
with receptive vocabulary.
Bowey's (1996) findings have been replicated twice. Metsala (1999) found
that a composite measure of phonological sensitivity explained significant variation (22%) in vocabulary in children between 4 and 6 years (n = 61), even when
the effects of age and a composite measure of verbal memory span were controlled. (Similar findings were observed when single measures of phonological
sensitivity and nonword repetition were used.) The composite memory span
measure did not account for significant variation in vocabulary after the effects
of age and a composite phonological sensitivity measure were controlled.
(Again, similar findings were observed when single measures of phonological
sensitivity and nonword repetition were used.) Furthermore, the composite phonological sensitivity measure explained significant variation (7%) in nonword
repetition, even when the effects of age and the composite measure of verbal
memory span were controlled. In a similar study of 3- and 4-year-olds (n = 36),
phonological sensitivity explained significant variation in vocabulary, even
when nonword repetition or digit span effects were controlled (Metsala, 1999).
However, with the composite phonological sensitivity measure partialed out,
nonword repetition was not significantly correlated with vocabulary (recalculated from Metsala, 1999, Table 8).
For Metsala, these findings indicated that vocabulary development stimulates
the development of more economical phonemic representations of the mental
lexicon, which, in turn, enhances the ability to encode and process specified
phonological representations of material held in the phonological store, as re-

vealed by performance on both phonological sensitivity and nonword repetition
tasks. Because it generally failed to control for general phonological processing
skills, much of the predictive work of Gathercole and colleagues can be interpreted within the framework of the lexical restructuring model, although exceptions
may be found. For instance, Gathercole et al. (1997) found that digit span correlated with 5-year-old children's ability to learn new vocabulary items, even after
age, general ability, and either vocabulary or nonword repetition effects were
partialed out. Assuming that nonword repetition incorporates a substantial phonological processing component (see Bowey, 1996; Metsala, 1999), this finding
constitutes the strongest available evidence that the capacity component of phonological memory predicts vocabulary acquisition. There is clearly a need for
work that clarifies whether it is the phonological processing or the phonological
store capacity component of the nonword repetition task that contributes most
strongly to the close association between nonword repetition and vocabulary.
One way of doing so would be to include within longitudinal correlational
studies a measure that reflects, even if indirectly, the quality of phonological
representations within the language module (see Bowey, 1997). Because it could
reflect the degree of phonological restructuring of the lexicon (Fowler, 1991;
Metsala, 1999; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993), phonological sensitivity
may provide an indirect and "delayed" (see Metsala & Walley, 1998, p. 108)
measure of the economy of the phonological representations available in vocabulary and the clarity of the phonological representations of novel items (nonwords) held in phonological memory. Thus, phonological sensitivity measures
could provide a means of determining whether phonological memory capacity
contributes to vocabulary acquisition independently of the phonological processing skills involved in efficiently constructing (and retrieving and articulating)
well-specified representation of an item in the phonological store (see Gathercole et al., 1991a, p. 388).
The present study examined the association between nonword repetition and
subsequent vocabulary in young children, seen in their homes in two sessions.
The children were aged 4;10 at the beginning of the study. In the first session,
children were given tests of performance IQ, nonword repetition, phonological
sensitivity, receptive vocabulary, and receptive grammar. In the second session,
approximately one year later, they were given tests of nonword repetition and
receptive vocabulary.
It is possible that the inconsistencies of past research examining concurrent
and predictive associations between nonword repetition, phonological sensitivity, and receptive vocabulary reflect choices relating to performance measures
and analytic techniques. The present research therefore ensured that the most
age-appropriate measures were used. In addition, examination of cross-phase
predictive correlations controlled autoregression effects as well as those of performance IQ.
Phonological sensitivity was assessed using variants of the sound identity
tasks introduced by Wallach, Wallach, Dozier, and Kaplan (1977; see also Bowey, 1994, 1996). In Wallach et al.'s sound identity task, the child was shown
three pictures. The top picture was labeled for the child (e.g., sun), and the child
was told that sun starts with /s/. Then the child was told the names of two

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3

448

additional pictures (ball, sock) and was asked which of the two starts with /s/.
Relative to most other phonological sensitivity measures, the phonological identity task incorporates a small verbal working memory component (see Bowey,
1994). Its use thus provides a fair specificity check in relation to phonological
sensitivity; findings that phonological sensitivity is as strongly correlated with
vocabulary as is nonword repetition cannot be attributed to a common verbal
working memory component. The present phoneme identity test assessed sensitivity to shared final consonants within rime units.
Claims of specific links between verbal abilities that hold when the effects of
general intelligence are controlled are limited by the validity of the intelligence
measures chosen. Gathercole and her colleagues generally employed intelligence
measures showing inconsistent correlations with other performance measures,
including both nonword repetition and vocabulary (see Bowey, 1996). It was
therefore decided to use the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Preschool
and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R) (Wechsler, 1989) as an
estimate of performance IQ. This subtest provides the best single estimate of
performance IQ in the WPPSI-R battery (Sattler, 1992) and has been independently shown to correlate significantly with a range of verbal abilities, including
nonword repetition, receptive vocabulary, and the Grammatic Understanding
subtest from the Test of Oral Language Development-Primary (TOLD-P)
(Newcomer & Hammill, 1991) in 5-year-olds (Bowey, 1996; see also Gathercole et al., 1997).
If phonemic sensitivity is indeed dependent on the emergence of segmentally
based phonological representations (Fowler, 1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998;
Walley, 1993), then when the phonological memory capacity component of the
phonological sensitivity task is minimized, phonological sensitivity may be
viewed as an indirect measure of the specificity of the phonological representations used to encode verbal material within the phonological store (Fowler,
1991; Metsala, 1999; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993), as well as a
measure of a general phonological processing ability (see Gathercole et al.,
1991a, p. 388).
Using the logic of Gathercole et al. (1991a, pp. 388, 403), if Block Design
and phonological sensitivity effects were controlled, a significant association of
nonword repetition with concurrent and subsequent receptive vocabulary would
indeed support the claim that the capacity component of phonological memory
contributes directly to vocabulary acquisition. To check the specificity of any
observed link between nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary, parallel
analyses were carried out in relation to phonological sensitivity. If the phonological memory capacity component of nonword repetition did directly contribute
to receptive vocabulary, then a different pattern of results should be obtained if
phonological sensitivity were substituted for nonword repetition. On the other
hand, a finding that phonological sensitivity was as strongly associated with
vocabulary as nonword repetition would suggest that the phonological processing component rather than the capacity component shows the strongest association with vocabulary (see Bowey, 1996, 1997).
Baddeley et al. (1998) claimed that the primary function of phonological
memory is to support language acquisition. To test this claim, children in Ses-

sion 1 were given the Grammatic Understanding subtest of the TOLD-P. The
format of this test is very similar to that of the receptive vocabulary test. In both
tests, children are asked to select one of a series of pictures that illustrates
spoken material. A parallel examination of the patterns of association among
nonword repetition, phonological sensitivity, and receptive grammar provided a
test of Baddeley et al.'s more general claim that phonological memory contributes directly to other aspects of language acquisition.
METHOD
Participants

A group of 97 children (51 boys, 46 girls) was recruited through community
kindergartens for a longitudinal study of reading within a few months of their
fourth birthday. (Age 4 data for these children are not reported here.) The data
used in the present study were obtained one year (Session 1) and two years
(Session 2) after the children were first seen.
Of these children, seven children could not be located when followed up in
Session 1; thus data were obtained for 90 children (47 boys, 43 girls). Complete
data were available for all. Data from two boys receiving speech therapy were
excluded from all analyses. The mean age at Session 1 testing for the 88 children was 58.19 months (SD 1.10). These children obtained a mean standard
score on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) (Dunn &
Dunn, 1981) of 111.05 (SD 15.65).
Session 2 data were collected for 3 of 12 children (10 boys, 2 girls) who
repeated preschool and 68 children who went on to formal schooling. Complete
Session 1 and 2 data were collected from 71 children (36 boys, 35 girls). The
mean age at testing was 71.13 months (SD 1.26). These children obtained a
mean standard score on the PPVT-R of 115.41 (SD 10.88).
Materials and procedure

The present study was initially designed as a three-phase longitudinal study of
beginning reading. Only measures of direct relevance to the association between
nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary are described here. These include
Sessions 1 and 2. The tasks were varied. All children received the same tasks
in the same order, designed to maintain children's interest. All standardized tests
were given according to the test manuals.
Session 1. Session 1 testing was carried out in the children's homes by three
experienced research assistants. Testing commenced with the PPVT-R. This was
followed by the nonword repetition task. Children were introduced to a Christmas tree-shaped finger puppet called Plexi. Plexi was from another planet. Although he could speak English, he wanted to know if it was easy or hard for
the children to say the words in his language. Although Plexi always spoke in
a normal adult voice, clearly and slowly, children were asked to listen carefully.
Live presentation of nonword items was used throughout, and no attempt was

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3

450

made to hide the experimenter's face (see Bowey, 1997; Michas & Henry,
1994). Live presentation of the nonword repetition task is preferable with distractible children (Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996), and the game format increases the task's interest (see Bowey, 1997). Live presentation had been used
by Gathercole et al. (1997, 1999), although visual cues to pronunciation were
usually removed (Gathercole et al., 1997). If the phonological storage capacity
component of nonword repetition did contribute to vocabulary acquisition
(Gathercole et al., 1997), then the availability of lipreading cues to nonword
identity would present a less confounded task (Bowey, 1997).
Children were permitted to ask Plexi to repeat a nonword, but he would not
repeat any item more than once. They were given four practice items (Plexi,
bant, zug, and snet.) After these practice items, Plexi presented the 40 nonword
repetition items used by Gathercole and Baddeley (1989). Half of these items
contained consonant clusters. All nonwords were pronounced according to predetermined standardized pronunciations. The experimenter noted whether children answered correctly, refused to answer, made a consistent articulation substitution error, or were tongue-tied. Items on which the child was tongue-tied
were repeated; incorrect responses did not count as tongue-tied. Items were
very rarely repeated. Similarly, items that reflected consistent substitution errors
(providing that all other phonemes were correctly produced) or that were repeated once were counted as correct in the lenient scoring system. As in Bowey
(1996), lenient nonword repetition scores were computed by allowing children
to request an item to be repeated (once only per item), repeating items on which
children were tongue-tied, and scoring pronunciations that reflected consistent
substitutions as correct. Conservative scores were based on Gathercole et al.'s
(1991a) procedure.
Then children were given a phonological sensitivity task. The 16-item rime
identity task was given before the 16-item phoneme identity task (see the Appendix). These tasks used the same items as those in Bowey (1996). In the
rime identity task, 79.5% of the children obtained maximum scores. In the phoneme identity task, children were told, for instance, that knife ended with /f/ and
were asked, "Which of these ends with a /f/, mop or leaf?" Feedback was extensive, whether the children answered these items correctly or not, and always
included the equivalent information: for example, "Knife and leaf both end
with /f/. Knifffe. Leafff. Leaf ends with /f/. Leafff." Practice items were not
repeated. No feedback was provided for test items. Only data from the phoneme
identity task, which required children to recognize final phoneme identity, were
analyzed (see also Bowey, 1996). On that task, only 14.8% of the children
obtained maximum scores.
Next, children were then given the Block Design subtest of the WPPSI-R;
after a break, they were given two grammatical error imitation and correction
tasks. Children were then given the Grammatic Understanding subtest from the
revised TOLD-P. In this test, children heard a sentence and then selected which
of three pictures matched the sentence. Testing continued until the child made
five consecutive wrong answers. Finally, children were given a reading screening test.

Session 2. Session 2 testing was carried out in the children's homes during
the two-week break between the third and fourth school terms of first grade by
a group of eight research assistants, including two who participated in Session
1. This session was designed primarily as part of the longitudinal study of early
reading development, but included vocabulary and nonword repetition measures.
Testing commenced with the PPVT-R. This was followed by several measures
of early reading skill (letter name and sound knowledge, recognition of common
words, and a standardized word identification test). Then children were given
the Gathercole et al. (1994) nonword repetition test, in which five-syllable nonwords replaced the monosyllabic items from Gathercole and Baddeley (1989).
This was presented again as a game involving the finger puppet and following
the procedure used in Phase 1. Finally, children were given a standardized nonword reading test.
RESULTS

Unless all measures are age-corrected, raw scores (or age-equivalent) scores
should be used in analyzing correlational data. Since nonword repetition and
phonological sensitivity measures could not be age-corrected, raw (or appropriately transformed) scores were used throughout all correlational analyses.
Concurrent correlational results

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the 71 children for whom complete
data were available for both sessions. In Session 1, the mean conservative nonword repetition score was only marginally lower than the mean lenient nonword
repetition score. Lenient and conservative nonword repetition scores were highly
correlated, r(69) = .93, p < .001. An internal consistency analysis, calculated
from a subgroup of 50 children, indicated that the standard 40-item nonword
repetition test was high in internal consistency,  = .85 (based on conservative
scores). The internal consistency of the 16-item phoneme identity test was
slightly lower but adequate,  = .74.
In Session 2, the mean conservative and lenient nonword repetition scores
were virtually identical. These two measures were extremely highly correlated,
r(69) = .99, p < .001. The internal consistency of the nonword repetition test was
also high, as determined from an analysis of the conservative scores of 50 children,  = .83. Nonword repetition performance was quite stable over these two
test sessions, regardless of how it was scored: for lenient nonword repetition,
r(69) = .60, p < .01; for conservative nonword repetition, r(69) = .64, p < .01.
These reliability values were directly comparable to that of vocabulary age,
r(69) = .66, p < .01.
Preliminary checks were made to ensure that the variables were normally
distributed and that there were no multivariate outliers. Negative skewness in
Session 1 nonword repetition was reduced by the use of reflect and square root
transformations. These scores were then multiplied by -1, so that higher scores
indicated higher performance. Transformed lenient and conservative nonword

repetition scores were highly correlated, r(69) = .93. Transformed scores were
used in all subsequent data analyses.
An inspection of the correlations among experimental measures revealed consistent correlations among all Session 1 and all Session 2 performance measures
(see Table 2). Both measures of nonword repetition were reliably correlated
with all other performance measures. The highest correlations with nonword
repetition were observed for phoneme identity. The generally nonsignificant correlations between age and performance measures reflected the very narrow age
band we sampled. Subsequent analyses do not include age effects.
Multiple regression analyses

Two series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to determine whether nonword repetition was associated with receptive vocabulary,
when the contribution of performance IQ was statistically controlled. To check
the specificity of these findings, parallel analyses were conducted, substituting
phoneme identity for nonword repetition and a measure of receptive grammar
(Grammatic Understanding [raw scores]) for vocabulary age.
Analyses of receptive vocabulary. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that Block Design accounted for 6% of the variation in children's vocabulary age (see Table 3). When these effects were controlled, nonword repetition
accounted for 6% to 7% of additional variation in receptive vocabulary when
entered at step 2, regardless of how it was scored. However, nonword repetition
did not account for significant variation after age, Block Design, and phoneme
identity effects were controlled. When entered at step 2, phoneme identity ac-

accounted for 5% to 7% of the variation in receptive grammar, nonword repetition did not account for significant variation when phoneme identity effects
were also controlled. When phoneme identity was substituted for nonword repetition, it accounted for 15% of the variation when entered at step 2 (see Table
4) and for 10% to 11% of the variation after nonword repetition effects had also
been controlled.
Predicting Session 2 performance from Session 1 performance

Table 2 shows that vocabulary was correlated with nonword repetition, both
within and across Sessions 1 and 2. In terms of simple correlations, Session 1
nonword repetition predicted Session 2 vocabulary, and Session 1 vocabulary
predicted Session 2 nonword repetition. These correlations are directly comparable in size. However, Session 1 phoneme identity predicted Session 2 vocabulary just as well as did Session 1 nonword repetition, although Session 1 phoneme identity predicted Session 2 nonword repetition less well than did Session
1 vocabulary. (Session 1 Grammatic Understanding also predicted Session 2
vocabulary and nonword repetition.)
A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses examined Session 1 predictors of Session 2 receptive vocabulary (see Table 5). Session 1 vocabulary
age was entered at step 1 to control for autoregression effects, and Session 1
Block Design (raw scores) was entered at step 2. These two variables accounted
for 47% of the variation in Session 2 vocabulary age. Session 1 nonword repetition (transformed scores) accounted for significant variation (4% to 6%) at step

3, as did Session 1 phoneme identity (4%). Only in the lenient score analysis
did nonword repetition account for significant variation (4%) at step 4 after
phoneme identity effects were controlled. Grammatic Understanding also accounted for significant variation (4%) at step 4 after phoneme identity effects
were controlled. This variation in Session 2 vocabulary age was largely independent of that accounted for by phoneme identity. (At step 3, Grammatic Understanding accounted for 6.7% of the variation in Session 2 vocabulary age scores,
F[1, 67] = 9.72, p < .01.) It was also largely independent of the variation explained by nonword repetition (see Table 5). Thus, even when entered at step
5, after all other effects were controlled, both Grammatical Understanding and
the lenient nonword repetition measure accounted for unique variation in Session 2 vocabulary.
Parallel hierarchical multiple regression analyses examined Session 1 predictors of Session 2 nonword repetition (see Table 6). Session 1 nonword repetition
(transformed scores) was entered at step 1 to control for autoregression effects,
and Session 1 Block Design was entered at step 2. These two variables accounted for 35% to 41% of the variation in Session 2 nonword repetition (transformed scores). Session 1 phoneme identity did not explain significant variation
at step 3. Session 1 vocabulary age accounted for significant variation (7% to
8%) at step 4. Grammatic Understanding did not explain significant variation,
even at step 3.
DISCUSSION

The present study examined both concurrent and predictive associations between nonword repetition and receptive vocabulary in young children. The re-

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3
Bowey: Nonword repetition and vocabulary

457

sults are broadly consistent with the view that phonological sensitivity and nonword repetition constitute surface manifestations of a general phonological
processing ability, which may partly reflect the quality of phonological representation within the language module. This, in turn, may reflect the extent to which
vocabulary has been phonemically restructured (Fowler, 1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993). Because the present study offers qualified support for
the suggestion that the phonological memory capacity component of nonword
repetition contributes directly to receptive vocabulary, the overall findings are
most consistent with the reciprocal view of the association between nonword
repetition and receptive vocabulary proposed by Brown and Hulme (1996).

Concurrent correlational data

Although the concurrent correlational data from Session 1 cannot be interpreted
causally, they shed light on the specificity of the association between nonword
repetition and receptive vocabulary (see Bowey, 1996; Gathercole et al., 1991a;
Metsala, 1999) and reinforce the suggestion that nonword repetition incorporates
a substantial phonological processing component.
In Session 1, nonword repetition was significantly correlated with receptive
vocabulary. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that, with the effects of Block Design controlled, nonword repetition explained significant additional variation in both concurrent vocabulary age (6% to 7%). This finding is
typical of previous work. Most studies using the standard nonword repetition
test introduced by Gathercole and Baddeley (1989) have found that nonword
repetition accounted for significant variation in receptive vocabulary after intelligence was controlled (Bowey, 1996; Gathercole et al., 1991a; Gathercole et
al., 1992; see also Hansen & Bowey, 1994), although exceptions have been
observed at 3 and 5 years of age in the longitudinal study of Gathercole and
Adams (1993, 1994; partial correlations derived from their data).
However, the specificity of this association is open to question. With Block
Design effects controlled, phoneme identity accounted for a substantial amount
of the variation (10%) in receptive vocabulary in Session 1. Phoneme identity
also explained some additional variation in receptive vocabulary (5% to 6%),
even after nonword repetition effects were also controlled. However, when the
effects of Block Design and phoneme identity were controlled, nonword repetition did not explain significant additional variation in concurrent vocabulary age
(1% to 2%).
This pattern of results differs from that reported by Gathercole et al. (1991a)
for groups of 4- and 5-year-olds. However, in their 5-year-old group, Gathercole
et al.'s findings could reflect a lack of statistical power, with rhyme oddity
and nonword repetition actually explaining very similar amounts of variation in
receptive vocabulary after the effects of age and Raven's Matrices were controlled (6.6% and 7.6%, respectively; see Bowey, 1996). The present findings
generally replicate those observed by Bowey (1996) in the larger group of 5year-olds. Similar results have been reported by Metsala (1999) with both 3year-olds and 4- and 5-year-olds. They are consistent with the notion that both

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3
Bowey: Nonword repetition and vocabulary

458

nonword repetition and phoneme identity measures incorporate a common phonological processing ability.
In Session 1, when Block Design effects were controlled, both nonword repetition (5% to 7%) and phonological sensitivity (15%) accounted for significant
variation in receptive grammar. The present findings show a stronger association
between nonword repetition and receptive grammar than that observed by Bowey (1996), who found that, when age and Block Design effects were controlled, phoneme identity accounted for 5% of the variation in Grammatic Understanding of 5-year-olds; nonword repetition did not (1%). Nevertheless, the
present findings replicated Bowey (1996) in suggesting a stronger link between
phoneme identity and receptive grammar than between nonword repetition and
receptive grammar. In the present study, phoneme identity explained significant
variation in receptive grammar (10% to 11%), even when nonword repetition
was also controlled. However, when phoneme identity was also controlled, nonword repetition did not explain unique variation in receptive grammar at step 3
(see Table 4). This finding poses difficulties for Baddeley et al.'s (1998) claim
that phonological memory capacity contributes to the acquisition of grammar.
There are now four studies by two independent research teams (the present
study; Bowey, 1996; Metsala, 1999) that have found that nonword repetition
is no more strongly correlated with receptive vocabulary or grammar than is
phonological sensitivity. These findings alone suggest the need for extreme caution in interpreting the outcomes of hierarchical multiple regression analyses
that use more limited sets of variables - especially when those outcomes are
consistent with particular hypotheses about the causal contribution of one skill
to another (see also Bowey, 1996).
Overall, the present findings are quite consistent with the suggestion that the
association between nonword repetition and vocabulary in 5-year-olds largely
reflects the common association with a latent phonological processing ability,
which itself partly reflects the quality of phonological representations available
within phonological processing tasks (Fowler, 1991; Metsala, 1999). This ability
is also manifest in age-appropriate measures of phonological sensitivity; moreover, phoneme identity appears to be at least as good a measure of this underlying ability as is nonword repetition (see also Bowey, 1996). Furthermore, although the concurrent Session 1 data cannot be interpreted causally, the relative
strengths of the associations among vocabulary, nonword repetition, and phonological sensitivity are inconsistent with any simple hypothesis regarding the direct contribution of phonological memory capacity, as reflected in nonword repetition, to children's vocabulary (or grammatical) development. However, for a
more definitive test of this hypothesis, we must turn to the cross-session predictive analyses.
Predictive data

The present cross-phase data showed that, when autoregression and Block Design effects were controlled, Session 1 nonword repetition predicted significant
variation in Session 2 receptive vocabulary (see Table 5). This result provides
the strongest evidence yet observed that nonword repetition predicts subsequent

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3

459

vocabulary development after 5 years of age. Most of Gathercole and Baddeley's previous predictive work has failed to control autoregression effects. With
one exception (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989), when autoregression and intelligence effects are both controlled, nonword repetition has failed to predict subsequent vocabulary (Gathercole et al., 1992; Gathercole, 1995). In their longitudinal study of children at ages 4, 5, 6, and 8, Gathercole et al. (1992) found that
nonword repetition measured at age 4 predicted receptive vocabulary at age 5,
even when the effects of Raven's Matrices and vocabulary at age 4 were controlled. This was not true of the other two cross-phase analyses. Furthermore,
in an independent longitudinal study, repetition of neither less wordlike nonwords nor more wordlike nonwords at age 4 predicted scores on a composite
vocabulary measure at age 5, once autoregression effects were partialed out
(Gathercole, 1995; see Bowey, 1996).
However, the present cross-phase data showed that, when autoregression and
Block Design effects were controlled, all Session 1 verbal abilities predicted
Session 2 receptive vocabulary (see Table 5). Such findings are consistent with
the lexical restructuring account. They suggest that even predictive associations
between nonword repetition and subsequent vocabulary must, in isolation, be
regarded as inconclusive, regardless of whether autoregression and intelligence
effects are also controlled.
Moreover, with only one exception, the present results indicated that phoneme
identity and nonword repetition were redundant in explaining variation in subsequent vocabulary, once autoregression and performance IQ effects were controlled.
Although both nonword repetition and phoneme identity predicted subsequent vocabulary after autoregression and Block Design effects were controlled, only nonword repetition (leniently scored) accounted for significant variation (4%) in subsequent vocabulary. When the conservative scoring criterion was used, Session 1
nonword repetition accounted for no unique variation in Session 2 vocabulary age
(2%; p = .105), once autoregression, Block Design, and phoneme identity effects
were also controlled (see Table 5). Session 1 phoneme identity did not account
for significant variation in Session 2 vocabulary after autoregression, Block Design, and nonword repetition effects were controlled (see Table 5).
Since the lenient and conservative nonword repetition scores were extremely
highly correlated at both phases, it is difficult to interpret the differences in
outcomes observed with the two measures. Parallel patterns of findings, using
both scoring criteria, were found in all other analyses and in an independent
study using similar measures, reported by Bowey (1996). Note that even the
finding that nonword repetition predicts subsequent vocabulary, after both autoregression and intelligence effects are controlled, has only been observed once
before, by Gathercole and Baddeley (1989). In this context, the unreliability of
the present findings may be viewed as reflecting the relatively small independent contribution made by phonological memory capacity to receptive vocabulary. Thus, the finding that the leniently scored nonword repetition measure
explained significant variation in subsequent vocabulary, after the appropriate
controls, should be regarded with caution. It requires replication. Although qualified, it should be noted that the present finding, in relation to the leniently
scored nonword repetition measure, constitutes the only unambiguous support

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3

460

yet observed within longitudinal correlational research for the hypothesis that
the capacity component of phonological memory contributes directly to vocabulary acquisition.
No previous longitudinal studies controlled the contribution of more general
phonological processing abilities. The present findings (and those of Bowey,
1996; Metsala, 1999) point to the need to do so in future work that examines
nonword repetition in relation to language development. Until this is done, even
longitudinal studies do not allow us to choose between the phonological memory capacity and lexical restructuring accounts of the association between nonword repetition and vocabulary.
Future work may well show stronger contributions of phonological memory
capacity to vocabulary acquisition. The present work (and that of Bowey, 1996;
Metsala, 1999) strongly suggests that the nonword repetition task does reflect
more general phonological processing abilities in young children. Thus, it is
inadvisable to use nonword repetition as the sole measure of phonological memory capacity in young children (cf. Baddeley et al., 1998). Despite the contribution of long-term memory to performance on span tasks (see Brown & Hulme,
1995), it may be preferable in future studies to test the association between
vocabulary and phonological memory capacity using composite measures that
not only include nonword repetition but also span for common words. Such
studies still need to control for more general phonological processing ability.
Grammatic Understanding accounted for a small but significant amount of
variation in Session 2 vocabulary age (4%), even after the effects of all other
Session 1 measures were controlled (see Table 5). It could be argued that the
phonological memory capacity component of Grammatic Understanding (see
Shankweiler & Crain, 1986) contributed to its prediction of subsequent vocabulary. However, this seems unlikely. According to such an account, nonword
repetition would explain unique variation in concurrent receptive grammar, once
Block Design and phoneme identity effects were controlled. However, this was
not observed in Session 1 (see also Bowey, 1996). And, if the contributions to
vocabulary made by Grammatic Understanding and nonword repetition (after
phoneme identity scores were also controlled) both reflected phonological memory capacity, then we would expect the additional variation in vocabulary, accounted for by Grammatic Understanding, to be reduced when nonword repetition effects were also controlled. However, the variation in receptive vocabulary
explained by nonword repetition (lenient scores) and Grammatic Understanding
in the final two steps of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses presented
in Table 5 was largely independent.
Our finding that, when the appropriate effects were controlled, only Session
1 receptive vocabulary predicted Session 2 nonword repetition provided the
strongest evidence of a specific association between nonword repetition and
receptive vocabulary. When autoregression and Session 1 Block Design effects
were controlled, vocabulary in Session 1 predicted nonword repetition in Session 2 (7% to 8%) (see Table 6). Previous work that examined prediction of
nonword repetition from prior receptive vocabulary has not produced consistent
results. When age, Raven's Matrices, and autoregression effects were controlled,
receptive vocabulary at age 4 did not predict nonword repetition at age 5 (Gath-

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3
Bowey: Nonword repetition and vocabulary

461

ercole et al., 1992). However, with the same effects partialed out, receptive
vocabulary at ages 5 and 6 predicted nonword repetition at ages 6 and 8, respectively (Gathercole et al., 1992). In an independent study (Gathercole, 1995),
when autoregression effects were controlled, a composite vocabulary measure
at age 4 predicted repetition of more wordlike nonwords at age 5, but not repetition of less wordlike nonwords at age 5.
In line with the lexical restructuring model, it would appear that, at 5 years
of age, receptive vocabulary does contribute to subsequent nonword repetition
(see also Gathercole et al., 1992). Older children may use their receptive vocabulary as a kind of lexical scaffold to assist their encoding and retrieval of more
wordlike nonwords in verbal working memory (see Dollaghan et al., 1995;
Gathercole et al., 1992; Snowling et al., 1991). However, phonological knowledge, derived from the restructuring of their vocabularies, would also assist
them in forming, maintaining, and retrieving representations of nonwords that
do not contain familiar sublexical or lexical units (Bowey, 1996; Brown &
Hulme, 1996; Fowler, 1991; Metsala, 1999; see also Gathercole et al., 1999).
Thus, the present finding, like those previously reported by Gathercole et al.
(1992) in children between 5 and 8 years, is consistent with the view that vocabulary provides a stimulus to the phonological reorganization of the lexicon
(Fowler, 1991; Metsala, 1999; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993), which,
in turn, enhances the quality of the phonological representations used to encode
and store verbal material within the phonological store (Fowler, 1991; Metsala,
1999).
According to the lexical restructuring hypothesis, both phoneme identity and
nonword repetition, measured in Session 1, partly reflect the current (Session 1)
state of reorganization of phonological representations underlying vocabulary at
a slightly earlier point in time (Fowler, 1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998). Metsala
and Walley (1998, p. 108) explicitly noted that this view predicts a "close relationship between changing lexical representation and phonemic awareness, with
the latter delayed relative to the former." The same is largely true of nonword
repetition (Fowler, 1991); both incorporate substantial phonological processing
components that partly reflect the clarity of phonological representations in both
short-term and long-term memory.
Similar proposals have often been made to explain why children with wordreading difficulties experience problems on virtually any task that requires them
to process phonological information, although sometimes the experimental tasks
must be fairly demanding to reveal these deficits (for reviews, see Brady, 1991;
Fowler, 1991; Share, 1995; Stanovich, 1991; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). Thus,
although studies do not uniformly reveal significant group differences on all of
these tasks, it is nevertheless widely concluded that most children who are less
skilled readers experience subtle difficulties in speech perception (see Brady, 1997;
Metsala, 1997b; Share, 1995), nonword repetition (see Brady, 1997; Snowling,
1981; Snowling et al., 1986), verbal memory span (see Brady, 1991, 1997; Jorm,
1983; Share, 1995), phonological sensitivity (see Brady, 1991; Share, 1995; Stanovich, 1991), and articulation (see Torgesen, Wagner, Simmons, & Laughon,
1990), in addition to their hallmark difficulties in pseudoword decoding (see
Ijzendoorn & Bus, 1994; Rack, Snowling, & Olson, 1992). These findings have

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3
Bowey: Nonword repetition and vocabulary

462

been widely interpreted as indicating that a latent phonological processing ability underlies children's reading problems and performance on a wide variety
of language tasks (e.g., Brady, 1991; Fowler, 1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998;
Shankweiler & Crain, 1986; Share, 1995; Stanovich, 1991; Wagner, Torgesen,
Laughon, Simmons, & Rashotte, 1993). For instance, the heritable variance in
single-word reading appears to be associated with heritable variance in pseudoword decoding (Olson, Gillis, Rack, DeFries, & Fulker, 1991; Olson, Wise,
Conners, Rack, & Fulker, 1989). The latter heritable variance appears, in turn,
to be associated with heritable variance in phonological sensitivity (Olson et al.,
1989).
Evidence that children with specific language impairments experience difficulties with nonword repetition (see Baddeley et al., 1998) can be similarly
interpreted. Such findings do not themselves imply that phonological memory
capacity deficits directly cause specific language impairment. For instance, the
finding that nonword repetition and phonological sensitivity deficits remain in the
face of resolved language impairments (Bishop et al., 1996; Stothard, Snowling,
Bishop, Chipchase, & Kaplan, 1998) suggests that it is unlikely that phonological
memory deficits per se are a direct cause of specific language impairment, but
that phonological memory deficits may constitute a surface manifestation of an
underlying phonological processing deficit that contributes to specific language
impairment.
This account of phoneme sensitivity and nonword repetition as partly measuring common underlying phonological processing abilities explains why Session
1 phoneme identity failed to predict Session 2 nonword repetition (after the
appropriate effects were controlled). Nonword repetition and phoneme identity
are both indirect, delayed measures of the current state of phonological reorganization of the lexicon (Fowler, 1991; Metsala & Walley, 1998), thus explaining
largely redundant variation in concurrent receptive vocabulary (Session 1; see
also Bowey, 1996, Metsala, 1999). Thus, once Session 1 nonword repetition
effects are statistically controlled, Session 1 phoneme identity can add little to
the prediction of subsequent nonword repetition. In other words, if vocabulary
acquisition is driving the process of phonological reorganization (Fowler, 1991;
Metsala, 1999; Metsala & Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993), then Session 1 vocabulary should provide a better estimate of the future state of phonological reorganization and processing skill underlying Session 2 nonword repetition than Session 1 phoneme identity (see Metsala & Walley, 1998, p. 108). Indeed, the
present data suggest that it does.
Such an argument accounts for both the nonsignificant contribution of Session
1 phoneme identity to Session 2 nonword repetition, when Block Design and
autoregression effects were controlled (see Table 6), and the relatively small
amount of variation in Session 2 vocabulary explained by Session 1 phoneme
identity (4%) and nonword repetition (4% to 6%), once autoregression and
Block Design effects were controlled (see Table 5) (see also Bowey, 1996). It
also permits the interpretation of the finding that leniently scored Session 1
nonword repetition nevertheless managed to account for some unique variation
in Session 2 vocabulary: presumably the unique contribution of nonword repetition reflects the contribution of its phonological memory capacity component.

Applied Psycholinguistics 22:3
Bowey: Nonword repetition and vocabulary

463

However, this interpretation needs to be regarded with some caution at this
stage, as its reliability needs to be demonstrated.
According to the lexical restructuring model, both phoneme identity and nonword repetition, measured in Session 1, partly provide an indirect and delayed
measure of the state of reorganization of phonological representations underlying vocabulary at a slightly earlier point in time. Thus, the lexical restructuring
model would predict parallel findings in the prediction of later phonological
sensitivity from earlier receptive vocabulary and nonword repetition. That is,
the lexical restructuring model would predict that, with autoregression and
Block Design effects controlled, receptive vocabulary, but not nonword repetition, could account for unique variation in subsequent phonological sensitivity.
This finding would support the present finding that, with autoregression and
Block Design effects controlled, receptive vocabulary, but not phonological sensitivity, could account for unique variation in subsequent nonword repetition.
However, because no phonological sensitivity measure was included in Session
2, this issue could not be directly investigated in the present study. This prediction remains to be investigated.
Conclusions

Strong support was shown in the present study for the hypothesis that the concurrent association between nonword repetition and vocabulary is mediated by
an underlying phonological processing ability, which may partly reflect the
quality of phonological representation available within the language module.
Nonword repetition and phoneme sensitivity both reflect that ability. Furthermore, as predicted by the lexical restructuring hypothesis, vocabulary predicted
substantial unique variation in subsequent nonword repetition. Qualified support
was observed for the hypothesis that the phonological memory capacity component of the nonword repetition task would contribute directly to receptive vocabulary in young children in the present study. All in all, these results support a
reciprocal association between nonword repetition and vocabulary, as outlined
by Brown and Hulme (1996).
Overall, the present results support those of Bowey (1996) and Metsala
(1999) in suggesting that Baddeley et al. (1998) may have overestimated the
direct contribution of phonological memory capacity to young children's vocabulary development. Nonword repetition clearly incorporates a substantial phonological processing component that may cause difficulty for young children. The
use of parallel measures of phonological processing and general verbal abilities
here revealed that, unless differential patterns of association consistent with specific causal hypotheses can be clearly demonstrated, great caution should be
exercised when interpreting the findings from studies that investigated the contribution of nonword repetition to language acquisition (see also Bowey, 1996;
Metsala, 1999). These findings are entirely compatible with the lexical restructuring view that vocabulary growth stimulates a prolonged process of phonological development, which culminates in the efficient encoding of lexical items
and newly encountered verbal material that is available for use in verbal working memory tasks.

464

Nevertheless, there is some evidence within the present study to support the
hypothesis of a reciprocal association between nonword repetition and receptive
vocabulary. Furthermore, other work using different paradigms suggests that
phonological memory capacity does contribute to vocabulary acquisition (e.g.,
Gathercole et al., 1997). It is, therefore, quite likely that further longitudinal
work using younger children will provide stronger evidence of a direct contribution of phonological memory capacity to vocabulary acquisition. When autoregression effects are controlled, the strongest evidence to date concerning the
contribution of nonword repetition to vocabulary development has been observed in children from 4 to 6 years of age (Gathercole et al., 1992; but see
Gathercole, 1995; Metsala, 1999). However, it is critical that future studies employ age-appropriate control measures of phonological processing. As the present findings clearly demonstrated, without such measures future findings will
not be clearly interpretable.
Future work should also test the hypothesis that vocabulary growth stimulates
phonological development, thus leading to increases in performance on gating
tasks (e.g., Metsala, 1997a) and on early indexes of phonological sensitivity, as
well as nonword repetition. Given the difficulty of testing young children, composite measures of these skills should be used wherever possible to reduce measurement error. Other work has suggested that speech perception abilities may
contribute directly to the emergence of phonemic sensitivity in kindergarten
children (McBride-Chang, Wagner, & Chang, 1997). Thus, it may be possible
to trace the associations among age-appropriate measures of speech perception,
phonological sensitivity, nonword repetition, and receptive vocabulary longitudinally (see Walley, 1993).

NOTES
1. Baddeley et al. (1998) noted that performance on the nonword repetition task "is
constrained by the quality of the phonological representation of the just-spoken unfamiliar item. In other words, nonword repetition provides a measure of the phonological store, not phonological rehearsal" (p. 168). This is the only acknowledgment in
that article that nonword repetition includes a strong initial phonological encoding
component, in a review that specifically examines the nature of the association between nonword repetition and vocabulary acquisition. Elsewhere, the locus of the
association with respect to the phonological loop is uniformly attributed to storage
capacity (e.g., pp. 159, 161).

2. Production does not necessarily reflect the phonological representation of words
within the input lexicon, particularly in very young children. There may be a need
to distinguish between input and output lexicons, which can mutually influence each
other, although impairments in the input lexicon result in inaccurate output in the
child. Units of production may differ from units of perception. For ease of exposition, this distinction is not elaborated upon in the text.
