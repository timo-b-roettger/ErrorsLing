a b s t r a c t
The present study aimed to investigate neurophysiological substrates of phoneme and word processing in
10 patients with acute aphasia (PWA). More specifically, phoneme discrimination was studied in a passive and active oddball task with respect to different phonemic contrasts, while lexical detection was
investigated by presenting infrequent pseudowords among frequent words in a passive oddball task.
Concerning phoneme discrimination, PWA in the acute stage had smaller MMN and P300 amplitudes
than the norm group for voicing, whereas for place and manner they only demonstrated smaller P300
amplitudes. PWA showed a distinct pattern of impaired phonemic contrast sensitivity, with place displaying the largest amplitude and voicing the smallest. Concerning lexical detection, pseudowords elicited larger responses than words in both groups, but with a delay and larger P200 amplitude for
pseudowords in PWA compared to the norm group. For clinical practice, passive tasks seem more suitable
than active tasks in acute aphasia.

1. Introduction
Deficits in phonological and lexical input processes can cause a
destabilization in the consecutive language process, as they form
part of the first processing steps in language comprehension
(Pulvermuller, Shtyrov, & Hauk, 2009). The ability to detect and
discern different phonemes from each other and subsequently
use the outcome of this process in successive stages like word
recognition and comprehension is often disturbed in patients with
aphasia (Blumstein, Baker, & Goodglass, 1977; Mirman, Yee,
Blumstein, & Magnuson, 2011; Robson, Keidel, Lambon Ralph, &
Sage, 2012).
Event-related
potentials
(ERPs),
especially
the
oddball-paradigm based studies, have a great potential in characterizing, evaluating and monitoring these specific phonological
problems in patients with aphasia. The pre-attentive Mismatch
Negativity (MMN) (Naatanen, Gaillard, & Mantysalo, 1978) and
the attentive P300 potential (Sutton, Braren, Zubin, & John, 1965)
are very suitable to gauge auditory discrimination and these ERPs

are already demonstrated to be a good measure for monitoring
recovery patterns in early stages of aphasia and long-term
follow-up periods (Ilvonen et al., 2003; Nolfe, Cobianchi,
Mossuto-Agatiello, & Giaquinto, 2006). In general, the MMN is
more reduced in patients with aphasia for speech sound changes
(vowels, phonemes) than tone stimuli differing in frequency or
duration, potentially because tone stimuli activate different cortical generators than the speech stimuli (Aaltonen, Tuomainen,
Laine, & Niemi, 1993; Csepe, Osman-Sagi, Molnar, & Gosy, 2001;
Ilvonen et al., 2004; Wertz et al., 1998). Within speech sound discrimination, consonant contrasts elicit a more distorted MMN and
attenuated amplitude than vowel contrasts in patients with aphasia (Csepe et al., 2001), perhaps due to the clear acoustic relation
between the first three formant frequencies for different vowels.
Especially discrimination of the phonemic contrast voicing is neurophysiologically reflected by a total absence of the MMN in
patients with aphasia, whereas a difference in place of articulation
elicits a MMN, yet heavily distorted and with an abnormal scalp
distribution (Csepe et al., 2001). The effect of degree of difference
between the standard and deviant stimulus is also reflected in
the P300 potential. A study by Becker and Reinvang (2007b) compared patients with aphasia with mild or moderate auditory comprehension impairment and patients with aphasia with severe or
very severe auditory comprehension impairment during an active

A. Aerts et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 84-96

auditory discrimination task. No significant differences in P300
amplitude between the two aphasia groups and a healthy control
group could be established. This was most likely related to the relatively low difficulty of the behavioural task (every patient completed the task correctly) and the fact that the standard and
deviant speech stimuli differed in more than one phonemic contrast, e.g. voicing and place of articulation (Becker & Reinvang,
2007b).
The MMN and P300 have also been applied to evaluate auditory
word processing in patients with aphasia. When the neurophysiological response to real words and pseudowords is compared in
healthy controls, either a MMN is elicited with a larger negativity
to real words during a passive discrimination task or a P300-like
ERP emerges with a larger positivity to real words during an active
discrimination task, both referred to as a ``real word advantage''
(Pulvermuller et al., 2001; Shtyrov & Pulvermuller, 2002). The
MMN is often attenuated in response to both real words and pseudowords in patients with aphasia, but despite these attenuated
responses a similar significant ``real word advantage'' as previously
evidenced in healthy controls is still present (Pettigrew et al.,
2005). This is not necessarily the case for the P300 potential, which
can be reduced in response to real words in patients with
aphasia during a visual word discrimination task, thereby
presenting a smaller positivity to real words than to pseudowords
(Pulvermuller, Mohr, & Lutzenberger, 2004). The early
word-evoked MMN can also be used to monitor neuronal recovery
patterns in patients with aphasia, whether or not in the context of
treatment effects. Re-enhanced neurophysiological responses to
real words after treatment can indicate recovery in chronic
patients with aphasia and has even been referred to as an ``aphasia
recovery potential'' (Pulvermuller, Hauk, Zohsel, Neininger, &
Mohr, 2005). This is of great relevance, also with respect to laterality patterns as it has been established that different laterality patterns can arise throughout the recovery from stroke (Saur et al.,
2006). The MMN and P300 can be used to explore hemispherical
distribution of brain activity, which allows for determining potential contralesional contributions to auditory discrimination processes (Becker & Reinvang, 2007a; Becker & Reinvang, 2007b;
Ilvonen et al., 2003).
Despite the great knowledge these group studies have provided
on the neurophysiological substrate of phonological disorders in
patients with aphasia, they do not seem to control for the large
heterogeneity existent in such a patient population. Nonetheless,
this is a factor to be taken into account, as the structural brain
alterations due to the stroke in patients with aphasia can differ significantly from patient to patient. The fact that a group study by
Becker and Reinvang (2007a) failed to find significant MMN amplitude reductions to phonemes and tones in patients with aphasia,
while this was found in other studies (Ilvonen et al., 2004;
Pettigrew et al., 2005; Wertz et al., 1998), might be interpreted
as a potential lack of controlling for the large variability among
patients with aphasia. This denotes the risk of neglecting the
heterogeneity and variability within a group of patients with aphasia, especially when taking into account a general individual variability in healthy functional brain activation patterns (Burton,
Noll, & Small, 2001) and recent findings of significant age-related
influences on ERPs in healthy subjects (Aerts et al., 2013). When
one wants to practically implement event-related potentials in
the linguistic evaluation of patients with aphasia and subsequently
make justified decisions when interpreting these ERPs, controlling
for heterogeneity and variability is an important issue that should
not be disregarded. A second remarkable observation from the literature is that only a few studies have investigated patients with
aphasia in the acute stage of stroke (e.g. within 2 weeks after
stroke) (Ilvonen et al., 2003; Nolfe et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it is
highly likely that extensive behavioural evaluation is problematic

85

or even impossible at this stage of stroke due to severe comprehension problems (Ilvonen et al., 2003). When this is the case, especially the ERPs that can be elicited with a simple passive oddball
task in which no explicit cooperation of the patient is required,
such as the MMN, can provide a means for counteracting this practical problem.
The
present
study
aims
to
characterize
specific
language-related neurophysiological activation patterns in
patients with aphasia in the acute stage of stroke (within 2 weeks
after stroke), while explicitly controlling for group heterogeneity
and variability. First, auditory phoneme discrimination based on
three different phonemic contrasts (place of articulation (PoA),
manner of articulation (MoA) and voicing) is investigated with a
pre-attentive (MMN) and attentive (P300) oddball task, to additionally explore the effects of attention and the possibility of using
active oddball tasks in patients with aphasia at the acute stage of
stroke. Second, pre-attentive auditory lexical detection is investigated by including a Real Word/Pseudoword pre-attentive discrimination oddball task. Third, it is examined whether a correlation
exists between neurophysiological and behavioural results in
patients with aphasia at the acute stage of stroke.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Subjects
Ten patients with aphasia (5 men, 5 women) were recruited from
the Hospitalization department of Neurology at Ghent University
Hospital (Belgium) and were compared to 44 healthy control participants (20 men, 24 women) (Aerts, van Mierlo, Hartsuiker, Santens,
& De Letter, 2015). All patients (1) suffering from a first-ever stroke
in the left hemisphere, (2) having Dutch as their native language and
(3) displaying acute phonological disorders as established with the
Psycholinguistic Assessment of Language Processing in Aphasia
(PALPA) (Bastiaanse, Bosje, & Visch-Brink, 1995) were included in
the study. Patients with aphasia admitted with (1) a recurrent
stroke, (2) left handedness, as confirmed with the Dutch
Handedness Inventory (DHI) (Van Strien, 1992), (3) indications for
comorbid cognitive disorders, which was screened with MMSE
(Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) in patients above 70 years
and (4) severe hearing deficits as reported by patients themselves
or judged by the examiner were excluded from the study. The complete test battery (ERP and behavioural tests) was administered in
the acute stage (within two weeks after stroke). The mean age of
the patients was 69.4 years (3.46 SD), ranging between 46 and
85 years. Patient characteristics with regard to gender, age, education, type of aphasia, behavioural test scores, site of lesion, etiology
and exact time post injury are represented in Table 1. MRIs of the
patients' lesions are displayed in Fig. 1. The norm group showed
an equivalent age distribution between men (mean: 45.60 years
13.67) and women (mean: 44.46 years 13.76). All participants
investigated were right-handed, as verified with the Dutch
Handedness Inventory (DHI; Van Strien, 1992), and had Dutch as
their native language. They reported to have normal hearing and
none of them had neurological, psychiatric or speech- and language
developmental disorders. At the time of testing, none of the participants was on medication. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the University Hospital Ghent and an informed consent was obtained from all the participants (patients and norm
group).

(MMN) and attentive (P300) condition. These tasks were only
administered in 8 (4 men, 4 women) out of 10 patients with aphasia, as 2 patients had to be excluded because of technical malfunction of the hard- and software. During the pre-attentive condition,
the subjects were instructed to ignore the stimuli and to focus their
attention to a silent movie. During the attentive condition, the subjects were asked to push a button every time they heard the infrequent stimulus. Within the pre-attentive and attentive tasks, each
block consisted of 250 and 150 stimuli (consonants followed by the
neutral vowel shwa /o/, to avoid extreme forms of coarticulation),
respectively. The stimuli were created in such a way that the standard and deviant stimulus only differed in one phonemic contrast.
The standard phoneme was /b/ and the deviant phonemes were /g/
(differing in PoA), /p/ (differing in voicing) and /m/ (differing in
MoA), each presented in separate blocks of which the order was
counterbalanced across and within both groups. Stimuli were generated using the website NeXTeNS (http://nextens.uvt.nl/demo.
html) where text could be converted to speech (Marsi, Busser,
Daelemans, Hoste, & Reynaert, 2002). In all stimulus blocks, the
standard and deviant phoneme appeared with a probability of
0.80 and 0.20, respectively. The stimuli were given in a random
order in which two deviants could not follow each other without

having one standard in between. All the spoken stimuli had a duration of 150 ms. The interstimulus interval (ISI) was set at 500 ms in
the MMN paradigm and 2000 ms in the P300 paradigm. The stimuli
were presented binaurally at 70 dB sound pressure level (SPL)
using Apple Inc. earphones placed directly in the external ear.
2.2.2. Auditory lexical detection (ALD)
The second experiment consisted of a pre-attentive lexical
detection task where pseudowords were implemented as deviant
stimuli and real words as standard stimuli and was conducted in
all 10 patients with aphasia. The subjects were instructed to ignore
the stimuli and to focus their attention to a silent movie. The standard stimuli and deviant stimuli appeared with a probability of
0.80 and 0.20, respectively. A total of 125 stimuli were presented,
including 100 different real words and 25 different pseudowords.
The real words were all nouns and selected from the
SUBTLEX-NL database (Keuleers, Brysbaert, & New, 2010) within
a range of 2-4 log10freq lexical frequency. Pseudowords were
derived from 25 real words, randomly selected from the list of
100 real words, by replacing one vowel and one consonant in the
initial and middle position. Substitution of the initial phoneme
already changed the real word into a pseudoword. Stimuli were

A. Aerts et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 84-96

spoken by a 24 year old female Dutch native speaker with a flat
intonation and digitally recorded with a sampling frequency of
44.1 kHz. The stimuli were given in a random order in which two
pseudowords could not follow each other without having one real
word in between. The real words were controlled for lexical frequency (mean 3.15 log10freq) (Keuleers et al., 2010), age of acquisition (mean 6.0 years) (Ghyselinck, Custers, & Brysbaert, 2003)
and length (5 phonemes; 1 or 2 syllables). The stimuli were presented with an ISI of 1000 ms and presented binaurally at 70 dB
sound pressure level (SPL) using Apple Inc. earphones placed
directly in the external ear.
2.3. Electroencephalogram (EEG) - recording and analysis
The EEG (0.5-100 Hz band-pass, notch filter disabled) was
recorded through 23 Ag/AgCl-electrodes using a linked ears reference and an electrode placed on the forehead as ground.
Electrodes were placed on the scalp according to the international
10-20 system. The impedance of the electrodes was kept below
5 kO. Data was collected using a SynAmp (Neuroscan) amplifier
and was continuously digitized at a 500 Hz sampling rate.
EEG analysis was performed using BrainVision Analyzer 2
(Brain Products, Munich, Germany). The EEG signal was filtered
with a 0.5-30 Hz band-pass filter and notch filter enabled at
50 Hz. Using independent component analysis (ICA) artefacts
caused by eye movements were removed by excluding two components (eye blinks; left-right movements) based on inspection of
the components' spatial distribution. For the attentive phoneme
discrimination paradigm the EEG was segmented into 1100 ms
long epochs from 100 ms pre-stimulus to 1000 ms post-stimulus.
For the pre-attentive phoneme discrimination paradigm the EEG
was segmented into 500 ms long epochs from 100 ms
pre-stimulus to 400 ms post-stimulus. Finally, for the
pre-attentive lexical detection paradigm the EEG was segmented
into 1000 ms long epochs from 100 ms pre-stimulus to 900 ms
post-stimulus. The epochs were baseline corrected using a
pre-stimulus window of 100 ms. All epochs containing data
exceeding 100 lV were rejected for further analysis. During the
pre-attentive phoneme discrimination paradigm, in the norm
group an average of 47.80 deviant stimuli was accepted (range:
36-50) for PoA, an average of 47.50 deviant stimuli was accepted
(range: 32-50) for MoA and an average of 49.02 deviant stimuli
was accepted (range: 38-50) for voicing. In the group of patients
with aphasia, an average of 47.13 deviant stimuli was accepted
(range: 40-50) for PoA, an average of 48.88 deviant stimuli was
accepted (range: 46-50) for MoA and an average of 47.75 deviant
stimuli was accepted (range: 39-50) for voicing. During the attentive phoneme discrimination paradigm, in the norm group an average of 26.57 deviant stimuli was accepted (range: 18-30) for PoA,
an average of 25.37 deviant stimuli was accepted (range: 14-30)
for MoA and an average of 26.75 deviant stimuli was accepted
(range: 18-30) for voicing. In the group of patients with aphasia,
an average of 21.75 deviant stimuli was accepted (range: 14-30)
for PoA, an average of 17.75 deviant stimuli was accepted (range:
18-30) for MoA and an average of 21.13 deviant stimuli was
accepted (range: 12-30) for voicing. During the lexical detection
paradigm, in the norm group an average of 24.56 deviant stimuli
(range: 21-25) and an average of 96.47 standard stimuli (range:
80-100) was accepted. In the group of patients with aphasia, an
average of 23.60 deviant stimuli (range: 21-25) and an average
of 95.40 standard stimuli (range: 90-100) was accepted. The standard and deviant trials were averaged separately for every individual. Finally, to compute the MMN in the phoneme discrimination
task the average ERP of the standard trials was subtracted from
the average ERP of the deviant trials. For the P300 potential it is
not necessary to compute a difference waveform (Duncan et al.,

87

2009), so this potential was analysed in the deviant waveform.
Grand average waveforms (GA) were created for each stimulus
and each group separately in which ERP peaks were identified.
Subsequently, time windows were centred around those ERP peaks
and peak amplitudes and latencies were measured in each individual within those time windows. For phoneme discrimination, the
MMN was measured between 140 and 230 ms for PoA, between
160 and 220 ms for MoA and between 80 and 260 ms for voicing.
The P300 was measured between 370 and 650 ms for PoA, between
350 and 510 ms for MoA and between 400 and 570 ms for voicing.
For lexical detection, an early negative ERP was measured between
60 and 140 ms (``N100''), a positive ERP was measured between
140 and 280 ms (``P200'') and a later, broad-going, long-lasting
negative ERP was measured between 400 and 650 ms (``N400'')
in response to the pseudowords and real words. Based on these
GA, six clusters with the average activity/latency of two electrodes
were created, keeping midline electrodes separate: Anterior Left
(AL: F3, F7), Anterior Midline (AM: Fz), Anterior Right (AR: F4,
F8), Central Left (CL: T3, C3), Central Midline (CM: Cz), Central
Right (CR: T4, C4), Posterior Left, (PL: T5, P3) Posterior Midline
(PM: Pz), Posterior Right (PR: T6, P4). To elaborate on possible laterality effects, additional laterality indices (LI) were calculated as
the difference between the mean amplitude of the right and left
anterior, central and posterior clusters (R L) (Spironelli, Angrilli,
& Pertile, 2008). This means that for the negative potentials a positive value indicated left lateralization and a negative value indicated right lateralization. For the positive potentials a positive
value indicated right lateralization and a negative value indicated
left lateralization.
2.4. Behavioural language assessment
Firstly, all subtests of the Dutch version of the Aachen Aphasia
Test (AAT) (Graetz, De Bleser, & Willmes, 1992) were administered
as part of routine linguistic examination and mainly to determine
the type of aphasia. Thereafter, three different subtests of the
PALPA (Bastiaanse et al., 1995) were administered. The phoneme
discrimination tests consisted of a same-different judgment task
in which the participants had to judge whether pairs of pseudowords (PALPA 1) or pairs of real words (PALPA 2) were the same
or not. The patients were instructed to say ``yes'' as a response to a
similar word pair and to say ``no'' to a dissimilar word pair. The
aurally presented stimuli were monosyllabic (pseudo)words of
consonant/vowel/consonant (CVC)-structure. They all differed in
phonemic contrasts voicing, PoA or MoA which were either initial,
final or based on metathesis (i.e. an altered sequence of phonemes). The lexical decision task in the subtest PALPA 5 contained
80 real words and 80 pseudowords. The pseudowords were
derived from the real words by changing one or multiple phonemes, making them legal pseudowords. The participants were
asked to decide after each spoken word whether the stimulus
was a real word or not, by saying ``yes'' to a real word or ``no'' to
a pseudoword. In both tests, the answers of the participants were
written down on a score sheet, giving 1 for correct answers and
0 for wrong answers. The patients in Table 1 were included when
performance on the above mentioned PALPA subtests was 2 SD
below the mean of the normative data (Aerts, Santens, & De
Letter, 2012, unpublished data; Bastiaanse et al., 1995).
2.5. Statistical analysis
The covariance parameters inherent to the group of patients
with aphasia and the norm group were first determined, as a measure for homogeneity within the groups (the larger, the more

explicit chi-square test for homogeneity of covariance parameters

88

across the group of patients with aphasia and the norm group was
performed by imposing equality constraints (based on the
restricted likelihood). More specifically, with this test it was examined whether varying the covariance parameters by the group
effect provides a significantly better fit compared to a model in
which different groups share the same parameter. When significant differences in covariance parameters were detected, significant differences in heterogeneity between groups were
established, and consequently more heterogeneity in one of both
groups. If this was the case, the model assuming the same variance
across the group of patients with aphasia and the norm group was
rejected, the model assuming heterogeneous variances was
retained and the ultimate linear mixed model was adjusted accordingly for the between-group analyses for amplitudes, latencies and
laterality indices of ERPs.
The definitive linear mixed model was carried out with subjects
included as random intercept and residuals. Group (aphasia vs.
norm group) served as between-subject factor. For the phoneme
discrimination task the following factors entered the model: contrasts (PoA vs. voicing vs. MoA)  region (anterior vs. central vs.
posterior)  laterality (left vs. midline vs. right; only for amplitudes and latencies as outcome measures). For the lexical detection
task the same factors were used, though the factor wordness (real
words vs. pseudowords) replaced the factor contrasts. The
within-subject factors (contrasts, wordness, region and laterality)
were only of interest if they interacted with the between-subject
factor group, so significant effects not containing the factor group
were excluded from the model. Significance level was set at

60.05. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were computed using simple effect comparisons with Tukey adjustment. All these statistical
analyses were performed using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.4.
Finally, correlations between amplitudes and latencies of FZ
(MMN; N100, P200, N400), CZ (N100, P200, N400) and PZ (P300)
electrode and two subtests of the AAT (Token Test; Auditory
Language Comprehension), the phoneme discrimination tests
PALPA 1 (total score) and PALPA 2 (total score) and the lexical decision task PALPA 5 (total score, pseudowords and real words) were
calculated with the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient. Considering the large amount of correlations, the significance level was reduced to 60.01. All the correlational analyses
were performed using the CORR procedure in SAS 9.4.

3.1.1.1. MMN.
3.1.1.1.1. Amplitudes. Significantly higher variances and heterogeneity were established in the patients with aphasia (v2 = 55.59,
p < 0.0001).
A

(F(2, 100) = 3.04, p < 0.05) was found. Patients with aphasia showed
smaller amplitudes than the norm group with voicing as the
phonemic contrast (p < 0.01). Moreover, patients with aphasia

showed higher amplitudes for PoA compared to voicing and MoA
(p < 0.05), without a difference between voicing and MoA. The
norm group revealed higher amplitudes for PoA compared to
MoA (p < 0.0001) and equal amplitudes compared to voicing
(p = 0.498).

(v2 = 2.27, p = 0.321). A significant group  contrasts interaction

Fig. 4. Pseudoword effect present in both patients with aphasia and norm group. Throughout the three time windows, patients with aphasia showed larger amplitude in
response to pseudowords compared to real words. Only in the P200 time window significantly larger amplitude emerged in response to the pseudowords in the patients with
aphasia compared to the norm group. Absolute values are represented for the negative potentials for the sake of visibility. RW = real words; PW = pseudowords;  = significant

emerged (F(2, 100) = 78.72, p < 0.0001). Patients with aphasia displayed longer latencies compared to the norm group with voicing
(p < 0.0001) and MoA (p < 0.001) as phonemic contrast, but not
with PoA, and within the patients with aphasia there were significantly longer latencies for voicing, followed by MoA and then
PoA (p < 0.0001), which showed the shortest latencies. The norm
group showed shorter latencies for voicing compared to PoA
(p = 0.001).
3.1.1.1.3. Laterality indices (R-L amplitude). Significantly higher
variances and heterogeneity were established in the patients with
aphasia (v2 = 172.29, p < 0.001). A group  contrasts interaction
(F(2, 100) = 5.53, p < 0.01) showed more negative values in patients
with aphasia than in the norm group, indicating more right lateralized activation, though only for voicing (p < 0.05). Within patients
with aphasia, voicing showed more negative values than PoA, again
indicating more right lateralization for voicing.
3.1.1.2. P300.
3.1.1.2.1. Behavioural results. The norm group identified 97.65% of
the deviant stimuli with PoA as phonemic contrast, with voicing
96.8% and with MoA 98.34% of the deviant stimuli, indicating that
this task was a rather easy one for the norm group. However,
response rate of patients with aphasia for button-press ranged
from 41.37% correct trials (39.77) for PoA, 42.89% correct trials
(31.71) for voicing to 57.37% correct trials (42.06) for MoA.
This indicates that attentive discrimination of all three phonemic
contrasts was difficult for the current group of patients with aphasia, with a large variability among the patients.
3.1.1.2.2. Amplitudes. There were no significant differences in
heterogeneity between the patients with aphasia and the norm
group (v2 = 2.07, p = 0.355). A group  laterality interaction was
found (F(2, 100) = 18.69, p < 0.0001), showing smaller amplitudes
in patients with aphasia than the norm group on the midline, left
and right hemisphere (p < 0.0001). A group  contrasts interaction
(F(2, 100) = 3.67, p = 0.029) showed smaller amplitudes in patients
with aphasia compared to the norm group with all three phonemic
contrasts (p < 0.0001). Among the patients with aphasia larger
amplitudes were established for PoA compared to voicing
(p < 0.01), without a difference between voicing and MoA or PoA
and MoA. The norm group showed larger amplitudes for PoA compared to voicing (p = 0.004) and MoA (p < 0.001).
3.1.1.2.3. Latencies. Significantly higher variances were established
in the patients with aphasia (v2 = 172.29, p < 0.0001). A two-way
group  contrasts interaction was found (F(2, 100) = 12.79,

p < 0.0001), which showed longer latencies in patients with aphasia than in the norm group with all three phonemic contrasts.
Within the patients with aphasia there were significantly longer
latencies for voicing, followed by PoA and then MoA (p < 0.0001),
which showed the shortest latencies. The norm group displayed
shortest latencies for MoA, followed by voicing and then PoA
(p < 0.001).
3.1.1.2.4. Laterality indices (R-L amplitude). There were no significant differences in heterogeneity between the patients with aphasia and the norm group (v2 = 2.78, p = 0.249). No significant main
or interaction effects were detected.
3.1.2. Auditory lexical detection
Mean amplitudes and latencies (and standard deviations) of
N100, P200 and N400 for both groups can be found in Table 2.
Mean amplitudes of N100, P200 and N400 for both groups can also
be found in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the grand average ERP waveforms of
the patients with aphasia compared to the norm group and the
response to the real words and the pseudowords for the patients
with aphasia separately. No clear MMN could be identified in the
difference waveform between real words and pseudowords
(Aerts et al., 2013). When analysing the response to the real words
and pseudowords separately it became clear that the neuronal
reactions to both stimuli were nearly identical in the time window
between 0 ms and 400 ms, explaining the inability to elicit a MMN.
Starting from 400 ms onwards, a negative component between 400
and 600 ms (``N400'') was evoked in response to pseudowords
whereas in response to real words the same component was
observed but with a smaller amplitude (``positive shift''). This
appeared as a very small, less well distinguishable ERP in the difference wave around 500 ms. Therefore, in what follows, the
ERPs to the real words and pseudowords will be further analysed
separately. However, considering the present negative,
broad-going ERP was elicited with a passive oddball task, the
denomination as ``N400'' merely refers to the latency post stimulus
onset and not to the ERP component typically elicited with an
active violation paradigm, which is associated with incongruences
and language comprehension (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas &
Hillyard, 1980).

revealed significantly smaller amplitudes in the posterior compared to the anterior and central regions in both groups

(p < 0.05).

3.1.2.1.2. Latencies. The test of covariance parameters showed significantly higher variances in the patients with aphasia
(v2 = 350.46, p < 0.0001). A two-way group  wordness interaction
was found (F(1, 51) = 4.71, p < 0.05), revealing longer latencies in
patients with aphasia compared to the norm group for pseudowords (p < 0.01) with a trend for real words (p = 0.056), yet
within the group of patients with aphasia no difference was found
between both word types.

3.1.2.2.2. Latencies. The test of covariance parameters showed significantly higher variances in the patients with aphasia
(v2 = 365.13, p < 0.0001). A significant interaction emerged
between group and wordness (F(1, 51) = 8.60, p = 0.005) showing
for both pseudowords and real words longer latencies in patients
with aphasia compared to the norm group (p < 0.05), without a difference between both word types in the patients with aphasia.

3.1.2.2.3. Laterality indices (R-L amplitude). Significantly higher

tendency of more positive values for real words in patients with
aphasia (p = 0.056), implying more right lateralization.

FZ amplitude in response to real words correlated with total score
of PALPA 5. Thirdly, N100 FZ amplitude and P200 FZ latency in
response to pseudowords was associated with the subtest real
words of the PALPA 5. Finally, N400 FZ amplitude in response to
real words and N400 FZ latency in response to pseudowords was
correlated with the subtest pseudowords of the PALPA 5.
4. Discussion
With the present study we aimed to disentangle the neurophysiological correlates of phoneme and word processing in the acute
stage of aphasia (<2 weeks after stroke) and compare them with
a norm group, while taking the large variability and heterogeneity
among patients with aphasia into account. Eleven out of 15 neurophysiological outcome measures (73%) showed significantly larger
variability among patients with aphasia, emphasizing the need to
control for heterogeneity and the potential risk of overestimating
results when not doing so. In a first experiment we investigated
possible effects of three different phonemic contrasts during

auditory phoneme discrimination and whether the request for an
active response played an additional role in this discrimination
process. In a second experiment we wanted to explore the process
of discriminating between real words and pseudowords and see to
what extent patients with aphasia differ from a norm group.
4.1. Auditory phoneme discrimination
The patients with aphasia revealed a larger MMN amplitude to
PoA compared to MoA and voicing in the pre-attentive condition.
However, the difference between PoA and MoA vanished during
attentive phoneme discrimination, preserving only the larger
P300 responses for the PoA phonemic contrast compared to voicing
when higher cognitive resources were required. These diverse
responses to the phonemic contrasts within patients with aphasia
can potentially be explained in light of the spectrotemporal differences each phonemic contrast represents and the potential effect
stroke has on these phonemic representations. The frequency separation representing PoA (/b/ - /g/) is larger than the spectrum representing voicing (/b/ - /p/) or MoA (/b/ - /m/). This is related to the
position of the articulators, as a frontal PoA such as /b/ and a back
PoA such as /g/ gives rise to a low or a high second formant, respectively (Rietveld & van Heuven, 2009). In general, in non-brain damaged individuals a broader frequency spectrum might lead to a
more salient contrast (Tampas, Harkrider, & Hedrick, 2005), engage
more active cortical neurons during the discrimination process and
lead to a greater ERP response (Diesch & Luce, 1997; Korczak &
Stapells, 2010). Thus, phonemes differing in PoA likely invoke a larger neuronal network related to the larger spectral differences
between respective phonemes (Aaltonen, Eerola, Lang,
Uusipaikka, & Tuomainen, 1994). With respect to the present
study, this is more or less confirmed by the results in the norm
group, where larger MMN and P300 amplitudes for PoA were
established compared to MoA and larger P300 amplitudes compared to voicing. Moreover, discrimination of phonemes differing
in PoA is also supported by an auditory-motor integration network, in which auditory features of a phoneme are integrated with
its articulatory features and is supported by a dorsal neuronal network, encompassing posterior temporal, inferior parietal and premotor and motor regions (Mottonen & Watkins, 2009;
Turkeltaub & Branch Coslett, 2010). Possibly, such an integrated
auditory-motor neuronal network provides additional support
when phonemic categorization is impaired due to stroke-related
physiological and neurological instabilities, potentially more for
PoA than voicing or MoA. Hence, the larger MMN and P300 amplitudes for PoA compared to the other phonemic contrasts in the

current group of patients with aphasia argues for some form of
hierarchical sensitivity for phonemic contrasts in aphasia.
The idea of specific phonemic contrast sensitivity during auditory discrimination in aphasia can to some extent be supported
by the comparison between the patients with aphasia and the
norm group. In the pre-attentive condition, patients with aphasia
only showed MMN amplitude reductions with voicing as phonemic
contrast, whereas in the attentive condition all three phonemic
contrasts revealed smaller P300 amplitudes compared to the norm
group. Considering the P300 potential reflects aspects of context
updating and attention allocation as a function of response selection (Polich, 2007; Verleger, Jaskowski, & Wascher, 2005), it can
be suggested that the already unsuccessful auditory discrimination
process in case of the phonemic contrast voicing has induced an
incorrect stimulus classification. Consequently, the patients potentially failed to properly allocate attention to the deviant stimulus
and as such failed to obtain a correct update of the neural representation of the stimulus environment (Polich, 2007). Another possibility is that, despite the successful auditory discrimination
process in case of the phonemic contrasts PoA and MoA, the
patients were not able to transform their correct decision on stimulus classification to a proper action, such as initiating a response
(Verleger et al., 2005). In other words, the patients were not capable of correctly monitoring the process from perceptual analysis
to response selection. This might explain why patients with aphasia reached a distinction between PoA and MoA in the
pre-attentive condition and not during the attentive condition.
The fact that the difference between PoA and voicing sustains with
higher cognitive load advocates for some form of hierarchy in
detection and further processing of the currently implemented
phonemic contrasts in patients with aphasia. Moreover, in both
the pre-attentive and attentive condition, patients with aphasia
showed the longest MMN and P300 latencies for voicing, with
the shortest P300 latencies for MoA in the attentive condition
and the shortest MMN latencies for PoA in the pre-attentive condition. Additionally, in the pre-attentive condition patients with
aphasia displayed longer MMN latencies compared to the norm
group with voicing and MoA, but not with PoA, whereas in the
attentive condition patients with aphasia showed longer P300
latencies with all three phonemic contrasts. These differences in
processing speed corroborate the idea of a potential hierarchical
pattern of impaired auditory discrimination of the presently used
phonemic contrasts. Tentatively, it can be suggested that for the
present study, PoA represents the largest separation in spectrotemporal properties, leading to a wider area of activation of cortical
neurons (Korczak & Stapells, 2010), and additionally relies on a
well-established auditory-motor integrated neuronal network
(Guenther, Ghosh, & Tourville, 2006; Pulvermuller et al., 2006;
Turkeltaub & Branch Coslett, 2010) as already outlined above.
Therefore, auditory discrimination of this phonemic contrast is less
sensitive for stroke-related neuronal damage. Conversely, auditory
discrimination of voicing embodies the smallest separation, which
is therefore the most vulnerable for stroke-related neuronal damage, and MoA is located in between.
Patients with aphasia clearly demonstrate a distinctive impairment of auditory discrimination influenced by three different
phonemic contrasts and a substantial effect of higher cognitive
load, i.e. increased attentional demands. PoA seems to be the most
salient phonemic contrast within patients with aphasia, indicated
by the higher response in both the pre-attentive and attentive condition and the need for higher cognitive load to elicit PoA amplitude reductions compared to the norm group. The outcome that
the phonemic contrast PoA is more resistant to brain damage has
been found before, in comparison with voicing which was characterized by a total lack or distorted MMN in patients with aphasia
(Csepe et al., 2001). However, for the first time to our knowledge

93

MoA was introduced as an extra phonemic contrast, differentiating
between an oral (/b/) and a nasal (/m/) phoneme. In this way, one
phonemic contrast of each distinctive feature in the Dutch language, namely PoA, voicing and MoA, could be performed in
patients with aphasia. The fact that the larger amplitude for PoA
compared to MoA during pre-attentive phoneme discrimination
disappeared in the attentive condition, illustrates an interaction
between both phonemic contrasts and therefore supports the
inclusion of MoA in the comparison of phonemic contrasts. It must
be noted though, that this study only covers one phonemic contrast per distinctive feature. It would be very interesting for future
research if other phonemic contrasts could be investigated (e.g. difference between /b/ and /d/ for PoA), in order to create a complete
inventory of neurophysiological correlates for different phonemic
contrasts.
In the pre-attentive condition, patients with aphasia showed a
more right lateralized scalp distribution of the MMN than the norm
group, but only when voicing was the phonemic contrast. This was
confirmed by more right lateralized MMN amplitudes for voicing
compared to PoA within the patients with aphasia, while the norm
group demonstrated a bilateral MMN amplitude distribution for all
phonemic contrasts. Apparently, less than two weeks after stroke
patients with aphasia show more right hemisphere activation during phoneme discrimination based on voicing, whereas this is not
the case for PoA and MoA. Right-hemispheric preponderance is
not detrimental per se, considering a study by Saur et al. (2006)
demonstrated that an elevation of right hemisphere activation
about two weeks after stroke can be related to better language performance. However, the present study could not associate the right
hemisphere preponderance during voicing-based phoneme discrimination to a specific behavioural improvement or deterioration, so no definitive conclusions can be made with respect to a
potential (dis)advantage of the current higher right hemisphere
involvement. The laterality-based differentiation between voicing
and PoA and MoA provides another argument for the presence of
a hierarchical sensitivity for phonemic contrasts in aphasia. The
difference in laterality patterns suggest different neurophysiological substrates for the different phonemic contrasts, at least for
voicing compared to the other two contrasts, and can be supported
by previous studies suggesting different ERP generator loci for different deviant types (Aaltonen et al., 1993; Ilvonen et al., 2003;
Ilvonen et al., 2004).
With the above outlined argumentation in mind, the active oddball task and the ensuing P300 potential do not seem an optimal
clinical, neurophysiological measure for auditory discrimination
of phonemic contrasts in the acute stage of aphasia. Large confounding effects of attention allocation and requirements for
higher cognitive load preclude a proper interpretation regarding
neuronal activation related to actual phoneme discrimination processes. Although it would provide valuable additional information,
it does not seem to fulfil the demands for application in the acute
stage of aphasia in light of seeking a valid and reliable clinical neurophysiological diagnostic tool for phoneme discrimination. The
poor behavioural results in the attentive condition, which barely
showed a 50% correct response rate and a very high standard deviation among the patients for all three phonemic contrasts, confirm
this conclusion and indicate that phoneme discrimination based on
all three phonemic contrasts was difficult for the patients with
aphasia. This is in contradiction with a study that indicated that
attentive syllable detection was rather easy for the aphasic subjects, who performed almost without errors (Becker & Reinvang,
2007b). The choice of stimuli definitely has an important influence
on this matter. In the present study, phonemes were used (/b/)
which differed only in one phonemic contrast, whereas the study
by Becker and Reinvang (2007b) used syllables ([ba] - [ta]) which
differed in more than one phonemic contrast. This enhances the

94

A. Aerts et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 84-96

difference and separation between standard and deviant stimulus
in the oddball task and potentially could have facilitated attentive
deviance detection. Moreover, differences in patient characteristics
such as severity of aphasia and time post-stroke between the present study and the study by Becker and Reinvang (2007b) could
also have influenced the phoneme discrimination process. This
implicates that the P300 potential might be utilized more reliably
in patients with mild aphasic symptoms and no or only mild concomitant cognitive disorders (e.g. decreased attention and
concentration).
4.2. Auditory lexical detection
From 100 ms onwards, higher N100 amplitudes to pseudowords were present in both patients with aphasia and the norm
group. This effect continued in the later time window of the P200
potential, around 200 ms, in both groups. However, the patients
with aphasia displayed a larger P200 amplitude compared to the
norm group in response to pseudowords. In the final N400 time
window, between 400 and 600 ms, pseudowords continued to elicit greater N400 amplitudes compared to real words in both
groups. These results correspond to the so-called ``pseudoword
effect'', which can be seen as a measure for single-word recognition
at the level of lexical access processes (Friedrich, Eulitz, & Lahiri,
2006; Giaquinto, Ranghi, & Butler, 2007; Karayanidis, Andrews,
Ward, & McConaghy, 1993; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Laszlo &
Federmeier, 2009; Van Petten & Rheinfelder, 1995). An N400 pseudoword effect can be explained in terms of an enhanced search
through the mental lexicon for a word's phonological form in case
of pseudowords, indicating the need for a greater cortical activation when a pseudoword is encountered and reflecting that a pseudoword is detected as such (Friedrich et al., 2006; Lau, Phillips, &
Poeppel, 2008). Our previous study demonstrated that the pseudoword effect already occurred 100 ms after stimulus presentation, continued through the P200 time window and eventually
ended in the N400 potential (Aerts et al., 2015), which is confirmed
by the current results. The finding that patients with aphasia display a higher sensitivity for pseudowords already 100 ms
post-stimulus, might suggest that they also (pre-attentively) perceive some form of irregularity in the phoneme sequence during
an initial phonological decoding phase (N100). Though, the
increased P200 amplitudes for pseudowords in the patients with
aphasia compared to the norm group might indicate either higher
susceptibility for task-irrelevant stimuli due to decreased inhibition or the need for more cognitive effort during form-based processes (Cooper, Todd, McGill, & Michie, 2006; Van Den Brink,
Brown, & Hagoort, 2001), such as the processing of several lexical
properties (e.g. phonological legality, phonotactic probability).
The greater N400 amplitude for pseudowords in the patients with
aphasia does suggest they perform an enhanced search through the
mental lexicon for a pseudoword's phonological representation
and recruits a wider cortical network to do so.
Despite the relatively intact sensitivity for pseudowords in the
patients with aphasia, implicating intact lexical access processing,
there was a significant delay throughout all time windows compared to the norm group, especially for processing of the pseudowords. Patients with aphasia revealed longer latencies
compared to the norm group in response to pseudowords for the
N100, P200 and N400 potential and in response to real words for
the P200 and N400 potential. In both groups, N400 latencies for
pseudowords were longer compared to N400 latencies for real
words. This is more or less comparable with studies which
employed the N400 to measure lexical-semantic integration deficits in patients with aphasia, at the sentence or word level
(D'Arcy et al., 2003; Hagoort, Brown, & Swaab, 1996; Kawohl
et al., 2010; Swaab, Brown, & Hagoort, 1997). A converging finding

of these studies was the presence of a close to normal N400 congruency effect in patients with good comprehension. By contrast,
patients with poor comprehension capacities either demonstrated
a significantly reduced N400 congruency effect, a significantly
delayed N400 congruency effect or even a complete absence of
such an N400 effect, compared to healthy controls. This led the
authors to conclude that such a distorted N400 congruency effect
probably indicates a lack of lexical-semantic integration capacities
in patients with aphasia. With respect to the present study, the
increased N400 amplitudes for pseudowords in a context of real
words throughout all time windows might suggest that lexical
access processing is not impaired in the current group of patients
with aphasia. However, because of the delayed processing of the
pseudowords throughout all time windows it cannot be stated
conclusively that processing at the word level is completely unaffected in aphasia. Taking into account the behavioural results of
the lexical decision task (PALPA 5), showing a minimum of 2 SD
below the normative mean score for all patients, the increased
latencies seem to have some adverse effect on the behavioural outcome. From a more neurophysiological point of view, the stroke
lesions most likely influenced the general conductive properties
of the brain tissue, leading to a less efficient information transfer
and therefore a delayed language processing.
In the P200 time window, patients with aphasia tended to have
a right-hemispheric lateralization in response to real words, in
contrast to the norm group who showed a more bilateral scalp distribution which is in line with expectations (Van Petten & Luka,
2006). It seems that the patients with aphasia in the acute stage
of stroke depend more on a right hemispheric involvement during
real word processing. Right hemisphere cooperation in the acute
stage of stroke is not unusual or detrimental per se, as it has been
demonstrated before that it can contribute to an improvement in
language performance within two weeks after stroke (Saur et al.,
2006). The occurrence of abnormal ERP patterns in specific time
windows, corresponding to different stages in language processing,
and a co-occurring favourable recovery in the post-acute stage has
been reported before (Angrilli, Elbert, Cusumano, Stegagno, &
Rockstroh, 2003; Laganaro, Morand, Schwitter, Zimmermann, &
Schnider, 2008). Considering that the current group of patients
with aphasia demonstrate an increased right-hemispheric lateralization of the P200 potential, it might be hypothesized that the
right hemisphere is only co-activated during form-based analysis
processes as a function of the detection of a real word. However,
considering the slower processing speed in the P200 time window,
it is possible that this right hemispheric cooperation might not be
entirely beneficial for real word processing at this point after
stroke.
4.3. Points of consideration
Two important aspects must be taken into account when giving
interpretation to possible (re)organisation ERP patterns in patients
with aphasia. Although the current statistical analysis accounts for
the large heterogeneity among patients with aphasia, it is not an
absolute measure, yet merely a way of controlling, at least in part,
for the variability among the patients. The large heterogeneity
among the patients with aphasia is associated with large differences in site of lesion (ranging from frontal to temporo-parietal
lesions) and type of lesion (hemorrhage, ischemia). Despite the
stringent control for heterogeneity among patients with aphasia
at the statistical level, it is still very likely that different lesions
at different sites with different causes lead to a variety of neurophysiological alterations (Leamy et al., 2014). Consequently, it is
possible that a compensatory activation pattern of one patient suppresses or interferes with a compensatory activation pattern of
another patient, creating overlapping effects. From a more

A. Aerts et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 84-96

methodological point of view, when using ERP measures one has to
be aware of phenomenon inherent to electrocortical properties
such as volume conduction. This means that right hemisphere electrodes can pick up electrocortical activity from left hemisphere
generators due to a rightward orientation of fissures and gyri and
conductance properties (Luck, 2005; Van Petten & Luka, 2006).
Keeping this in mind, interpretations with respect to reorganisational patterns in aphasia must be treated with caution and ideally
and definitely for clinical purposes, every patient should be treated
as an individual. A patient with aphasia can be compared with a
norm group or with itself over different time periods to monitor
potential therapeutic effects in order to get a better insight into
possible stroke-related reorganisation patterns. This approach is
currently pursued in an ongoing study.
5. Conclusion
The currently used paradigms, for which preliminary normative
data have already been developed (Aerts et al., 2013), have proven to
be sensitive enough to be used in the clinical evaluation of phoneme
and word processing in patients with aphasia in the acute stage of
stroke. The auditory phoneme discrimination task showed a differentiation between phonemic contrasts, in which PoA was the most
resistant to disruption and voicing together with MoA the most vulnerable, arguing for a hierarchical sensitivity for phonemic contrast
discrimination in patients with aphasia. In the context of implementing ERPs in clinical practice, the passive oddball task eliciting
the MMN is preferred over the attentively evoked P300 potential
because of additional confounding, cognitive factors. During
pre-attentive auditory lexical detection, patients with aphasia
demonstrated larger responses to pseudowords compared to real
words, yet with a delayed processing throughout all time windows
compared to the norm group. In future research, great effort must
be taken to obtain normative data for the patients with aphasia as
well, with respect to the different types of aphasia but also site, size
and cause of lesion. In this way, when using the current neurophysiological language tasks in the clinical evaluation of patients with
aphasia, they can be compared to a norm group of healthy subjects
of comparable age and gender and/or with patients having similar
semiology. These neurophysiological measures can provide an
important added value when patients with aphasia present with
either very subtle phonological input processing deficits, which
are difficult to grasp with the more regular behavioural language
tests (e.g. PALPA), or those patients incapable of undergoing extensive language testing, yet giving clinical impression of still comprehending language to some degree. Moreover, while results of
behavioural language tasks give us an idea about the end product
of the discrimination task, the neurophysiological measures provide
information about the neuronal process contributing to this behavioural end product. Hence, behavioural and neurophysiological
measures can complement each other.
Statement of significance to the neurobiology of language
Research on neurophysiological correlates of phonological input
processes in acute aphasia is scarce. We aim to enrich this field of
research and examine ERPs during phoneme discrimination and
lexical detection by differentiating between phonemic contrasts,
word type and attentional level. The results provide valuable information for potential clinical use of ERPs.
