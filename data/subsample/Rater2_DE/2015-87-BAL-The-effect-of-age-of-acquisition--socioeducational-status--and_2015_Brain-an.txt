This study investigates the role of age of acquisition (AoA), socioeducational status (SES), and second language (L2) proficiency on the neural processing of L2 speech sounds. In a task of pre-attentive listening
and passive viewing, Spanish-English bilinguals and a control group of English monolinguals listened to
English syllables while watching a film of natural scenery. Eight regions of interest were selected from
brain areas involved in speech perception and executive processes. The regions of interest were examined
in 2 separate two-way ANOVA (AoA  SES; AoA  L2 proficiency). The results showed that AoA was the
main variable affecting the neural response in L2 speech processing. Direct comparisons between AoA
groups of equivalent SES and proficiency level enhanced the intensity and magnitude of the results. These
results suggest that AoA, more than SES and proficiency level, determines which brain regions are
recruited for the processing of second language speech sounds.

1. Introduction
The goal of this fMRI study was to investigate the effect of L2
age of acquisition (AoA), socioeducational background (SES), and
L2 proficiency on the patterns of brain activity elicited by second
language speech syllables in a group of Spanish-English bilinguals
and a control group of English monolinguals. More precisely, this
study investigates how learning the phonology of a second language early or late in life, growing up in a family with a high or
low socioeducational status, and having a high or low proficiency
level in the second language impact the neural processing of second language speech sounds. Eight brain regions were selected
for analysis based on their involvement in speech perception and
executive processes in bilinguals.
Age of acquisition and proficiency in the second language are
two factors widely known to determine the ultimate attainment
of a second language (Cummins, 1979; Hernandez & Li, 2007). In
phonological learning specifically, early learners of a second language usually display more native-like patterns of L2 perception
than late learners but a high proficiency level in late learners is also
known to improve perception of second language sounds (ArchilaSuerte, Zevin, Bunta, & Hernandez, 2011). Socioeconomic status,
which tends to correlate with socioeducational background, has

recently emerged as a potential confounding variable in studies
conducted with bilingual populations because many bilingual
communities in the United States belong to minority groups of
lower social standing. Here we examine how these three factors
potentially influence neural processing of second language speech
sounds in the regions of interest selected.
Investigating the neural processes underlying speech perception
in bilinguals is a preliminary step toward understanding how bilingual perception impacts cognition. Much research has been dedicated to understanding the effects of bilingualism on cognition
and neural processing, especially in the realm of attention and inhibition (Bialystok, 2011; Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2008) but no studies
have investigated the effect of bilingual perceptual knowledge on
neural processing. That is, no studies have investigated how the perceptual mechanisms reshaped by the knowledge of two phonologies - where such L2 perceptual knowledge varies depending on
the individual's AoA and proficiency - impacts neural processing
of L2 sounds. Many studies have examined the effects of stimuli
(e.g., distance between L1 and L2 sounds, perceptual weighting of
acoustic cues) on perception (Best, McRoberts, & Goodell, 2001;
Best, McRoberts, & Sithole, 1988; Nittrouer, 1996), examined the
decline in perception for non-native speech sounds throughout
early childhood (Kuhl et al., 2008; Werker & Tees, 1984), and the
retention of perceptual sensitivity for non-native contrasts in bilinguals (Albareda-Castellot, Pons, & Sebastian-Galles, 2011; Bosch
& Sebastian-Galles, 2005; Sundara, Polka, & Genesee, 2006); but to
our knowledge, there have been no studies that take into account

participants' characteristics (AoA, SES, and proficiency) to investigate how these factors impinge on the neural processing of L2
sounds. One fMRI study conducted by Perani et al. (1998) took into
consideration AoA and proficiency to examine overall representation of the first and second language, but the study was not specific
to the domain of speech perception. A recent study by Kilman,
Zekveld, Hallgren, and Ronnberg (2014) examines the effect of language proficiency on speech perception in noise but it does not take
AoA or SES into consideration. It is important to understand the neural processes underlying speech perception in bilinguals because
future applied research can investigate how bilingual perception
impacts other linguistic skills and language development.
1.1. Early acquisition in L2 speech perception
Behaviorally, it is known that infants' ability to accurately perceive non-native speech declines rapidly in the first year of life
(Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens, & Lindblom, 1992; Werker &
Tees, 1983). However, even though these first few months are crucial to the development of native speech perception, infants continue to refine their perceptual abilities throughout childhood,
adolescence, and even young adulthood (Hazan & Barrett, 2000;
Sundara, Polka, & Molnar, 2008; Sundara et al., 2006; Walley &
Flege, 1999). For instance, bilingual infants who are continually
exposed to two languages can maintain the ability to differentiate
between L1 and L2 contrasts (Byers-Heinlein, Burns, & Werker,
2010; Sebastian-Galles & Bosch, 2009). This ability to differentiate
between L1 and L2 contrasts may be explained by children's acute
perception of within-category and between-category phonemes. It
has been found that early bilingual adults are able to ignore the
irrelevant acoustic differences that exist between exemplars of
the same phonemic L2 sound (e.g., hat-hat) and able to distinguish
the phonetically meaningful differences that exist between exemplars of different L2 sounds (e.g., hat-hot) (Archila-Suerte et al.,
2011). Even though the development of non-native speech perception in early bilinguals may not be linear (Bosch & SebastianGalles, 2005), monolinguals and early bilinguals share a similar
perceptual ability in the discrimination of speech sounds (Mayo,
Florentine, & Buus, 1997). In this study, monolinguals and early bilinguals are not expected to differ in the perception of English phonemes through the production of words outside the scanner that
match the syllables presented in the scanner because early bilinguals were exposed to the second language early in life and have
been exposed to a considerable amount of English throughout life.
In this study, we selected the bilateral superior temporal gyrus
(STG) as a region of interest because of its involvement in auditory
perception. Comprehensive studies have mainly identified the posterior STG (p-STG) as the primary region involved in the processing
of basic spectrotemporally complex sounds (i.e., speech) in comparison with complex nonspeech sounds, tones, noise, and silence
(Benson et al., 2001; Binder et al., 2000; Celsis et al., 1999;
Golestani & Zatorre, 2004; Vouloumanos, Kiehl, Werker, & Liddle,
2001; Zevin & McCandliss, 2005). Additionally, studies of skill
acquisition and expertise have shown that certain regions of the
brain are engaged according to the sensory phenomena associated
with the task. For example, if the task has a visual component such
as in reading, occipital lobe regions that process this type of sensory
input are recruited (Poldrack, Desmond, Glover, & Gabrieli, 1998).
On the other hand, if the task has a motor component, such as in
dancing, premotor regions are recruited (Calvo-Merino, Glaser,
Grezes, Passingham, & Haggard, 2005). It has also been found that
brain activations tend to be more intense in experts relative to novices; as in the case of face experts or athletes who respectively show
increased activity in the fusiform gyrus or motor areas of the brain
relative to novices (Gauthier, Tarr, Anderson, Skudlarski, & Gore,
1999; Wright, Bishop, Jackson, & Abernethy, 2010). Taking together

the neuroimaging findings in speech perception and sensory processing in skilled individuals, we expect monolinguals and early bilinguals - as speech perception experts of English sounds - to show
increased activity in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus relative to
late bilinguals of equivalent SES and L2 proficiency level.
1.2. Late acquisition in L2 speech perception
The speech learning process is thought to be different for individuals who learn the second language in adulthood. If the second language is learned late in life when L1 categories are established, L2
sounds that are highly similar to L1 sounds become assimilated by
pre-existing L1 categories whereas L2 sounds that are different from
any L1 phonemic category create new categories (Best & McRoberts,
2003). Even though late acquisition of a second language has been
traditionally associated with poor perception and production of L2
speech (Scovel, 1988), late acquisition does not necessarily impede
the ability to perceive non-native speech properly. Despite the difficulties that listeners may have acquiring the phonology of a second language in adulthood, accurate learning of non-native
speech can occur if there is abundant L2 input and the listener's
attentional resources are directed to L2 speech (Flege, 2003; Flege,
Bohn, & Jang, 1997). There tends to be ample variability in the perception of L2 sounds in late bilinguals (Marinova-Todd, Marshall, &
Snow, 2000). Improving the perception of L2 speech not only
requires heightened attention to the new speech sounds but also
practice with articulatory movements so the late learner has the
opportunity to try out tongue placement and precise motor timing
(Klein, Zatorre, Milner, Meyer, & Evans, 1994), just as articulatory
interventions are done with bilingual children displaying phonological errors (Holm, Dodd, & Ozanne, 1997). In the present study, late
bilinguals are expected to have more production errors than early
bilinguals and monolinguals in the behavioral task outside the scanner thus indirectly indicating that late bilinguals tend to have more
inaccuracies in the perception of L2 sounds.
The motor theory of speech perception proposes that perception depends on the procedural recoding of the sounds as articulatory movements (Liberman & Mattingly, 1985). Recent fMRI
studies have now demonstrated that the motor system is recruited
in tasks of speech perception (Wilson, Saygin, Sereno, & Iacoboni,
2004). More specifically, the rolandic operculum has surfaced as
an area heavily involved in articulation of speech sounds because
it contains part of the ventral portion of the somatotopic tongue
representation (Brown, Ngan, & Liotti, 2008; Brown et al., 2009).
The constant monitoring of what is being produced seems never
to be sufficiently fine-tuned in most late bilinguals (Simmonds,
Wise, & Leech, 2011). In order to see improvements in the longterm motor representations of articulation, late bilinguals must
remain aware of their tongue movements and vocalizations. This
internal awareness of L2 sounds and articulations may be an alternative way to learn the new speech sounds as there is no explicit
babbling stage in L2 for late learners. Based on the involvement
of the bilateral rolandic operculum in speech perception and production, we selected it as a region of interest to investigate brain
activity elicited by L2 speech sounds in monolinguals, early, and
late bilinguals. In particular, late bilinguals are expected to show
greater activity in the rolandic operculum bilaterally relative to
early bilinguals and monolinguals when listening to L2 speech syllables because of internal replay of the L2 sounds.
1.3. High language proficiency in L2 speech perception
As mentioned above, late bilinguals experience more difficulties
perceiving and producing the speech sounds of a second language.
However, it has been demonstrated that a high L2 proficiency level
predicts improved perception of between-category speech sounds

P. Archila-Suerte et al. / Brain & Language 141 (2015) 35-49

(Archila-Suerte et al., 2011). That is, highly proficient bilinguals can
learn to distinguish between two phonemes of different L2 categories (e.g., hat-hot), especially if the L2 sound is markedly different
from any L1 sound (Best et al., 2001; Fox, Flege, & Munro, 1995;
Iverson et al., 2003). This phenomenon observed in highly proficient bilinguals appears to result from increased attention to
speech (Archila-Suerte et al., 2011; Flege et al., 1997). Some types
of training paradigms, where attention is directed to the relevant
speech cues, can in fact facilitate non-native speech learning in
adults (Aliaga-Garcia & Mora, 2009; McCandliss, Fiez, Protopapas,
Conway, & McClelland, 2002; McClelland, Fiez, & McCandliss,
2002). Due to the inadvertent increased attention directed to
speech sounds, highly proficient bilinguals are expected to have
more accurate production of specific L2 speech sounds than low
proficient bilinguals.
An individual's ability to correctly perceive L2 sounds may be
predicted by neuroanatomical differences of the left insula/prefrontal cortex, left temporal lobe, and bilateral regions of the parietal lobe (Golestani, Molko, Dehaene, LeBihan, & Pallier, 2007;
Golestani et al., 2006). Several imaging studies of selective attention to speech have shown activity in the inferior parietal lobule
in response to listening to syllables or continuous speech
(Hugdahl et al., 2000; Pugh et al., 1996; Sabri et al., 2008; Von
Kriegstein, Eger, Kleinschmidt, & Giraud, 2003), although this
region has also been observed in older bilingual children
(8-10 yrs) passively listening to L2 syllables (Archila-Suerte, Zevin,
Ramos, & Hernandez, 2013). The inferior parietal lobule appears
to be involved in other domains of language, besides speech perception, that require attention. For example, studies with bilinguals report activity in the inferior parietal lobule in grammatical
and semantic tasks (Ding et al., 2003; Perani & Abutalebi, 2005;
Perani et al., 1998; Wartenburger et al., 2003). Taking together
the results from these studies, it appears that the involvement of
the inferior parietal lobule is essential in the neural processing of
speech sounds in bilinguals. Based on this literature, we have
selected the region of the inferior parietal lobule bilaterally to
examine brain activity evoked by L2 syllables. We expect highly
proficient bilinguals to show increased activity in this region relative to low proficient bilinguals because of heightened pre-attentive perceptual mechanisms involved in L2 speech processing.
Another region of interest selected for analysis was the bilateral
middle frontal gyrus. This region of the prefrontal cortex has been
associated with processes of executive function, including manipulation and short-term storage of information (Cohen et al.,
1997). Because of its involvement in working memory and its role
in fronto-lateral networks of attention (Vincent, Kahn, Snyder,
Raichle, & Buckner, 2008), studies with bilinguals report this to
be one of the regions involved in language switching (Luk, Green,
Abutalebi, & Grady, 2011; Wang, Xue, Chen, Xue, & Dong, 2007)
and inhibitory control (Bialystok et al., 2005). It has been reported
that activity in the middle frontal gyrus is stronger and more sustained in individuals with more efficient working memory processes relative to individuals with less efficient processes (Pessoa,
Gutierrez, Bandettini, & Ungerleider, 2002). However, the literature
regarding neural processing efficiency in cognitive tasks is unclear.
Several studies have also reported increased activity in frontal and
parietal areas in individuals who perform less proficiently in tasks
of orthography, lexico-semantic decisions, and sentence production (Golestani et al., 2006; Hernandez, Hofmann, & Kotz, 2007;
Hernandez & Meschyan, 2006; Xue, Dong, Jin, & Chen, 2004). These
studies suggest that increased activity represents increased mental
effort. Therefore, the literature in attention suggest that highly proficient bilinguals will show increased activity in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule and middle frontal gyrus relative to low
proficient bilinguals due to heightened and superior attentive processes. On the other hand, the literature in L2 proficiency suggest

37

that low proficient bilinguals will show increased activity in these
regions relative to highly proficient bilinguals but this time due to
mental exertion and controlled processing.
1.4. Low language proficiency in L2 speech perception
Low proficient bilinguals tend to intermix and overlap phoneme
exemplars from different categories by not correctly identifying
where the phonemic boundary lies (Archila-Suerte et al., 2011).
The literature points to phonological working memory as a key element in L2 learning success (Doughty et al., 2010) and it appears
that poor phonological working memory affects how L1 and L2
speech sounds are processed because difficulties with native
speech perception predict worse performance of non-native
speech (Diaz, Baus, Escera, Costa, & Sebastian-Galles, 2008). Behaviorally, low proficient bilinguals are expected to have more inaccurate production of specific English phonemes outside the scanner,
thereby indicating problems of L2 perception, than highly proficient bilinguals. Furthermore, given the studies in neural efficiency
aforementioned, low proficient bilinguals may show increased
activity in fronto-parietal regions due to labored and conscious
processing of speech sounds. If, on the other hand, high proficient
bilinguals show increased activity in fronto-parietal regions due to
heightened pre-attentive processes, then low proficient bilinguals
are not expected to show surviving areas of activation relative to
high proficient bilinguals in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule
and bilateral middle frontal gyrus.
1.5. Socioeducational differences
Although socioeconomic status has been found to impact the
development of the prefrontal cortex (Noble & Farah, 2013), with
monolingual children from higher SES typically showing increased
activity in frontal regions of the brain, we do not expect to see a main
effect of SES that supersedes the effect of AoA or proficiency. This
hypothesis is derived from the long-standing literature on AoA
and proficiency in second language acquisition which have repeatedly indicated the importance of these two factors for second language learning, including L2 speech sound learning (Flege, 1995;
Flege & Liu, 2001; Flege, Munro, & Mackay, 1995; Piske, MacKay, &
Flege, 2001). It has been reported that bilingualism can counteract
the negative effects of poverty (Engel de Abreu, Cruz-Santos,
Tourinho, Martin, & Bialystok, 2012). If the data presented here support these recent findings of bilingualism serving as a protective factor to combat the negative effects of economic and educational
disadvantage, then we should observe increased activity in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus of low SES bilinguals relative to low SES
monolinguals.
In this article we show the patterns of brain activity in monolinguals, early, and late bilinguals with equivalent levels of SES and
English language proficiency in response to listening to English
speech syllables. Bilinguals' ability to correctly perceive L2 phonemes is essential to learning speech which is in turn fundamental
to developing other higher-level linguistic skills. This is of great
importance in academic environments where language learning
difficulties related to listening and reading comprehension
observed in bilinguals may originate from their inability to perceive L2 speech properly.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
There were 82 participants in this study. Sixty-six (66) participants were Spanish-English bilinguals and 16 participants were

38

P. Archila-Suerte et al. / Brain & Language 141 (2015) 35-49

English monolinguals. Bilinguals were divided into two groups:
early bilinguals (AoA < 9 yrs) and late bilinguals (AoA > 10 yrs).
The early bilingual group was composed of 34 participants
(9 males, 25 females) and the late bilingual group was composed to
32 participants (15 males, 17 females). In the early bilingual group,
there were 23 participants born in the US and 11 participants born
outside the US. In the late bilingual group, there were 5 participants born in the US and 27 participants born outside the US. For
those born outside the country, the mean length of residency in
the US was 9 years (SD = 5.5). Sixty-nine (69) percent of bilinguals
were of Mexican descent. Several other Spanish-speaking countries
from South America were represented in the minority. There was
no systematic cultural difference within the group of bilinguals
that exerted a confounding effect on the perception of second language speech sounds.
The average age of second language acquisition in early bilinguals was 5.6 years of age. None of the early bilinguals were
exposed to English from birth. The earliest exposure to English in
the group of early bilinguals was 3 years of age. All late bilinguals
had been exposed to English an average of 9.32 years at the time of
testing. The mean age of early bilinguals was 22.9 years (SD = 5.04)
and the mean age of late bilinguals was 26.5 years (SD = 5.75). The
cutoff of 9 years of age was chosen to classify bilinguals as early or
late based on the literature of second language acquisition which
deems a second language to be more successfully acquired before
puberty (Newport, 1990).
All monolinguals (6 males, 10 females) were of Caucasian descent. All but two participants were born in the United States. The
two participants born outside the country moved to the US during
early childhood. The mean age of the monolingual group was
24.4 yrs (SD = 4.5). See Table 1 for a summary of these demographics. All participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971), did not report a history of
language or speech-related disorders, and consented to the criteria
stipulated in the protocol approved by the Human Subjects Committee at the University of Houston.
2.2. Stimuli
Recordings of natural speech of the English syllables saf (/saef/
as in hat), sof (/sAf/ as in hot), and suf (/sVf/ as in hut) were
obtained from an adult male monolingual English speaker in a
sound-attenuated room. One hundred and twenty tokens (40
tokens for each syllable type) were digitized at 44,100 Hz using a
Sony MZ-NH800 mini-disc recorder and a Sony ECM-CS10 stereo
microphone. Once recorded, Praat software (Boersma, 2001) was

used to normalize peak amplitude to ensure audibility of all stimuli. Each syllable was paired with another syllable to create a trial
for the fMRI task (e.g., saf-saf; saf-sof; saf-suf; sof-sof; sof-suf; sufsuf). The six combinations of paired syllables times the number of
tokens recorded per syllable resulted in participants listening to a
variety of stimuli throughout the task. The English voiceless fricatives /s/ and /f/, with the random acoustic noise that characterizes
them, were used to aid the recognition of the vowel within the syllable. The English vowels /ae/, /A/, and /V/ were chosen as the stimuli for this study because Spanish-English bilinguals tend to
overlap and assimilate these phonemic categories onto the Spanish
phoneme /a/ (e.g., casa) thereby making these sounds difficult for
Spanish-English bilinguals to discriminate (Flege et al., 1995).
See (Bradlow, 1995) for a detailed list of vowel formants across
the two languages or (Archila-Suerte et al., 2013) for the list of
durations and frequencies of the syllables used in the present
study.
2.3. Procedure
2.3.1. Behavioral assessment
In order to assess participants' global language proficiency in
English and Spanish, the tests of picture vocabulary, listening comprehension, and verbal analogies from the standardized Woodcock
Language Proficiency Battery - Revised (WLPB-R) were selected.
(Woodcock, 1991). Participants named pictures of objects for the
test of picture vocabulary, filled-in-the-blank incomplete sentences for listening comprehension, and provided the word that
properly established a relationship between items for the test of
verbal analogies (e.g., you cut with scissors and you write with
______). All tests gradually increased their level of difficulty. The
test of picture vocabulary measured participants' ability to produce
language and the test of listening comprehension along with verbal
analogies measured participants' ability to understand language.
The combined tests evaluated participants' overall linguistic competence. These same tests were selected from the Spanish version
of the Woodcock-Munoz Language Proficiency Battery (Woodcock
& Munoz-Sandoval, 1995) to assess bilingual participants' proficiency in Spanish. The items in each of the tests of the English
and Spanish versions were equated for length, frequency, and difficulty. None of the items were identical across languages.
2.3.2. Speech recordings
Participants read 144 English words that targeted the production of the same vowel sounds heard during the fMRI task (/ae/,
/A/, /V/); for example: gas, sad, lot, job, lunch, and cup. These words

were read outside the scanner. All recordings were obtained in Praat with an external tabletop microphone (Omnidirectional Condenser, MX391/0). The purpose of these recordings was to
inspect the perception of English syllables through the production
of the target phonemes. Even though the recordings indirectly
measured perception, the literature has demonstrated close mappings between perception and production of speech (Wilson &
Iacoboni, 2006; Wilson et al., 2004). After the recordings, four English monolingual judges assessed the intelligibility of the speech
samples by transcribing what they heard and rating the level of
foreign accent of each speaker using a 9-point scale (1 = No Foreign
Accent, 9 = Very Strong Foreign Accent).
2.4. Experimental task and fMRI design
The task implemented in this study included pre-attentive listening of English speech syllables along with passive viewing of
a muted non-captioned film that displayed natural scenery (i.e.,
Planet Earth). Participants listened to blocks of syllable pairs of
saf, sof, and suf through MRI-compatible headphones while the
film played throughout the entire duration of the scan. Planet
Earth was selected because it did not include verbal material,
which prevented potential interference with the language task
of pre-attentive listening. All participants reported not having
seen the film before the study. Participants were instructed to
focus their attention on the film while the sounds played in the
background.
A pre-attentive listening paradigm enabled us to examine basic
perceptual processes while directing attentional engagement to an
unrelated visual stimulus. Minimizing the use of executive processes like attention and working memory was important to prevent the use of higher-order cognitive strategies that could lead
to attending to extra-phonetic cues that may overestimate the performance of bilinguals (Best et al., 1988; Zevin & McCandliss,
2005). At the end of the scan, participants were asked to describe
some of the scenes observed in the film to verify alertness during
the task (e.g., what animals did you see? what were the animals
doing?). All participants were able to describe the images viewed,
thus confirming that they were awake and attending to the film
during the brain scan. No particular scenes from the film were
selected; instead, all participants watched the first half of the film.
The fMRI task had a block design that presented 5 trials of the
same condition in a row. Each trial consecutively presented two
English syllables (e.g., saf - saf) during a scanner silent interval
between brain volume acquisitions. During the silent interval the
scanner noise was reduced by delaying the initiation of the pulse
sequence with a Repetition Time (TR) delay. This prevented the
scanner noise from tainting the speech signal. To further ensure
the quality of data acquisition, participants were asked whether
they could hear the syllables clearly before starting the task. The
duration of each experimental trial was 1.42 s. This included
510 ms of syllable duration, 150 ms of padded silence at the beginning and at the end of each trial, and an inter-stimulus (ISI) duration of 100 ms. Appended to the experimental trial was the brain
image acquisition time (TA) of 1.58 s, for a total trial duration of
3 s. Since each experimental block contained 5 trials, each block
lasted 15 s. An additional 12-s block of scanner silence where no
auditory stimuli were presented served as baseline condition.
The baseline condition only contained the visual stimulus of the
muted film. Therefore, baseline and experimental blocks alternated
in the following way: film (baseline), speech syllables + film, film
(baseline). The speech sounds were presented in a single fMRI
run that lasted 27 min. Participants listened to multiple exemplars
of the syllable pairs in a sequence of blocks that followed the same
order (see Archila-Suerte et al., 2013 for a graphic depiction of the
fMRI design).

2.5. fMRI data acquisition
Brain imaging data were acquired with a 3T Siemens Trio scanner and a 12-channel radiofrequency head coil at the Human Neuroimaging Laboratory of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,
Texas. A Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE)
sequence was used to acquire 3D anatomical images with a
T1-weighted contrast. We used a TR of 1200 ms, an in-plane
resolution of 1 mm  1 mm, and a slice thickness of 1 mm with a
field of view (FoV) of 87.5% (matrix of 256  256). Anatomical
images were acquired in ascending sequential order in the axial
plane. An Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence was used to acquire
functional data. We used a TR of 3000 ms, a TR delay of 1420 ms for
the scanner silent interval, a 90 degree flip angle, and a voxel size
of 3.4  3.4  5 mm. Twenty-six slices per volume were acquired
in an interleaved descending order in the axial plane. To optimize
the timing synchronization between the task and the scanner, we
used in-house NEMO software (Network Experiment Management
Objects).
2.6. fMRI data analyses
Data were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping, SPM8
(Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London), using a block
design specification for our statistical model. The pre-processing
of the functional data included slice-timing and motion correction,
corregistration of anatomical to functional images, tissue segmentation, normalization of data into MNI stereotaxic space, and
smoothing of data to enhance signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). For
slice-timing correction, the median slice of the interleaved
descending acquisition was used as the reference slice. A rigid body
transformation minimized the errors introduced by head motion in
realignment. The motion parameters were then modeled as confounds at the first-level of analysis. Spatial smoothing used an
8 mm full-width half maximum Gaussian Kernel. The stimulus presentation onsets for each condition were modeled with a canonical
hemodynamic response function and a high-pass filter of 128 s.
Simple linear contrasts of all the conditions (speech syllable pairs
and baseline) were conducted at the first level of analysis in order
to enable complex between-group comparisons at the second level
of analysis. Since the results of the present study did not show any
differences in brain activity between paired syllables that were the
same (e.g., saf-saf) and paired syllables that were different (e.g.,
saf-sof) or vice versa, a global condition labeled all English syllables
that combined all speech syllable conditions was created. This global condition was contrasted with baseline at the first level and
then contrasted across groups of AoA, SES, and proficiency at the
second level. Including the variables of AoA, SES, and proficiency
in 2-way fMRI ANOVA analyses enabled the examination of main
effects and interactions. Moreover, it enabled detailed direct comparisons between AoA groups of equivalent SES or equivalent proficiency which other studies may not be able to examine due to the
small sample of participants recruited.
At the second level of analysis, two separate 2-way ANOVA's
were conducted on eight independent regions of interest (ROI)
which derived from four homologous areas in each hemisphere.
The ROI's were extracted using the SPM toolbox WFU_PickAtlas
(Maldjian, Laurienti, Kraft, & Burdette, 2003). Because of the
reduced brain area being examined in each ROI, type I error is
reduced and this allows more liberal intensity and cluster magnitude thresholds to be used (intensity peak a < 0.05, cluster size
k > 20). Unlike whole-brain analysis that require family-wise-error
(FWE) correction due to the voxel-by-voxel testing of the null
hypothesis, ROI analysis conducts an average of the time series
of all the voxels in the ROI thereby allowing contrasts with a probability of p < 0.05 to be considered statistically significant. The

40

P. Archila-Suerte et al. / Brain & Language 141 (2015) 35-49

eight ROI's extracted were the bilateral superior temporal gyrus,
bilateral rolandic operculum, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, and
bilateral inferior parietal lobule. These brain areas have been
reported in the literature to be important for speech perception
and executive function in bilinguals.
The first ANOVA examined the main effect of age of acquisition
and socioeconomic status (i.e., AoA  SES) and their interaction in
a whole-brain analysis (FWE-corrected p < 0.05). This grand analysis was followed up by in-depth analyses of each region aforementioned (unc. p < 0.05) to compare AoA groups (monolinguals, early
bilinguals, and late bilinguals) across levels of SES (low SES, high
SES). Similarly to the first ANOVA, the second ANOVA examined
the effect of age of acquisition and L2 proficiency (i.e., AoA  L2
proficiency) and their interaction in a whole-brain analysis (also
FWE-corrected, p < 0.05). This analysis was also followed up by
ROI analyses to compare AoA groups (early and late bilinguals) across
levels of proficiency. Monolinguals were excluded from this second
ANOVA examining AoA  L2 proficiency because the monolingual
group was highly proficient in English and could not be reliably split
into two separate proficiency groups. Moreover, comparing L1
proficiency in monolinguals vs. L2 proficiency in bilinguals raises
some theoretical concerns regarding the time allotted to become
proficient in English. More specifically, monolinguals have built
proficiency on the same language over the years whereas bilinguals
have split their time over the years to build proficiency on two
languages. This makes the comparison between L1 proficiency in
monolinguals and L2 proficiency in bilinguals imbalanced and
inadequate.

3. Results
3.1. Behavioral results
Monolinguals, early bilinguals, and late bilinguals had a comparable number of years of education completed F(2,79) = 1.64,
p = 0.20 and similar scholastic ability given their grade point average F(2,79) = 2.01, p = 0. 14. The groups significantly differed in
socioeducational status (SES) F(2,79) = 7.42, p < 0.001. In order to
account for these differences in the neuroimaging data, the first
ANOVA model examined the main effects of AoA and SES. More
importantly, in-depth comparisons between AoA groups equated
on SES were examined to reveal any potential confounding effects
of the latter. Participants were considered to be of low SES if the
maximum level of parental education attained was less or equal
than a high school degree and of high SES if the maximum level
of parental education was college or an advanced degree.
For second language proficiency (i.e., English), the three measures of picture vocabulary, listening comprehension, and verbal
analogies were strongly correlated (picture vocabulary and listening comprehension r = 0.536, p < 0.001; picture vocabulary and
analogies r = 0.547, p < 0.001; listening comprehension and analogies r = 0.532, p < 0.001, two-tailed); therefore, a composite score
was calculated to use one score as a global measure of English proficiency. The combination of strongly correlated measures into one
factor is statistically appropriate and a common approach
employed in factor analysis and structural equation modeling
(Bollen, 2005). Monolinguals obtained significantly higher scores
than early bilinguals and late bilinguals in English proficiency
(monolinguals vs. early bilinguals F(1,48) = 3.95, p < 0.05; monolinguals vs. late bilinguals F(1,46) = 10.69, p = 0.002). Yet, early bilinguals were significantly better than late bilinguals in English
proficiency F(1,64) = 4.46, p < 0.03. See Fig. 1, panel A. These differences in English proficiency between monolinguals and bilinguals
were expected given that monolinguals were tested in their native
language and bilinguals were tested in their second language. In

Spanish proficiency, late bilinguals were significantly more proficient than early bilinguals F(1,64) = 11.43, p < 0.001. This result
was also expected because late bilinguals were exclusively raised
in Spanish-speaking environments until late childhood. See Fig. 1,
panel B. Early and late bilinguals were classified as low proficient
in English if their individual composite score fell below the mean
of their corresponding group and as high proficient if their score
fell above the mean of their corresponding group. Proficiency classification took into consideration the group to which the individual
belonged (early or late) to adjust for timing in L2 age of acquisition.
For example, highly proficient late bilinguals may not be as proficient as early bilinguals but their scores are high relative to other
members of the same late bilingual group.
There were no significant differences between bilingual participants born in the US vs. bilingual participants born outside the US,
F(1,64) = 2.25, p = 0.13. Any potential difference between bilinguals
born in the US and bilinguals born outside the US is explained by
the variable of AoA because AoA and birthplace are significantly
correlated r = 0.52, p < 0.001. The variable of birthplace is tightly
linked to AoA because age of acquisition represents the age at which
the participant became immersed in the second language, which
coincides with the age US-born bilinguals began elementary school
(early bilinguals) or the age of arrival to the country (late bilinguals). Since the differences between bilinguals who were born in
the US and bilinguals who were born outside the US closely align
with the groupings of early and late, the results do not change if
the groupings are re-arranged as born-in-the-US vs. born-outside-the-US.
3.1.1. Speech recordings
Five participants who completed the fMRI task had a corrupted
speech recording or did not have a speech recording at all. Monolinguals, early, and late bilinguals did not differ in the production of
words containing the phonemes of /ae/, /A/, and /V/ F(2,74) = 2.06,
p < 0.13. That is, judges rated monolinguals, early bilinguals, and
late bilinguals to produce L2 words similarly. See Fig. 2. Therefore,
all bilingual participants had typical auditory and articulatory processes that allowed them to perceive and produce sounds in the L2
sufficiently accurately according to native listeners. All three
groups significantly differ in overall foreign accent F(2,74) = 23.37,
p < 0.001. In foreign accented English, early bilinguals were marginally different from monolinguals F(1,45) = 4.74, p < 0.035 and late
bilinguals were significantly different from early bilinguals
F(1,61) = 27.00, p < 0.001 and from monolinguals F(1,61) = 25.78,
p < 0.001. English proficiency in bilinguals was inversely correlated
with overall foreign accent r = 0.628, p < 0.001 indicating that
higher L2 proficiency is associated with better perception and production of non-native speech sounds. Subgrouping early and late
bilinguals as high proficient and low proficient also did not show
significant differences in the production of any of the target phonemes (/ae/: F(1,61) = 1.0, p = 0.31; for /A/: F(1,61) = 0.17, p = 0.67;
for /V/: F(1,61) = 0.06, p = 0.80).
Although mean parental socioeducational background differed
between monolinguals, early bilinguals, and late bilinguals
F(2,79) = 7.42, p < 0.001, socioeducational background did not have
an effect on how accurately English words were produced outside
the scanner as groups of low SES and high SES performed similarly
(/ae/: F(8,68) = 1.21, p = 0.302, /A/: F(8,68) = .598, p = .776, /V/: F(8,68) =
1.01, p = .432).

3.2.1. Whole-brain analysis in AoA  SES ANOVA
A whole-brain analysis, family-wise error (FWE) corrected
p < 0.05 with a magnitude threshold k = 20, showed no main effect
of AoA, or SES, or an interaction.

monolinguals nor early bilinguals showed increased activity in
the right or left rolandic operculum relative to late bilinguals.

10 60 to 36 56 0; left hemisphere ROI from 30 14 60 to 40 52
0). There was an interaction between AoA and SES in the right and
left middle frontal gyrus. As with the superior temporal gyrus, the
interactions were closely studied through specific comparisons
between AoA groups. Early bilinguals showed increased activity
in the right middle frontal gyrus relative to late bilinguals of equivalent high or low SES. Additionally, early bilinguals showed
increased activity in the right and left middle frontal gyrus relative
to monolinguals but only when the groups were of parallel low SES.

60 38 20 to 58 6 10; left hemisphere ROI from 58 38 20 to 50
2 10). There was an interaction between AoA and SES in the right
and left superior temporal gyrus. The interactions were examined
through discrete comparisons between AoA groups of equivalent
SES. Monolinguals showed increased activity in the left and right
superior temporal gyrus relative to early bilinguals of equivalently
low or high SES. Similarly, late bilinguals showed increased activity
in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus relative to early bilinguals
of equivalent SES. On the contrary, early bilinguals did not show
any increased activity in either hemisphere of the superior temporal gyrus relative to monolinguals or late bilinguals of the same
SES. See Table 2 for a detailed list of cluster sizes and peaks of activation by group comparison in each ROI examined in the

in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule of late bilinguals relative
to monolinguals and early bilinguals of equivalent low SES. Early
bilinguals also showed increased activity in the region bilaterally

suprathreshold activity. Effects of AoA in this second ANOVA
resembled the pattern of findings reported in the first ANOVA
(AoA  SES) examining the ROI of the bilateral superior temporal
gyrus; that is, late bilinguals showed increased activity in the superior temporal gyrus relative to early bilinguals of equivalent high
or low proficiency level. See Table 3 for a detailed list of group

4. Discussion
The present study investigated the effect of age of acquisition,
socioeducational status, and L2 proficiency on the neural processing of second language speech sounds. Results from the behavioral
data acquired outside the scanner revealed that even though monolinguals were significantly more proficient in English than early
and late bilinguals, the groups did not differ in their ability to produce English words that contained the same speech sounds
employed in the fMRI task. Bilinguals classified as high or low proficient in English did not differ in the production of L2 words either.
These results indicate that even though early and late bilinguals
did not have more extensive vocabularies or better comprehension
skills in English than monolinguals, both bilingual groups were
able to correctly articulate words in the second language.

Differences in oral and receptive L2 proficiency may be attributed
to differences in socioeducational backgrounds.
The behavioral findings of speech production outside the scanner partly support our hypotheses as monolinguals and early bilinguals in fact resembled each other in the production of English
sounds. Late bilinguals were unexpectedly similar to monolinguals
and early bilinguals in the production of L2 words, not showing
significant difficulties producing L2 speech. The hypothesis that
low proficient bilinguals would have more difficulties producing
L2 words than highly proficient bilinguals was not supported by
the results. While it is possible that the words employed in the production task did not sufficiently tax the cognitive system thereby

impeding the detection of potential perceptual differences
between monolinguals, early bilinguals, and late bilinguals; linking
the results of the production task outside the scanner and the perception task in the scanner by employing the same speech sounds
was important to interpret the results. Given that perception and
production are tightly interrelated (Flege et al., 1997), the behavioral results indicate that all bilingual participants were able to
accurately produce L2 words because the speech sounds (/ae/, /A/,
/V/) were properly perceived. That is, all bilinguals had a sufficiently accurate perception of English sounds. Despite comparable
perceptual abilities across monolinguals, early bilinguals, and late

Fig. 4. Region of interest analyses in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, the bilateral rolandic operculum, the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, and the bilateral inferior
parietal lobule in AoA  L2 proficiency ANOVA. Group comparisons in each ROI at the second level of analysis contrast the conditions of English syllables vs. baseline.
Comparisons show brain activity between groups of equivalent L2 proficiency level. Red: high L2 proficiency; Cyan: low L2 proficiency. Purple represents the main effect of
proficiency collapsed with the contrast of high proficiency vs. low proficiency which showed increased activity in virtually the same coordinates. ROI p-value < 0.05, cluster
size k < 20.

mechanisms underlying L2 speech processing differed depending
on participants' AoA - especially when equated for SES and L2 proficiency. Also in the behavioral analysis, parental socioeducational
differences between the groups did not affect how accurately English words were produced outside the scanner but taking SES into
consideration in the fMRI analyses helped increase the robustness

of the results by exposing areas of activation with larger clusters
and more intensity in the regions investigated.
Region of interest analyses in the left and right superior temporal gyrus, two regions respectively associated with speech perception processes (Binder et al., 2000; Liebenthal, Binder, Spitzer,
Possing, & Medler, 2005) and auditory processing of rhythm, stress,

P. Archila-Suerte et al. / Brain & Language 141 (2015) 35-49

and intonation (Geiser, Zaehle, Jancke, & Meyer, 2007), showed
that speech sounds elicited activity in different regions within
the STG given participants' AoA group and SES. Specific group comparisons showed that monolinguals and late bilinguals more intensely and extensively engaged the bilateral STG relative to early
bilinguals of equivalent SES, whereas early bilinguals did not
engage the left or right STG relative to monolinguals or late bilinguals of equivalent SES. That is, monolinguals and late bilinguals
who were of high or low SES showed more activity in the STG bilaterally relative to early bilinguals of equally high or low SES. This
pattern of results was also obtained when early and late bilingual
groups of similar proficiency levels were compared. Late bilinguals
with a high or low English proficiency level showed increased
activity in the STG bilaterally relative to early bilinguals with
equivalent proficiency levels. Therefore, the data consistently show
that monolinguals and late bilinguals more strongly engage the
bilateral STG than early bilinguals when listening to speech
sounds. These results suggest that learning one language early in
life as a monolingual (either one who continues to be monolingual
in adulthood or one who later becomes bilingual) strongly recruits
a brain region known to process perceptual auditory information,
whereas learning two languages in childhood does not recruit the
bilateral STG as intensely.
Contrary to our hypothesis which predicted that monolinguals
and early bilinguals would more strongly recruit the bilateral
STG relative to late bilinguals, the results indicate that when individuals become experts of one speech sound system in childhood,
the STG is recruited to process future new speech sounds. In a parasitic fashion, studies have found that the learning of grammatic
and lexico-semantic representations in a second language is supported by the same networks that enable these processes in the
first language (Abutalebi, 2008). This also appears to be the case
for speech sound learning that occurs after puberty as, in the present study, late bilinguals recruit the same cortical regions for processing L1 and L2 speech sounds.
Late bilinguals, irrespective of SES and proficiency, also showed
increased activity in the ROI of the bilateral rolandic operculum
relative to monolinguals and early bilinguals. In line with our
hypothesis, the recruitment of this region was exclusive to late bilinguals. Early bilinguals and monolinguals did not show activity in
the right or left rolandic operculum relative to late bilinguals.
Activity in the bilateral rolandic operculum, an area of the ventral
premotor cortex, has been reported in neuroimaging studies
employing speech perception and speech production tasks
(Szenkovits, Peelle, Norris, & Davis, 2012; Wilson et al., 2004).
For example, it has been found that listening to speech sounds
recruit the left and right rolandic operculum in typically-developing controls and stutterers (Biermann-Ruben, Salmelin, &
Schnitzler, 2005). Neuropsychological studies have additionally
shown that a lesion to the rolandic operculum impairs patients'
ability to internally repeat and maintain verbal information, thus
demonstrating the involvement of the rolandic operculum - particularly in the left hemisphere - in subvocal rehearsal (Henson,
Burgess, & Frith, 2000; Vallar, Di Betta, & Silveri, 1997). Behavioral
studies have noted that subvocal rehearsal mechanisms within the
phonological loop of working memory are important for first and
L2 acquisition (Baddeley, 2003; Brown, 1992). Since continuous
subvocal rehearsal is more important for the maintenance of unrelated items (Hashimoto & Sakai, 2002), late bilinguals may be
exceedingly recruiting this area to internally rehearse the speech
sounds of the L2 which likely remain less interconnected than
the sounds of the first language. The results observed in the bilateral rolandic operculum therefore suggest that late bilinguals,
regardless of their SES and proficiency level, recruit this pre-motor
area to support subvocal rehearsal of L2 sounds learned late in
development.

Region of interest analysis in the middle frontal gyrus, an area
of the pre-frontal cortex involved in working memory functions
including the manipulation and storage of short-term information
(Cohen et al., 1997), showed that speech sounds elicited activity in
different regions of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus depending on
participants' AoA group and SES. The in-depth examination of this
interaction showed that early bilinguals increased activity in the
right middle frontal gyrus relative to late bilinguals irrespective
of SES in response to listening to L2 speech sounds. That is, high
or low SES early bilinguals showed more activity relative to late
bilinguals of comparable high or low SES. Early bilinguals also
showed increased activity in the right middle frontal gyrus when
compared to late bilinguals of similar L2 proficiency levels. Therefore, early bilinguals - despite socioeducational or L2 proficiency
level - showed increased activity in the right middle frontal gyrus
relative to late bilinguals. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in the
middle frontal gyrus, shows peaks of activation in early bilinguals
relative to late bilinguals. This region has been reported in the literature of executive functions of task switching in bilinguals
(Hernandez, Dapretto, Mazziotta, & Bookheimer, 2001; Wang,
Kuhl, Chen, & Dong, 2009) who appear to have superior cognitive
control compared to monolinguals due to the environmental
demands imposed by managing two languages (Bialystok et al.,
2008). Linking previous findings to the results of the present study,
it appears that early bilinguals of high or low SES and high or low
L2 proficiency level who have extensive experience cognitively
maneuvering two languages from an early age strongly recruit prefrontal regions to manipulate speech sound information that is
typically processed by regions of the brain involved in auditory
perception i.e., STG. In other words, in contrast to the activity
evoked by speech sounds in the superior temporal gyrus which
monolinguals and late bilinguals more strongly recruit, early bilinguals recruit an area of higher-order executive function and cognitive control to process speech sound information that is
fundamentally sensorial. Early bilinguals have a unique linguistic
environment that requires the manipulation of speech sounds in
early childhood and this appears to trigger the engagement of prefrontal areas to process sound information that is usually processed by temporal brain regions dedicated to auditory perception.
Additionally, early bilinguals showed increased activity in the
bilateral middle frontal gyrus relative to monolinguals; however,
this activity was only observed when early bilinguals of low SES
were compared to monolinguals of equivalent low SES. It has
been documented in the literature of socioeconomic status and
executive function that individuals from higher SES backgrounds
have better attention control, working memory, and fluid processing than individuals from lower SES backgrounds (Lipina et al.,
2013). It is thought that the prefrontal cortex, which has a prolonged period of development, is more susceptible to the environmental factors to which children are exposed early in life (Noble
& Farah, 2013; Noble, McCandliss, & Farah, 2007). It has also been
reported that bilingualism in impoverished environments has a
positive effect on overall cognitive function, despite persistent
low verbal scores in low SES bilingual children (Carlson &
Meltzoff, 2008; Engel de Abreu et al., 2012). In the present study,
low SES early bilinguals showed increased activity in the middle
frontal gyrus relative to low SES monolinguals. These results
indicate that early bilinguals, despite a general socioeducational
disadvantage, more strongly recruit areas of executive function
which suggests that early bilingualism in the midst of socioeducational difficulties may improve individuals' abilities in higherorder cognition; thus corroborating our hypothesis and the
findings of Carlson and Meltzoff (2008) and Engel de Abreu
et al. (2012). Early bilinguals thus recruit executive regions of
the brain to process L2 speech sounds relative to monolinguals
and late bilinguals and the extended practice switching between

46

two sound systems may serve to counteract the negative effects
of low SES on cognition.
The inferior parietal lobule, an area widely reported in studies
with bilinguals (Garbin et al., 2011; Golestani et al., 2006; Wang
et al., 2009), is known to be part of the fronto-parietal attention
control network along with the lateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (Liu, Slotnick, Serences, & Yantis, 2003;
Vincent et al., 2008). The results show that late bilinguals more
strongly engage this area relative to early bilinguals and monolinguals of equivalent low SES. Early bilinguals also recruited the
inferior parietal lobule bilaterally relative to monolinguals of
comparable low SES. Therefore, low SES bilinguals, whether early
or late, show stronger activations of the inferior parietal lobule
relative to low SES monolinguals. However, only late bilinguals
who were either high or low proficient in the second language
showed increased activity in the left inferior parietal lobule relative to early bilinguals of equivalent proficiency levels. These
results suggest that, like in the middle frontal gyrus, bilingualism
may exert a positive effect in the attentional processes of bilinguals of low SES relative to monolinguals of low SES. Even though
regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortex compose the frontoparietal network, the middle frontal gyrus has been primarily
associated with working memory processes that include on-line
handling of information (Cohen et al., 1997) and the inferior parietal lobule has been mainly associated with selective attention
(Behrmann, Geng, & Shomstein, 2004; Posner, Walker, Friedrich,
& Rafal, 1984). Since activity in posterior areas of the brain (i.e.,
inferior parietal lobule) is observed in late bilinguals of either
high or low proficiency levels and activity in anterior regions of
the brain (i.e., prefrontal cortex/MFG) is observed in early bilinguals of either SES and proficiency levels, it appears that there is a
difference in how early and late bilinguals use the attentional
network for processing L2 speech sounds. Early bilinguals appear
to be engaging working memory processes, whereas late bilinguals appear to be relying more on selective attention. Theoretically, selective attention is thought to be a filter that minimizes
environmental stimuli for the proper focus of attention on the
item(s) of interest (Pugh et al., 1996) while working memory is
thought to retain relevant information from the environment
for further processing (Koelsch et al., 2009). While selective attention and working memory are not completely independent phenomena, it is possible that late bilinguals reduce the demands
of the linguistic environment by selectively attending to the
sounds of the second language, whereas early bilinguals absorb
all linguistic input from both languages to then manage, monitor,
and choose which language to continue processing. Selective
attention may be a more efficient approach for late bilinguals to
lessen the phonological intrusions of the first language, whereas
manipulating phonological information in working memory may
be more efficient approach for early bilinguals to juggle two
languages.
Effects of proficiency, contrary to what was hypothesized,
were not observed in the ROI's of the inferior parietal lobule
and middle frontal gyrus. While working memory and attention
processes were respectively observed in early and late bilinguals,
activity in these regions was independent of proficiency level.
That is, the results presented here do not support the view that
successful processing of speech sounds in highly proficient bilinguals increases activity in fronto-parietal regions or that low proficient bilinguals increase activity in these regions due to
mental effort. Instead, the results of this study are in line with
Wartenburger et al. (2003) who showed that the effect of AoA
may play a stronger role than proficiency in other aspects of second language learning. An effect of high proficiency relative to
low proficiency was observed in the bilateral STG and right rolandic operculum, indicating that highly proficient bilinguals more

strongly recruit regions involved in L2 speech perception and
subvocal rehearsal. Behavioral studies have found that high proficient bilinguals have improved perception of phonemes that
belong to different categories (Archila-Suerte et al., 2011) and
the present fMRI results suggest that this improved perception
is the result of focused and intense activity in perceptual and
articulatory areas. As observed in the results and in support of
the hypothesis, there were no main effects of SES in any of the
ROI's investigated. However, controlling for SES through direct
comparisons between AoA groups made the fMRI results more
robust which suggests that SES should be taken into consideration in future bilingual studies.
Taking the behavioral and fMRI findings together, the data suggest that even though early and late bilinguals are similar in their
behavioral perception and production of L2 speech sounds, the
neural underpinnings of second language speech perception primarily differ depending on the bilingual's AoA, especially when
the groups compared are of equivalent SES and L2 proficiency level.
4.1. Limitations
Future studies should use more complex stimuli for bilinguals
to perceive given that simple stimuli may result in a floor effect
that does not allow potential differences between AoA groups to
be detected. Future studies could also include independent blocks
of visual stimuli, auditory stimuli, a baseline block of silence without visual stimuli, and a mixed block of visual and auditory stimuli.
The dissociation of the visual and auditory tasks in some of the
blocks could help answer questions of involuntary perceptual control in bilinguals.
5. Conclusion
Despite similarities in the ability to produce English words
between monolinguals, early, and late bilinguals outside the
scanner; age of acquisition showed the strongest effect on the
neural processing of L2 speech sounds in all the regions of interest examined, especially when the groups were of equivalent
socioeducational status and L2 proficiency. High proficiency
showed some effects in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus
and rolandic operculum. In summary, monolinguals and late bilinguals of comparable SES and proficiency levels showed
increased activity in the superior temporal gyrus bilaterally relative to early bilinguals, whereas early bilinguals showed
increased activity in the right middle frontal gyrus relative to
late bilinguals of equivalent SES and L2 proficiency level. Early
bilinguals also showed increased activity in the middle frontal
gyrus bilaterally relative to monolinguals of equivalent low SES.
Additionally, late bilinguals - irrespective of SES or proficiency
- showed increased activity in the bilateral rolandic operculum,
while low SES bilinguals (both early or late) showed activity in
the inferior parietal lobule. Late bilinguals of both proficiency
levels (low and high) also showed increased activity in the left
inferior parietal lobule. The results suggest that early acquisition
of one language recruits expected temporal regions involved in
perceptual processing, whereas early acquisition of two languages
increases the engagement of prefrontal regions involved in working memory to process L2 speech sounds. Furthermore, the
results suggest that bilingualism can serve to counteract the
negative effects of low socioeducational environments on cognition and that late bilinguals may be using more selective attention (posterior areas) than early bilinguals to process L2 speech
sounds. Therefore, AoA appears to play an important role in L2
speech processing that is tied to SES and proficiency level in
the second language.

Statement of significance
No studies have investigated the role of multiple within-subject
variables on the neural processing of L2 speech sounds. Investigating the neural processes underlying L2 speech perception is a preliminary step that will help generate future research to understand
how bilingual perception affects other linguistic skills.
