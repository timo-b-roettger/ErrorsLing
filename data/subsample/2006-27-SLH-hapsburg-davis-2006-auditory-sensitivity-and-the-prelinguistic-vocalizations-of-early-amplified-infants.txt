Purpose: Vocalization development has not been studied thoroughly in infants
with early-identified hearing loss who receive hearing aids in the 1st year of life.
This study sought to evaluate the relationship between auditory sensitivity and
prelinguistic vocalization patterns in infants during the babbling stage.
Method: Spontaneous vocalizations of 15 early-identified infants with varying
degrees of hearing sensitivity, from normal to profound hearing loss, were
audiotaped and perceptually transcribed. Associations between the infant's unaided
pure-tone average and the following vocalizations were explored: canonical
babbling ratio, percentage of utterances containing canonical syllables, canonical
syllable shapes, number of syllable sequences, and consonant-onset patterns in
canonical syllables.
Results: Hearing sensitivity was significantly associated with the percentage of
utterances containing canonical syllables, the vocalization types used in utterances,
and canonical syllable shapes used by the infants.
Conclusions: Auditory sensitivity contributes significantly to the emergence of
babbling patterns. In addition, there is a need for continued study of the vocalizations
of infants with milder forms of hearing loss, because in this study, their vocalizations
were highly variable despite having received early amplification.

ocalization emergence during the canonical babbling period
results from a complex process involving coordination of multiple
subsystems. In particular, neurophysiologic-motor, tactile, proprioceptive, and perceptual factors have been noted as contributing to
vocal patterns (Eilers & Oller, 1994; Goffman, Ertmer, & Erdle, 2002;
Oller & Eilers, 1988; Stoel-Gammon & Otomo, 1986). Each of these
subsystems varies in the extent to which it contributes to the observable
properties of vocalization development. Complex systems, such as the
production system, are often not easily studied, because parts of the
system cannot be isolated from one another. Contributions of auditory
sensitivity to the emergence and organization of vocal patterns during the
canonical babbling period have not been thoroughly detailed in very
young infants who have been identified with hearing loss in the first year
of life. To describe fully typical production, it is important to identify how
the emergent properties of vocalizations in canonical babbling may
be influenced by auditory sensitivity. Studies of vocalization patterns
in infants with varying degrees of hearing loss can provide important
information about the relative contribution of production and perception factors to prelinguistic vocalization development. In addition, this

information can support the development of outcome
measures for infants with hearing loss who are receiving
amplification early in the first year.
The process of early speech acquisition from the
onset of canonical babbling has been widely described
for hearing infants through perceptual-transcription studies (Boysson-Bardies & Vihman, 1991; Roug, Landberg,
& Lundberg, 1989; Vihman, Ferguson, & Elbert, 1986).
Canonical babbling begins at approximately 6-8 months
of age (see Oller, 2000, for a review) and is characterized
by the production of repetitive, syllable-like output (i.e.,
[baba] or [daedae]). Perceptually, one of the most striking characteristics of canonical babbling is its sudden
onset and rhythmicity as it sounds strikingly speechlike. Oller (1986) noted the following perceptual properties of canonical babbling: (a) at least one fully resonant
nucleus (i.e., vowel with an identifiable quality, excluding highly nasalized vowels), (b) one nonglottal margin
(consonant other than glottal consonant), (c) duration of
syllable and formant transitions that are perceptually
consistent with mature syllable production, and (d) normal phonation and pitch range.
Babbling behaviors have been described in a
number of ways. Oller and Eilers (1988) used the canonical babbling ratio (CBR)--the number of canonical
syllables per total number of utterances in a sample--to
describe when the infant had entered into the "canonical babbling stage." A CBR of 0.2 or greater indicates
that the infant is effectively in the babbling stage. In
addition, other aspects of canonical syllables have been
explored. For example, Kent and Bauer (1985) studied
the most frequent syllable shapes and vocalization types
used by infants during this period. Syllable shapes describe the combination of consonants (C) and vowels (V)
that make up the syllable. For example, a syllable that is
made of a consonant followed by a vowel is described as
having a CV shape. Similarly, a syllable that is made up
of a consonant-vowel-consonant sequence is referred
to as having a CVC shape. Kent and Bauer found that
the CV shape was predominate over VCV, VC, and CVC
shapes and that, during this period, infants still used
an abundance of singleton vowels (SVs). In addition,
Mitchell and Kent (1990) studied the sequential structure of utterances produced by infants and found that
monosyllabic CV vocalizations accounted for 19% of the
canonical syllable types, whereas multisyllabic utterances only accounted for 11% of infant utterances. Within
CV syllables, the consonants used at the onset of CV
canonical syllables have been studied as well. Davis
and MacNeilage (1995) found that during the babbling
period, infants showed a predominance of coronal onsets
over labial onsets, but during the first-word period,
infants showed a reversed pattern. Segmental inventories have also been detailed for this vocalization period

(Boysson-Bardies & Vihman, 1991; Davis & MacNeilage,
1995; Roug et al., 1989; Vihman et al., 1986). The most
frequently observed consonant phone qualities were oral
stops (e.g., labial and coronal stops), followed by nasals
(e.g., /m /, /n / ) and glides.
Researchers (Davis & MacNeilage, 1995; Green,
Moore, & Reilly, 2002) have suggested that the primary
determinants of early babbling patterns in speech acquisition are motor-system factors. Studies of the underlying neurophysiological development of motor control
during this period have shown that the mandible develops before other articulators and achieves maturity or
adult-like characteristics between 1 and 2 years of age,
prior to any other articulator, including the upper lip and
lower lip (Green et al., 2002). Transcription-based studies
(Davis & MacNeilage, 1995) of the emergence of syllable
organization in infant babbling have also supported the
proposal that canonical babbling patterns are motivated
primarily by mandibular oscillations without independent movements of other articulators within syllables. Thus, the mandible provides a relatively mature
and stable structure that infants use to develop syllablelike behaviors at the onset of canonical babbling. Crosslinguistic studies of infant babbling have also suggested
that the primary system contributing to early speech
patterns is the motor system and that perceptual factors
contribute to a lesser extent. Prior to 10 months of age
and regardless of ambient language, infants tend to produce consonant qualities, including (a) labial and coronal
place and (b) stop (oral and nasal) and glide manner of
articulation (Boysson-Bardies & Vihman, 1991; Davis &
MacNeilage, 1995; Roug et al., 1989; Vihman et al., 1986).
At some point after 10 months of age, perceptual influences from the ambient language are reflected in infants'
production patterns (e.g., Boysson-Bardies & Vihman,
1991). This lack of apparent ambient language influence
before the late babbling and early speech periods suggests
that hearing infant vocalizations are initially more influenced by the production system (motor constraints)
than by perceptual input (Davis & MacNeilage, 2000).
The role of auditory feedback in the acquisition and
maintenance of speech vocalizations has been studied in
adults and children. Respiratory and kinematic studies of the effects of hearing loss on speech patterns in
older children and adults with hearing loss have shown
that reduced auditory feedback contributes to disordered
segmental and prosodic patterns after speech has been
acquired. Speech of older children with profound hearing loss has been shown to exhibit aberrant breathing
patterns, inappropriate levels of nasality, and poor timing of syllable sequences (Higgins, Carney, McCleary,
& Rogers, 1996; Tye-Murray, 1991). Even short-term interruptions in auditory feedback appear to result in alternate patterns of vowel production (Svirsky & Tobey,

1991). However, these studies on older children and adults
do not demonstrate the contribution of auditory sensitivity
during the earliest periods of speech acquisition.
In addition, landmark infant vocalization studies of
the 1980s and early 1990s unequivocally demonstrated
that early-vocalization emergence is subject to the influence of hearing sensitivity (Eilers & Oller, 1994; Oller
& Eilers, 1988; Stoel-Gammon, 1988; Stoel-Gammon &
Otomo, 1986). Canonical babbling is often delayed in infants with hearing loss compared with hearing infants
(Eilers & Oller, 1994; Oller & Eilers, 1988). Hearing
infants produce more monosyllabic sequences than diand polysyllabic sequences and show preferences for
CV and CVC syllable shapes during the canonical babbling period (Davis & MacNeilage, 1995; Kent & Bauer,
1985). However, no empirical studies have explored the
use of syllable shape, percentage of canonical syllables
in an utterance, and consonant onset in canonical CV
syllables in early-identified infants with hearing loss.
McCaffrey, Davis, MacNeilage, and von Hapsburg (2000)
phonetically transcribed segmental and syllabic patterns
in 1 profoundly hearing-impaired child who received a
cochlear implant at 24 months. Prior to implantation, the
infant produced predominantly SVs (mostly central) and
consonants (mostly prolonged labial-nasal qualities). She
had few CV syllable shapes, and had very few disyllabic
vocalizations. At 6 months postimplantation, her repertoire still included SVs but also showed an increase
in the number of CV syllables, suggesting a codependence
of hearing- and production-system factors in canonical
syllable emergence.
The codependence of production system and perceptual influences on vocalization organization was also
highlighted by Goffman et al. (2002), who studied effects
of change in auditory experience on motor control in 1
child, prior to and after she received a cochlear implant,
using movement kinematics. Before implantation, the
infant's movement variability was low, suggesting that
her movement diversification was limited. After gaining
experience with an implant, the infant's movement variability increased, allowing the her to explore a number
of possible speech-related movements. These findings
suggest that auditory sensitivity may contribute to movement patterning and that changes in auditory sensitivity
are potentially associated with measurable diversification in the production system. These studies highlight
the importance of early auditory feedback to the speechacquisition process and suggest that multiple subsystems
are recruited for the assembly of speech-like vocalizations.
Precise data on the level of auditory sensitivity required
for instantiation of prelinguistic speech-like syllable patterns are not available in children who have received hearing aids in the first 6 months of life. Few studies of vocal
development in infants with hearing loss have detailed
the effect of hearing loss on the emergence of various

aspects of canonical syllable patterns, specifically in infants
with milder hearing loss. Studies have mainly focused on
age of babbling onset, CBR (Eilers & Oller, 1994; Oller &
Eilers, 1988), and segmental inventories regardless of
syllabic context (e.g., Stoel-Gammon & Otomo, 1986).
In the present study, we evaluated the relationship
between auditory sensitivity and vocalization patterns
in infants with 6 to 12 months of early hearing-aid experience. The contribution of auditory sensitivity to the
organization of utterances and canonical syllable patterns was examined in 15 infants with hearing sensitivity ranging from normal sensitivity to profound hearing
loss. Associations between hearing sensitivity, as estimated by the unaided pure-tone average (PTA; the average of thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz), and
vocalization patterns traditionally studied in typically
developing infants were explored. We predicted that PTA
would be significantly associated with the vocalization
patterns observed, suggesting that interactive sensoryand production-system variables contribute to the vocalizations observed in the earliest phases of vocalization
emergence. We evaluated this prediction for each of the
following vocalization patterns: (a) CBR and percentage
of utterances containing canonical syllables, (b) vocalization types within utterance strings (i.e., singletons
[vowel- or consonant-like qualities]), glottal syllables (GSs;
those with glottal margins), and canonical syllables (those
with nonglottal margins), (c) syllable shapes (CV, VC,
CVC, VCV), (d) number of consecutive canonical syllable
sequences in an utterance (mono-, di- or polysyllabic),
(e) consonant onset within canonical syllables of CV shape,
and (f) consonant place in canonical syllables. These measures were chosen primarily because they have been extensively studied in typically developing infants and offer
a concrete method by which vocalization development
in infants with hearing loss can be effectively compared.
It is likely that these variables are not independent of one
another. For example, the measure of consonant segments at the onset of CV canonical syllables and consonant segments appearing in any context is related, as the
broader analysis of consonant segments appearing in any
context includes those segments in CV shapes. Although
there may be some degree of redundancy among these
particular variables, they have not been examined in one
set of infants, and, therefore, the overriding importance
of one variable over another is not clear.

screening at 25 dB HL. Six infants had bilateral mildto-moderately-severe sensorineural hearing loss. Five
infants had bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural
hearing loss. Table 1 describes participant demographic
characteristics. For purposes of description, the infants
are grouped according to the PTA in the better-hearing
ear as follows: normal (PTA = 25 dB HL), mild-tomoderately-severe (PTA = 26-70 dB HL), and severe-toprofound (PTA > 71 dB HL).
Infants with normal hearing. Data from 4 (male = 2,
female = 2) infants with normal hearing who participated in a larger study of early speech acquisition reported by Davis and MacNeilage (1995) were used for
comparison with the hearing-impaired groups (for more
details on these infants, see Davis & MacNeilage, 1995).
The average age of the hearing infants was 12.3 months
(range = 11-14 months). This age range was chosen because it matched the average age of the infants with
hearing loss and because it was the oldest age at which
the hearing infants were still producing a predominance
of canonical babbling. Only prelinguistic vocalizations
were analyzed, although 2 infants (R. and N.) were

812

entering the first-word stage, on the basis of parent
report of spontaneous word use. Tokens believed to be
words were omitted from analysis. All infants in this
group passed a soundfield hearing screening at 25 dB
HL for the frequencies 500-4000 Hz. These infants
were followed longitudinally over a 3-year period and
developed speech and language normally.
Infants with hearing loss. Data were collected for 11
(female = 4, male = 7) infants with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The 6 infants with bilateral mild-tomoderately-severe sensorineural hearing loss (M PTA =
47 dB HL in the better-hearing ear) were all boys. Table 2
shows the PTAs obtained for each ear for each participant. Because the infants were referred from multiple
centers, there were varying amounts of audiological information available in each infant's record. Audiometric
threshold information also varied, with some having only
soundfield information at select frequencies and others
yielding binaural, ear-specific data at many of the audiometric frequencies. Infant A.M. had missing information at 2-kHz bilaterally; therefore, a two-frequency PTA
(500 Hz and 1000 Hz) was used to calculate his PTA. The
average age at which the infants received their first hearing aids was 4.9 months. Average chronological age at the
onset of the study was 12 months (range = 7-15 months).
The average hearing age (i.e., time since hearing-aid fitting) was 7.1 months (range = 4.5-10.8 months).
Five infants with bilateral, severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (M PTA = 106 dB HL in the
better ear) participated (see Table 2 for auditory
threshold information). Infants with severe-to-profound
loss were, on average, 5 months older than those with
mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss or those with normal hearing. In addition, the hearing age of the infants
with severe-to-profound hearing loss exceeded that of the
infants with mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss by
approximately 5 months but approximated that of the
infants with normal hearing. For some of the infants in
the severe-to-profound group, no response was obtained at
the limit of the audiometer, at some frequencies. Table 2
shows these as "no response" ("NR [120 dB HL]"), for
Infants S.P., B.B., and L.B. The average chronological
age of infants with severe-to-profound hearing loss was
17.6 months (range = 13-24 months), and their average
hearing age was 13.3 months (range = 11-15 months).
The average age at which they received amplification was
approximately 4.3 months (range = 1.5-13.0 months).
Infants were referred to this study from three cities
in the southern United States. All participants had hearing parents who used oral communication. All except for
1 infant (G.W.) were from English-speaking homes. Infant G.W. was from a bilingual Spanish-English-speaking
home. None of the infants demonstrated severe motor or
cognitive delays, although some showed mild motor delays on the basis of available testing.

All of the infants with hearing loss were attending
oral-aural habilitation sessions at least once a week. A
description of the severity of hearing loss for each infant
was obtained from case histories and medical-audiological
records provided by parents. Click and tone-burst auditory brainstem response audiometry was used for
initial diagnosis and confirmation of hearing loss. All
participants had hearing and hearing-aid evaluations
performed by the audiologist at their local clinic within a
month of data collection. Behavioral pure-tone information was obtained either in the soundfield or through
headphones by the referring clinics. With the exception
of 1 infant, all hearing aids were fit using probe microphone procedures (real-ear-to-coupler difference [RECD])
and the desired-sensation-level (DSL; Cornelisse, Seewald,
& Jamieson, 1995) procedure. All participants wore behindthe-ear (BTE) hearing aids binaurally. Parents and the
investigator monitored hearing-aid function (i.e., made
sure the hearing-aid batteries were working, listened to
the hearing aids, and monitored hearing use) immediately
prior to data collection. Prior to data collection, hearingaid batteries were tested and a listening check of the hearing aids was performed to determine function.

PTA estimated from thresholds at 500 and 1000 Hz.

Data Collection Procedures
Recording. All infants were video- and audiorecorded and wore a wireless microphone (Audio Technica
ATW-1030 or a Telex ProStar FM remote microphone)
clipped to one shoulder of a bib specially made to hold
the wireless receiver. All data except for 1 infant were
recorded on digital audio recorders (Sony TCM-5000 or
Tascam DA-P1). After the microphone and receiver were
in place, infants were not typically aware of their presence. The investigator observed the infant and parent
interact in their home, monitored the equipment, and interacted with the infant only as needed for equipment
adjustments. The data for the hearing-impaired infants
were collected by the first author, with the exception of
3 infants (B.B., M.B., and L.B.) whose data were collected
by another aural habilitation specialist.
The amount of data collected for each infant varied
according to parent availability and vocalization volubility. Data were collected at home or during aural habilitation sessions conducted in center-based environments.
Data collection did not exceed a period of 1 month per
child. A total of 869 (M = 145) min of data was analyzed

for the group of infants with mild-to-moderately-severe
hearing loss. For the group of infants with severe-toprofound hearing loss, 821 (M = 164) min were analyzed.
The data for infants with hearing loss were compared
with a total of 360 (M = 90) min obtained from hearing
infants. Table 3 shows the number of minutes, utterances, CBR, and the percentage of utterances that contained at least one canonical syllable for each infant. All
infants except for 1 were in the canonical babbling stage
according to the criterion (0.2) described by Oller and
Eilers (1988).
Transcription. Data were transcribed using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA; International Phonetic Association, 1999) system of notation. The primary
investigator transcribed all data collected for infants with
hearing loss with the exception of 1 infant. All tokens
were digitized and played back through Sony MVR-V500
headphones. Video was used only to corroborate unclear
tokens on the audio recordings or to verify lip rounding when there was uncertainty. Tapes for the infants with
normal hearing from Davis and MacNeilage's (1995)
research were retranscribed to add nonsyllabic tokens

814

(singletons and GSs as well as untranscribable vocalizations). If the primary author disagreed with the original
transcription on canonical syllables, the transcription
was changed to reflect the principal investigator's perception. This procedure was intended to reduce the amount
of variability across transcribers.
Broad transcription was used for all data. Designation of canonical syllables was based on perceptual judgment. The perceptual definition provided by Oller and
Eilers (1988) for a canonical syllable was used. Briefly,
canonical syllables had (a) at least one fully resonant
nucleus (i.e., vowel with an identifiable quality), (b) one
nonglottal margin (consonant other than glottal stop or
glottal fricative), (c) duration of syllable and formant
transitions that fit within the range of mature syllable
production (perceptually), and (d) normal phonation and
pitch range. Oller (1986) provided acoustic parameters
for each of these aspects of the syllable. Acoustic analyses were not performed to verify categorization of canonical syllables. Therefore, it is possible that some
slow-transition syllables, known as marginal syllables,
were included in the analysis. Noncanonical vocalizations were perceptually judged as containing vowel-like
or consonant-like qualities that did not meet the criteria for the well-formed syllable (i.e., SVs [e.g., /a / ] or SCs
[e.g., /m /, /v/]). CVs bounded by glottal consonants in
initial or final position (i.e., / h /, i]) were considered GSs.
For consonants, four places of consonantal articulation were specified: labial (i.e., [p, b, m, w, B]), coronal
(i.e., [t, d, n, z, s, |, q, 8, P, tP, dP, l, j]), dorsal (i.e., [ k, g, :,
x]), and glottal (i.e., [ h, i]). Although some uvular consonants were transcribed, they represented less than 5%
of each infant's inventory and, thus, were not included in
the place analysis. Consonants were also classified in
terms of the following manner categories: plosive (i.e.,
[p, b, t, d, k, g, i]), nasal (i.e., [n, m, :]), fricatives and
affricates (i.e., [b f, v, z, s, |, q, 8, P, tP, dP, h, x]), and approximants (i.e., [ l, a]). All phones were transcribed
regardless of whether they appear in the English language. Vowel front-back dimensions were specified as
front (i.e., [i, i, e, e, y, &]), central (i.e., [}, L, a]), or back (i.e.,
[u, O, o, t, A]). Vowels were also classified by height as
high (i.e., [ y, i, i, u,O]), mid (i.e., [e, e, o, t, }, L]), or low (i.e.,
[&, a, A]). Vocalizations separated by approximately 1 s
were considered to be different utterances. Sound Studio
Classic software (Kwok, 2001) was used to verify utterance boundaries. Global symbols (Oller, 1990) were used
to categorize utterances that were not transcribable and
included untranscribable nuclei (UNs), untranscribable
consonants (UCs), and untranscribable vowels (UVs). If
the primary transcriber could not determine the vocalic
or consonantal quality of a sound or sequence, the token
was classified as either UC or UV if produced in isolation. If an entire utterance was untranscribable, it was

marked "UN." These tokens were highly ambiguous and
could be described as garbled articulations, with little
resonance or identifiable vocalic or consonantal qualities.
Vegetative and reflexive sounds (e.g., cries, burps, grunts,
coughs, and hiccups) were not transcribed. All transcribable vocalizations regardless of the mood (e.g., playful,
complaining) were transcribed if they contained identifiable tokens (singleton consonants [SCs], SVs, marginal
syllables [ MSs], CV, VC).

Data Analysis
Transcribed data were analyzed using the Logical International Phonetics Program (LIPP; Oller & Delgado,
1990). LIPP analysis included (a) CBR; (b) the percentage of utterances containing at least one canonical syllable; (c) inventory of vocalization types within utterance
strings such as SVs and SCs, GSs (h+V, i+V), and canonical syllables (CV, VC, CVC, VCV, etc.); (d) inventory
of canonical syllable shapes (CV, VC, CVC, and VCV);
(e) number of syllable sequences (mono-, di- and polysyllabic); (f ) consonant onset in canonical CVs (coronal, labial, dorsal); and (g) consonant place analysis of canonical
syllables and GSs. A description of each follows.
Vocalization types within utterance strings. An inventory of utterances defined as a string of sequenced
vocalizations (canonical syllables or noncanonical syllables) uttered in a single-breath group and bounded by 1 s
of silence or parental utterance was generated. An utterance could contain any number of sequences. For
example, an utterance could contain a string of syllabic
vocalizations and singletons, such as [ba ba ab a]; sequences of singletons only, such as [m: a a a]; or a
sequence that contained UNs mixed with canonical syllables and singletons (e.g., [ N di a]) as long as they belonged to the one-breath group. The contents of each
utterance string were classified into the following categories: singleton vocalizations such as SVs and SCs,
GSs, those bounded by glottal consonants, and canonical
syllabic (CS) output (CV, VC, CVC, VCV, etc.) bounded at
the onset or offset by labial, coronal, and dorsal consonants. For example, the utterance containing [untranscribable, di a] was coded as UN, CS, SV.
Canonical syllable patterns. Utterances containing
canonical syllables were further analyzed to obtain the
number of syllable sequences in each utterance, canonical syllable shape, consonant onset in canonical syllables of CV shape, and consonant inventory appearing
in any syllabic context. Only utterances containing canonical syllables were analyzed. For canonical syllable
sequence analysis, the number of consecutive syllable
sequences within each utterance was counted. If a vocalization string consisted of a single canonical syllable,
it was classified as monosyllabic (i.e., [ba]). If it contained

two consecutive syllables, it was classified as disyllabic
(i.e., [ba ba]). Utterances with more than two canonical
syllables were classified as polysyllabic (i.e., [ba ba ba]).
Canonical syllables were further analyzed in terms of
syllable shape (e.g., CV, VC, CVC, and VCV). Finally,
consonant-onset inventories were based on the consonant
onset of each initial CV canonical syllable, because these
are the shapes most frequently occurring in hearing
infants.
Statistical analysis. For purposes of analysis, the
PTA for all infants in the normal-hearing group was
assumed to be 25 dB HL. Similarly, for those infants who
had no response to some frequencies, a threshold value
of 120 dB HL was entered for analysis. The data are
presented in tabular form. In addition, for each inventory analyzed (e.g., vocalization types, syllable shape),
regression analyses were used to determine any significant associations between the infants' better ear, unaided PTA (dependent variable) and inventory type (e.g.,
canonical syllable presence, canonical syllable shape,
number of canonical syllable sequences, consonant onset in canonical syllables of CV shape, and vocalization
types within utterances). For example, for the analysis
of syllable sequences, three regression analyses were
performed, one for each of the sequences examined (monosyllabic, disyllabic, and polysyllabic). For each regression
performed, a t value, p value, and R2 value are reported
when significance was obtained. A probability value of .05
was considered significant, and a Bonferroni correction
was applied for each set of regression analyses to control for the possibility of Type I error. The analyses determined whether the relationship between PTA and the
independent variables was significant across the 15 infants, not across the hearing-loss groups.

Results
Reliability
Twenty percent of each infant's tokens were randomly chosen and digitized on a digital audiotape (DAT).
A phonetician with over 10 years experience transcribing hearing and hearing-impaired infant vocalizations
retranscribed these tokens. Both the first author and
the phonetician participated in biweekly transcription
training sessions over a 2-year period. The second transcriber was blind to the hearing status of the infant producing the tokens, but the first transcriber was not.
Reliability was determined on four parameters: (a) canonical versus noncanonical syllables, (b) canonical syllable
shape, (c) vocalization types, and (d) consonant place-
manner agreement.
Agreement on whether tokens were considered canonical or noncanonical was obtained first. The transcribers

categorized each token within an utterance as canonical
or noncanonical. For example, for an utterance such as [a
di], the SV was considered a noncanonical token and [di]
was considered a canonical syllable. The utterance was
coded as [noncanonical, canonical]. If the second transcriber recorded [ia ni], it was coded as [noncanonical,
canonical] and counted as 100% agreement. If the second
transcriber recorded [da ni] as [canonical, canonical], one
disagreement was counted. Agreement on this dimension
ranged from 84% to 100% across infants. The overall
mean agreement was 91%.
For each utterance in the 20% sample, the two transcriptions were compared to determine the level of agreement for vocalization types appearing within utterances
(i.e., UN, SV, SC, GS, CS). Agreement varied from 66% to
96%, with an overall average of 75%. The most frequently
occurring disagreements (50%) involved transcription of
SVs as GSs (25%, usually [i +V ]) and vice versa (25%).
The second most frequently occurring disagreement involved transcription of SVs as canonical syllables (18%).
These disagreement patterns accounted for 68% of all
disagreements (the remaining disagreements fell below
5% under different categories).
The third reliability analysis examined syllableshape agreement when canonical syllables were transcribed. Agreement across infants varied from 60% to
95%, with an overall average of 80% agreement for syllable shapes. Analysis of the disagreements showed that
in 28% of disagreements CVCs were transcribed as CVs,
in 20% VCVs as CVs, and in 5% VCs as CVs. CVs and VCs
were transcribed as nonsyllabic (23% and 7%, respectively) in 30% of cases. These patterns accounted for 83%
of disagreements.
Only consonant agreement is reported here, because
no analyses involved vowel production. Consonants were
compared in place and manner. Agreement was calculated using a multidimensional analysis procedure
discussed in Oller and Delgado (1990). Consonant agreement was 91% for both groups of infants with hearing
loss.
A total of 5,002 utterance strings were analyzed.
The hearing infants produced 1,225 (M = 306) utterance
strings, infants with mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss produced 1,959 (M = 326) utterance strings, and
the infants with severe-to-profound loss produced 1,818
(M = 363) utterance strings. Table 3 shows the mean
number of utterances for each infant and group. All subsequent analyses were based on these utterances.

Canonical Syllable Presence and CBR
All utterances were analyzed for the presence
of canonical syllables to determine whether PTA was

816

significantly associated with syllabic content appearing
in utterances. Utterances containing true canonical syllables were separated from those utterances that did not
contain canonical syllables (i.e., GSs or SVs). For example, when an utterance contained the sequence [bab
a a a], it was counted as containing canonical syllable
"presence." If an utterance contained [a ia a], the utterance was counted as having canonical syllable "absence."
Approximately 63% (SD = 8.4%) of the utterances produced by infants with normal hearing and 59% (SD =
20.0%) of those produced by infants with mild-tomoderately-severe hearing loss contained at least one
canonical syllable; only 28% (SD = 25.4%) of the utterances produced by infants with severe-to-profound hearing loss contained at least one canonical syllable. Table 3
shows the individual data for the percentage of utterances containing canonical syllable presence. The data
for the infants with hearing loss have large variability
compared with the infants with normal hearing. For
example, 4 of the infants with hearing loss (C.R., J.H.,
E.C., and G.W.) produced a higher percentage of utterances containing canonical syllables than the normalhearing infants. The association between the unaided
PTA and the percentage of utterances containing canonical
syllables across the infants was significant, t(13) = -3.81,
p < .00, R2 = .53, suggesting that PTA was a significant
factor determining the percentage of utterances that contained at least one canonical syllable.
The CBR was also calculated for each infant. The
ratio of the number of canonical syllables produced divided by the total number of utterances produced was
calculated. CBRs ranged from 0.08 to 2.10. Only 1 of the
15 infants was not in the canonical babbling stage according to the 0.2 criterion. Infants with normal hearing
and mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss had higher
CBRs on average (approximately 1.1 and 1.2, respectively) than infants in the severe-to-profound loss group,
with an average CBR of 0.66 (see Table 3). An analysis of
outliers performed using a jack-knife distance method
showed only 1 infant (G.W.) to be an outlier regarding
CBR (her CBR was in the range of normal). This method
calculates the distance for each observation with estimates of the mean and standard deviations that do not
include the observation itself. The data were analyzed
with and without this participant's information to determine the extent to which she affected results. Without
G.W., the regression analysis showed a significant relationship between CBR and PTA, t(13) = -0.53, p = .03,
R2 = .35, but was nonsignificant ( p = .10) with G.W.'s data
included. Infant G.W.'s data were not removed from the
dataset in subsequent analyses. The outlier analysis did
not identify any other infants as outliers, although there
was large variability in performance across the infants
with hearing loss.

Vocalization Types Within Utterances
An inventory of vocalization types within utterances
was compiled to determine what types of vocalizations,
in addition to canonical syllables, infants produced. A
total of 12,914 individual tokens were analyzed (3,993
vocalization types for infants with normal hearing, 4,838
for infants with mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss,
and 4,083 vocalization types for infants with severe-toprofound hearing loss). For infants with normal hearing,
approximately 12% of the inventory consisted of untranscribable tokens. SVs (15%) and SCs (9%) accounted for
approximately 23% of their inventory, and GSs (those
bounded by glottal stops or fricatives) accounted for approximately 8%. Canonical syllables including CV, VC,
CVC, and VCV shapes accounted for 57% of utterance
types within utterances. For infants with mild-tomoderately-severe hearing loss, 7% of the inventory consisted of untranscribable utterances. SVs (22%), and SCs
(7%), accounted for approximately 29% of the vocalization types in utterance strings. GSs accounted for 15%
of vocalization types, and canonical syllables accounted
for 50% of vocalization types. For infants with severeto-profound hearing loss, UNs accounted for 5% of the
overall inventory. SCs, SVs, GSs, and canonical syllables
accounted for 30%, 22%, 17%, and 26% of these infants'
vocalizations, respectively. The variability for infants with
hearing loss was higher than for infants with normal
hearing. Table 4 shows that the variability increased with
increasing hearing loss. Variability for infants with severeto-profound hearing loss was higher across all the vocalization categories than the variability of infants with
milder hearing losses.
To examine the relationships among PTA and vocalization types occurring within utterances, regression
analyses were calculated with PTA as the dependent
variable and SCs, vowels, and GSs each as independent
variables. The PTAwas significantly associated with SCs,
t(13) = 2.46, p = .03, R2 = .32. PTA was not associated with
SVs or GSs.

Number of Consecutive Canonical
Syllables in Utterances
Utterances containing canonical syllables were further analyzed for number of canonical syllables. Only utterances containing canonical syllables bounded by or
containing labial, coronal, or dorsal consonants (e.g., CV,
VC, CVC, and VCV) were analyzed. The number of consecutive syllables appearing within each utterance string
was counted. A total of 2,466 utterances containing sequenced syllable-based output were analyzed: 765 for the
hearing group, 1,153 for the mild-to-moderately-severe
group, and 548 for the severe-to-profound group, respectively. For all three groups, monosyllabic utterances were

with normal, mild-to-moderately-severe, and severe-toprofound hearing sensitivity, respectively. Utterances containing disyllables accounted for 29%, 20%, and 18% of
the respective inventories for infants with normal, mildto-moderately-severe, and severe-to-profound hearing
sensitivity. Last, polysyllabic sequences accounted for 17%,
21%, and 17% of each group, respectively (see Table 5). In
the regression analyses, we found no significant relationship among PTA and the percentage occurrence of mono-,
di-, and polysyllabic utterances in the corpora.

Canonical Syllable Shape
Canonical syllables were further analyzed in terms
of syllable shapes (e.g., CV, VC, CVC, and VCV). Results
are shown in Table 5. The total number of canonical syllables analyzed for normal-hearing infants was 1,485;
for infants with mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss,
2,430; and for infants with severe-to-profound hearing
loss, 1,362. The CV shape was the most predominant
shape in all three groups, accounting for 80%, 63%, and

59% of shapes for infants with normal, mild-to-moderatelysevere, and severe-to-profound hearing sensitivity, respectively. The CVC was the next most prominent
syllable shape for infants with normal and mild-tomoderately-severe hearing sensitivity, accounting for 12%
and 15% of syllable shapes, respectively. For infants with
severe-to-profound loss, CVC shapes accounted for only
6% of shapes. The second most prominent shape for these
infants was the VC shape, accounting for 25% of syllable
shape types. Regression analyses were used to examine
the relationship between PTA and each of the four syllable
shapes. A significant association was found between PTA
and VC shapes, t(13) = 2.9, p = .01, R 2 = .39. No other
syllable shape was associated with PTA.

Consonant Onset in Canonical CV Syllables
Because infants with normal hearing have a tendency to begin CV syllables with coronal consonants during babbling, we were interested in determining which
consonants were used at the onset of the CV canonical
syllable. An inventory of CV canonical syllables, classified

by consonant onsets, was created for each infant. A total
of 1,274 CV canonical syllables were analyzed for infants with normal hearing, 2,175 for infants with mildto-moderately-severe hearing loss, and 1,236 for infants
with severe-to-profound hearing loss. Syllable-onset preferences for infants with normal hearing were coronal (50%),
labial (37%), and dorsal (13%). For infants with mild-tomoderately-severe hearing loss, onset preferences were
as follows: 54% labial, 39% coronal, and 6% dorsal. Last,
for infants with severe-to-profound hearing loss, syllable
onsets were distributed as follows: 54% labial, 40% coronal, and 6% dorsal. Table 5 shows the consonant-onset
data averaged across the infants in each group. Regression analyses found no significant association between
the PTA and consonant-onset preference in canonical
syllables of CV shape.

inventories, the only consonant qualities that differentiate infants with hearing loss from infants with normal
hearing is an overabundance of "glottal sequences," particularly glottal stop sequences with vowel-like elements
(Oller, 1991). The glottal consonants [i] and [h] were analyzed separately, because previous research has indicated
that the overabundance of glottals only pertains to the
glottal stop [i] (Oller, 1991).
A total of 7,879 consonants was analyzed. This included 1,829 consonants for infants with normal hearing, 3,917 for those with mild-to-moderately-severe
hearing loss, and 2,133 for those with severe-to-profound
hearing loss. The consonants were produced in vocalic
context in initial, medial, or final position. An analysis of
consonant place for each group showed the following
patterns. For infants with normal hearing, consonant
place preferences included coronals (39%), labials (35%),
glottals (14%), and dorsals (11%). The glottal stop [i] and
glottal fricative [h] accounted for 3% and 11% of consonant place categories, respectively. For infants with
mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss, consonant place
patterns included labials (38%), glottals (30%), coronals
(26%), and dorsals (6%). The glottal stop [i] and glottal
fricative [h] accounted for 20% and 10% of consonant
place patterns, respectively. Last, the pattern for infants
with severe-to-profound hearing loss was similar to those
of infants with mild-to-moderately-severe hearing loss,
showing a preponderance of labials (45%), followed by
glottals (30%), coronals (22%), and dorsals (2%). The glottal stop [i] and glottal fricative [h] accounted for 23%
and 7% of consonant place patterns, respectively. Regression analyses were calculated to examine the association
of PTA and consonant use in any context. A significant
association was found for dorsal consonants, t(13) = -3.6,
p = .00, R 2 = .51. No other consonant associations were
found to be significant. Figure 1 shows the consonant
inventory for each group.

Discussion
In the present study, we examined prelinguistic vocalization patterns in 15 infants who were identified at
birth with varying degrees of hearing sensitivities, ranging from normal hearing to profound hearing loss. The
goal was to evaluate the relationship between hearing
sensitivity and early vocal patterns in the canonical babbling period. Babbling patterns for infants with normal
hearing have been detailed in a number of ways using
perceptual analyses, including the CBR, vocalization
types within utterances, syllable shapes, number of syllable sequences, and segmental inventories. These aspects of babbling have not been detailed previously in
one set of infants with varying degrees of hearing loss
who received amplification in the first year of life.

Figure 1. Percentage consonant inventory by place of articulation
for infants with estimated PTA of 25 dB HL (normal hearing),
better-ear PTA between 37 and 65 dB HL (mild to moderately
severe hearing loss), and infants with better-ear PTA greater than
85 dB HL (severe to profound hearing loss).

All infants, except 1, were effectively in the canonical babbling stage during the period of study. The
variables examined focused on vocalizations related to
utterance organization (percentage of utterances containing canonical syllable presence, CBR, and vocalization types in utterances) and to specific characteristics
of canonical syllables (i.e., number of sequenced canonical syllables, canonical syllable shape, consonant onset
in CV canonical syllables, and segmental inventory of
syllables). Hearing sensitivity was associated with the
percentage of utterances containing canonical syllables
and the types of vocalizations used within utterances.
However, hearing sensitivity was not generally associated with canonical syllable characteristics such as syllable shape (except for VCs), syllable sequencing, and
onset use, although some trends were observed related
to PTA. The results of the present study suggest that
even when the sensory and motor criteria that are required to instantiate canonical syllable production in infants with hearing loss are met, some babbling patterns
may differ from those observed in infants with normal
hearing. This pattern of results suggests that interactive
sensory- and production-system variables contribute to
the vocalizations observed in the earliest phases of vocalization emergence.
One of the most striking outcomes of this study
highlights the extent of the contribution of auditory sensitivity to the production of canonical syllables in utterances, which is considered the hallmark accomplishment
of hearing infants during this period of speech acquisition. According to Oller and Eilers (1988), the canonical
babbling stage is marked by a CBR of 0.2 or more. Two

important findings can be gleaned from Table 3, which
shows the CBR and the percentage of utterances containing canonical syllables for each infant in relation to PTA.
First, on average, the CBR and the percentage of utterances containing canonical syllable presence in the
infants with severe-to-profound hearing loss were lower
than those of the infants with normal and mild-tomoderately-severe hearing sensitivity. This pattern is
consistent with other studies reporting low CBRs in
infants with severe-to-profound hearing loss (e.g., Eilers
& Oller, 1994; Koopmans-van Beinum, Clement, & van
den Dikkenberg-Pot, 2001; Oller & Eilers, 1988; StoelGammon & Otomo, 1986). Despite early identification-
amplification, canonical syllable production in utterances
was significantly reduced in the infants with severe-toprofound levels of hearing loss, suggesting that early
amplification was not sufficient for triggering the patterns typically observed in infants with normal hearing
sensitivity.
Second, the data on CBR and canonical syllable presence in utterances also highlight the high levels of variability observed in the vocalizations produced by infants
with hearing loss. For the infants with PTAs greater than
85 dB HL, CBRs and canonical syllable presence data
do not seem to follow a predictable linear pattern. That is,
for 3 infants (J.H., E.C., and G.W.) with PTAs less than
85 dB HL, CBRs and percentage syllable presence were
higher than those observed for the infants with normal
hearing. The performance of the remaining infants with
PTAs less than 85 dB HL was either equal to or worse
than that of infants with normal hearing. Taken together,
these findings suggest that severe-to-profound hearing
loss exceeding a PTA of 100 dB HL results in low CBRs
and low percentage of utterances with canonical syllable
presence, whereas hearing loss with PTAs of less than
85 dB HL (and greater than 25 dB HL) can result in variable and unpredictable outcomes.
What factors might have contributed to the variability in the vocalizations observed, particularly for Infants
G.W. and J.H. (the 2 most extreme cases)? Were there
differences in intervention style, frequency, or signal
processing that might have led to differences in the CBR
and percentage of utterances containing canonical syllables for these infants? For example, Infant G.W. was
the only infant in the severe-to-profound group who wore
an individual FM unit at home, during most interactions
with the family. Did having access to a home FM system
account for G.W.'s high performance relative to the other
members of the severe-to-profound group? Because audibility was not confirmed with probe microphone measures, it is unknown how signal audibility might have
played a role in shaping this infant's vocalizations. In
terms of Infant J.H., it is difficult to speculate as to
why he varied so much relative to the other infants in

820

this cohort. J.H. was older than the other members in his
group, but he did not have as much hearing-aid experience as other members in his group. Factors such as
hearing age, signal audibility, and intervention type and
frequency should be controlled in future studies to better
determine their effects on vocalization output.
What vocalization types were infants with severe-toprofound hearing loss producing if approximately 72% of
their utterance strings did not contain canonical syllables?
Results showed that infants with severe-to-profound hearing loss appear to have explored different types of vocalizations, mainly singletons (consonant- and vowel-like
sounds) and GSs in contrast to canonical syllables. These
results are consistent with previously reported results on
infants with this level of impairment, showing a propensity for singleton consonants, vowels, and GSs and use
of few canonical syllables (McCaffrey et al., 2000; Oller,
1986; Stoel-Gammon & Otomo, 1986). Variability in vocalization types across infants increased with increasing
hearing loss. That is, variability was largest for infants
with severe-to-profound hearing loss relative to infants
with milder hearing loss and normal hearing. Future
studies should examine which factors account for the
variability observed. Are these patterns related to the
transcription method or does variability increase with
increased hearing loss?
Coronal and labial onsets are dominant in the canonical syllables of typically developing infants (BoyssonBardies & Vihman, 1991; Kent & Bauer, 1985; Vihman
et al., 1986). In general, for the infants with mild-tomoderately-severe and severe-to-profound hearing loss,
the syllable-onset patterns showed more frequent use
of labial than coronal onsets in canonical syllables of
CV shape, a reverse pattern from the hearing infants. An
increased use of labial consonants (and decrease in use
of coronals and dorsals) with increasing PTA was also
shown in the analysis of consonant place of articulation
appearing in canonical syllables. Both groups of hearingimpaired infants showed the same pattern, suggesting
an early reliance on the visual modality rather than on
the auditory modality, despite early amplification. In addition, an analysis of glottal consonant use showed an
increase in glottal stop [i] use and a decrease in glottal
fricative [h] use as PTA increased. Previous work on vocalizations of hearing-impaired infants has shown that
infants with severe-to-profound hearing loss tend to have
a higher occurrence of glottal [i] than hearing infants
(Oller, 1991). Oller showed that the highest proportion
of glottal sequences appearing in a sample of hearing
infants did not exceed 20%, with a mean of 4% to 5%.
Results from the present study confirm the patterns previously reported by Oller.
Results from this study indicate that inadequate auditory access to speech results in different speech develop-

ment patterns than those of hearing infants, even if the
hearing loss is mild, suggesting an early codependence of
auditory perceptual and speech-production factors in early
speech acquisition. Research in infant development suggests that the experience obtained through the coordination of movement-perception systems leads to the further
development of action skills. Additionally, perception-
action studies have suggested that repetition of active
behavior serves as a means to gain and strengthen
perceptual knowledge (Thelen & Smith, 1994), termed
embodied cognition (e.g., Johnson, 1987). Future studies
should continue to examine the relationship among audibility factors and the emergence of prelinguistic vocalizations in infants identified early with varying degrees
of hearing loss.
