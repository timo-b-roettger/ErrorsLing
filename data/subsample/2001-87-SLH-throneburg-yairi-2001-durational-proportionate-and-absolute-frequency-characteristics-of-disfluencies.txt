The main objective of this study was to investigate developmental aspects of
disfluencies over time as stuttering persists or ameliorates for 2 groups of
preschool age children who stutter. Results indicated that the frequency, type, and
duration of disfluencies remained relatively constant instead of increasing as
expected in the persistent group over a 3-year period. In contrast, the recovered
group's initially higher frequency of disfluency decreased over time, as did their
number of repetition units and proportion of disrhythmic phonations, while the
duration of silent intervals between repetition units and proportion of monosyllabic word repetitions increased.

ince Davis (1939) began systematic studies aimed at quantifying
disfluencies in speech of young children, much of the subsequent
research has attempted to delineate and compare the number and
types of disfluencies produced by normally speaking children and children who stutter. A comprehensive review of the rich literature on this
topic can be found in Yairi (1997). The findings of these studies have been
used to support (Johnson et al., 1959) or refute (Yairi & Lewis, 1984) theoretical notions about stuttering, such as the diagnosogenic model. Information regarding the frequency/type of disfluency has also been applied
clinically for the purpose of differential diagnosis between children who
do and do not stutter (e.g., Adams, 1977; Pindzola & White, 1986).
Taking a somewhat different approach to the measurement of
disfluent speech, several investigators analyzed children's disfluencies
in terms of the proportion of each disfluency type (e.g., Yairi, 1972; Yairi
& Lewis, 1984; Zebrowski, 1991). Their motivation was to investigate
qualitative rather than quantitative differences by identifying disfluency
patterns for groups that reflect the relative weight of each disfluency
type instead of the absolute frequency. There were also a few attempts
to consider the spatial distribution of disfluencies, that is, clustering
(Hubbard & Yairi, 1988; Lasalle & Conture, 1995).

More recently, interest in the dimension of length
of young children's disfluency has drawn increasing research activity. Two different metrics of length can be distinguished in this work. Ambrose and Yairi (1995, 1999)
investigated length as expressed in the number of iterations, or repetition units (a term first used by Johnson
et al. in 1959) produced during part-word and monosyllabic word repetitions. They demonstrated that the number of repetition units is a powerful means for discriminating between groups of normally fluent and stuttering
children. Zebrowski (1991), however, did not find a significant difference in the number of repetition units produced between normally fluent and stuttering children.
Other investigators interested in length have focused on the duration of disfluencies (e.g., Conture &
Kelly, 1991; Kelly & Conture, 1992; Louko, Edwards, &
Conture, 1990; Throneburg & Yairi, 1994; Yairi & Hall,
1993; Zebrowski, 1991). Zebrowski (1991) found no significant differences between the total duration of partword repetitions and sound prolongations of stuttering
and nonstuttering preschool children, although the repetitions of children who stutter were longer than their
sound prolongations. Kelly and Conture (1992) also
found no difference in the duration of within-word disfluencies between preschool age children who stuttered
and normally fluent controls. Conture and Kelly (1991)
reported that the longest within-word disfluencies were
repetitions (1,015 ms), followed by whole-word repetitions (870 ms) and sound prolongations (727 ms) for preschool age children who stuttered.
In a preliminary report, Yairi and Hall (1993) drew
attention to another duration measure of disfluency--the
interval between the iterations (repetition units) of a particular segment. Although their sample contained a small
number of children, they reported a trend (though not
statistically significant) for stuttering preschool age children to have shorter intervals between the repeated units
of monosyllabic word repetitions than their normally fluent peers. In a large follow-up study of more than 1,000
disfluent segments, however, Throneburg and Yairi (1994)
found that preschool children who stuttered exhibited
significantly shorter total duration of disfluencies than
normally fluent children. The finding was attributed primarily to substantially shorter silent intervals between
repeated units in part-word and word repetitions. In other
words, children who stutter repeated faster. The duration of the silent interval between repeated units differentiated stuttering from normally fluent children with
85-87% accuracy for single-unit repetitions and with 72%
accuracy for double-unit repetitions. In the same year,
Zebrowski (1994) investigated duration of disfluencies in
school age children who stuttered. She observed a negative correlation between the total duration of part-word
repetition and the rate at which repetitions were produced. Children who produced repetitions with longer

duration produced fewer repeated units per second. Children who produced more units of repetitions produced these
repetitions at a faster rate. Zebrowski also found a positive correlation between the number and length of prolongations produced. Thus the interaction between rate, number of repeated units, and duration appears to be complex.
The studies cited above reported disfluency measures obtained at a single point in time. Other research
has reported the developmental trends of childhood stuttering. Reports about preschool children's decreasing
disfluencies over time, eventually resulting in large percentages of recovery from stuttering (Andrews & Harris, 1964; Yairi & Ambrose, 1992, 1999) also heightened
interest in identifying early prognostic indicators for either recovery or persistency (Ambrose, Yairi, & Cox, 1997;
Yairi, Ambrose, Paden & Throneburg, 1996). These reports, however, were based primarily on disfluency counts
of a global index, stuttering-like disfluency (SLD), that
combines the number of part-word repetitions, singlesyllable word repetitions, and disryhthmic phonations.
They suggested that many children who recovered could
be differentiated from persisting participants based on
the number of SLDs by 12 months after stuttering onset.
Whereas the investigators cited above also considered other prognostic factors (including phonological skills
and patterns of familial inheritance of stuttering), they
did not longitudinally investigate other disfluency parameters, such as specific disfluency types, proportional patterns of disfluencies, and the duration of disfluencies. It
is interesting, however, that these disfluency parameters
have been listed in existing prognostic instruments. For
example, the Chronicity Prediction Checklist (Cooper &
Cooper, 1985) lists (among others) the following predictors of chronic stuttering: (a) the presence of sound prolongations and blocks, (b) part-word repetitions with more
than three units, (c) faster than normal tempo of repetition, and (d) prolongations longer than 1 second. The Stuttering Prediction Instrument for Young Children (Riley,
1981) lists risk criteria such as (a) more than three repeated units in part-word repetitions, (b) part-word repetitions repeated "abnormally," (c) presence of prolongations and blocks, and (d) frequency of disfluencies per
100 words. Conture (1990) stated that the high proportion (more than 25%) of sound prolongations might be
indicative of persisting and that the duration of disfluencies decreases just before recovery. Unfortunately, many
of these ideas were drawn from clinical impression, not
from research-based data. For example, there has been
no research on how the duration characteristics of
disfluencies near the onset of stuttering change with time
as the stuttering improves or worsens.
The overall frequency of stuttering-like disfluency
in relation to persistency and recovery have been presented in other reports for a larger number of children

by Yairi and his colleagues (e.g., Yairi & Ambrose, 1999;
Yairi, Ambrose, Paden, & Throneburg, 1996). In this
article, however, we examine the frequency and proportional occurrence of specific disfluency types. The number, rate, and duration of repeated units within partword and monosyllabic word repetitions, and total
duration of stuttering-like disfluencies, studied longitudinally as stuttering persisted or ameliorated in two
groups of young children who stutter, are also reported.
Because data from each child required extensive timeconsuming analyses of acoustic data, the number of children in the present study had to be limited.

Method
Participants
The participants were chosen from the pool of preschool children included in the longitudinal investigation of the Stuttering Research Project at the University of Illinois (Yairi, et al., 1996) that was available at
the time this study was initiated in 1995. The children
met the following multiple criteria to be admitted into
the longitudinal stuttering research project at the University of Illinois: (a) age 6 or below, (b) regarded by
parents as having a stuttering problem, (c) regarded by
two investigators as having a stuttering problem, (d)
stuttering history of no longer than 12 months, (e) stuttering severity rated by parents as at least 2 on an 8point scale (0 = normal speech, 1 = borderline, 2 = mild
stuttering, 3 = mild-to-moderate, 4 = moderate, 5 =
moderate-to-severe, 6 = severe, 7 = very severe stuttering), (f) stuttering severity rated by investigators as 2
or higher, (g) exhibiting at least three stuttering-like
disfluencies (SLDs include part-word repetitions, monosyllabic word repetitions, and disrhythmic phonation)
per 100 syllables of spontaneous speech; and (h) no obvious neurological disorders or abnormalities.
The subset of children included in this study comprised two groups--persistent and recovered. Children
who were classified as evidencing persistent stuttering
when this study was initiated met the following criteria: (a) regarded by parents and investigators as having
a stuttering problem, (b) stuttering severity rated as at
least 2 on an 8-point scale for a minimum of 36 months
after stuttering onset, and (c) currently continued to
stutter at the last visit prior to initiation of this study.
At the time this study began, 1 girl and 9 boys had continued stuttering for 36 months or more after stuttering onset and were included in the persistent group. Nine
of these 10 children have been followed for an additional
4 years, and all continue to evidence stuttering in their
speech. The 10 children classified as persistent stutterers ranged in age from 30 to 59 months, with a mean
age of 43.4 months, at the time of their initial visit to
40

the stuttering research project. None of the participants
in the persistent group had received therapy prior to their
initial visit to the stuttering research project when the
first speech sample was recorded. Nine of the 10 participants in the persistent group received fluency therapy
at later times for various periods but they persisted in
stuttering despite therapy. One child did not receive
therapy until after the time period covered in this study.
Children in the recovered group evidenced stuttering during at least two visits at the stuttering research
project prior to being judged as recovered. Recovery occurred by 29 months post onset. Other children who recovered very quickly, and were only seen stuttering at
one visit at our project, were not included in the present
study's recovered group because the dynamics of how
disfluencies changed as recovery occurred could not be
described. The criteria for classifying a child as recovered included: (a) clinical judgment made by the investigators that the child did not exhibit a stuttering problem, (b) parent judgment that the child did not exhibit a
stuttering problem, (c) parent rating of stuttering severity as less than 1, (d) investigator rating of stuttering
severity as less than 1, (e) fewer than three SLDs per 100
syllables, and (f) continue to meet these criteria for at
least 12 consecutive months. At the time this study was
initiated 10 participants met the above criteria and had
not received any speech therapy for fluency. These participants included 2 girls and 8 boys, ranging in age from
37 to 49 months (mean age = 41.9 months) at the time of
the initial visit. At the present time, all of the recovered
participants have maintained their recovered status for
more than 4 years.

Speech Samples
Conversational speech was audio- and videotaped
in a sound-treated room during the initial evaluation
and follow-up visits every 6 months for a period of at
least 3 years. Of course, at the time of the initial evaluation and first visits, the eventual development and classification of the children was not known. Each visit consisted of two sessions, separated by 1 week, during which
a speech sample was obtained. Speech was recorded
during verbal interaction with one parent and one investigator. Standard toys (e.g., Play-Doh) and questions
were used to elicit conversation.
Speech samples were approximately 1,000 syllables.
Seven disfluency categories or types were identified:
(a) part-word repetition, (b) monosyllabic word repetition, (c) disrhythmic phonation (sound prolongations and
blocks), (d) multisyllable word repetition, (e) phrase repetition, (f) interjection, and (g) revision/incomplete
phrase. The first three disfluency types, termed stuttering-like disfluencies, were used in the analysis procedures of the present study.

Five of the project's staff members, each having several hundred hours of experience with disfluency analysis, transcribed the tapes orthographically and identified disfluencies. The recordings were played and
replayed until the listener was satisfied that each instance of disfluency had been correctly identified and classified in the appropriate category. Each tape-recorded
sample initially analyzed by the staff, was independently
scrutinized again by the first author and a second senior investigator in the Stuttering Research Project.
Interjudge reliability (point-by-point for location and
type of disfluency) was .84. Interjudge reliability for
counting the number of repetition units in part- and
monosyllabic word repetitions between the staff members and the first author was .86. Following reliability
calculations, some instances of disagreement were resolved through repeated listening. For the sake of consistency, however, the final classifications/counts were
always determined based on the judgment of the first
author and another senior investigator, who had the
most experience with the tasks.

Recording Visits
Speech samples were obtained during the initial
evaluation and follow-up visits every 6 months for a period of at least 3 years for the large group of children who
participated in the stuttering research project. Speech
samples from three visits per participant were analyzed
for the purposes of this study. The initial evaluation, was
held within 12 months of stuttering onset and was analyzed for participants of both groups. The mean post onset interval was 7 months (range = 5 to 12 months) for
the persistent group and 5 months (range = 1 to 12
months) for the recovered group at the first visit. For the
persistent group, a second speech sample was analyzed
which was obtained at 19 to 24 months post-onset (M =
20 months), and a third sample was analyzed from a visit
at 31 to 36 months post-onset (M = 32 months).
The children in the recovered group were judged to
recover from stuttering at different times from 13 to 29
months post stuttering onset. A second sample (in addition to the initial visit) was analyzed while the recovered children were still stuttering and within the first 2
years of stuttering onset. The time of this prerecovery
visit ranged from 7 to 23 months post onset (M = 13
months). Third samples were analyzed from the visit
when recovery criteria were first met, at 13 to 29 months
post-onset (M = 19 months). This was termed the
"postrecovery" visit.

Duration of Disfluencies
The marked transcripts of the tape-recorded speech
samples for the three visits of each group were inspected

to select disfluent segments for acoustic analysis. A
minimum of two and maximum of 10 instances of each
of the following disfluency types per visit per participant were chosen: (a) part-word repetitions with one unit
(e.g., b-but), (b) part-word repetitions with two units
(e.g., b-b-but), (c) part-word repetitions with three units
(e.g., b-b-b-but), (d) monosyllabic word repetitions with
one unit (e.g., but-but), (e) monosyllabic word repetitions
with two units (e.g., but-but-but), (f) monosyllabic word
repetitions with three units (e.g., but-but-but-but),and
(g) disrhythmic phonations (e.g., blocks such as b-ut, or
prolongations, mmmmmy). Given the above criteria and
qualifications, the durations of 1,669 disfluent events
were measured from their acoustic signals. When a participant produced more than 10 disfluencies of a particular type, the first 10 measurable disfluencies were
used. Because the number of available disfluencies of
each type differed among children, mean values for duration were first calculated for each participant rather
than combining the productions of all children. Group
data were then derived from these individual means so
that each participant was weighted equally.

Instrumentation
Participants' conversational speech during verbal
interaction with an adult was audio-recorded in an IAC
sound-proof room using a Crown PPC-160w phase coherent cardioid microphone. The microphone was connected to a Yamaha KM608 preamplifier (mixer). The
audio signal was then directed to a Tascam 122 MKII
stereo cassette recorder with Maxell II S-90 recording
cassette tapes.
For acoustic analyses, the audio signal was transmitted through a low-pass filter (Frequency Devices
Model 901) with a high-frequency cutoff at 7.5 kHz to
one channel of a Data Translation 2821 series analogto-digital (A/D) converter board that interfaces with a
microprocessor-based personal computer. A software
system for digital signal processing of the acoustic signal, CSpeech Version 4 (Milenkovic, 1995), was used.
Disfluent events, as defined above, that met the criteria
of being clear of interfering noise, were low-pass filtered
at 7.5 KHz, digitized at 20,000 samples per second, and
stored on a computer disk. Acoustic measurements were
made from an FFT-based spectrogram display and corresponding time waveform (Milenkovic, 1995).

Acoustic Measurement of Duration
To increase the accuracy of determining the onset
and offset points of measured speech segments, expanded representations of both the time waveform and
corresponding FFT-based spectrographic display of each
disfluency were visually inspected and verified through

playback of the auditory signal. The duration of identified sound prolongations was measured from the onset
of acoustic energy associated with the prolonged sound
to the cessation of its acoustic energy. In the case of blocks
within words, the period of cessation of acoustic energy
associated with a fixed articulatory posture (Conture,
1990), and no voicing was measured. Onset and offset
points were systematically determined by manipulating the vertically oriented cursors, using the spectral
energy of specific segments, the time waveform and audio playback of the speech sample. When onsets and offsets could not be reliably identified, that disfluent event
was excluded. A sample of the visual display of a prolongation is presented in Figure 1 with cursors placed at
the initiation and termination of the prolonged sound.
For part-word and monosyllabic word repetitions,
the duration was measured for the entire disfluency as
well as for each repeated unit and the interval between
unit(s) that constituted that event. Duration was measured from the onset of acoustic energy associated with
the initial disfluent sound in the word to the cessation

of acoustic energy for the iteration of the repeated sound,
syllable, or word. Onset was visually defined as the first
peak (maximum amplitude in millivolts) that corresponded with a burst of spectral energy of the spectrogram. When spoken segments where followed by silent
intervals (e.g., the interval between the segments bubut), the offset was defined as the last consecutive peak.
Although the effect of coarticulation could not be controlled for, when the repeated spoken segment was immediately followed by another consonant or vowel (that
is, there was no silent interval), the boundary was determined by examining changes in formant direction
and/or declination in spectral power associated with the
termination of the repeated sound. The boundaries were
also verified through auditory playback of marked segments. A sample of the visual display of a part-word repetition is presented in Figure 2.
For single-unit part-word repetition (e.g., o-only),

C), the repeated portion of second spoken segment

(points C and D) were marked. The durations in milliseconds between each pair of points and between point
A and D (total duration) were determined for each
disfluent episode in this classification (see Figure 2).
For monosyllabic word repetition with two repeated
units (e.g., to-to-to), the duration of the first spoken segment (points A and B), the first silent interval (points B
and C), the second spoken unit (points C and D), the second silent interval (points D and E), the final spoken segment (points E and F) and total duration (between points
A and F) were measured in milliseconds (see Figure 3).
All acoustic measurements were performed by the
first author. Intrajudge reliability for these data were
calculated by the first author remeasuring 10% of the
segments of each of the seven types of disfluencies (a
total of 165 disfluencies). Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two sets of data was .97. Interjudge
reliability between the investigator and another experimenter for acoustic measurements was calculated in a

similar manner as just described. The Pearson correlation was .95.

Results
Results reported in the following sections include
the frequency of disfluency types, their proportional distribution, number of repetition units, total duration for
the different types of disfluencies, duration for segments
within part- and monosyllabic word repetitions, and the
rate of repetition production for part- and monosyllabic
word repetitions. Data for each measure will be presented for the initial visit. Next, longitudinal data for
second and third visits will be presented. For the persistent group the three visits covered a period of 2 years.
For the recovered group, the first two samples were obtained from visits prior to recovery whereas the third
sample was obtained from the visit when recovery criteria were first met. Comparisons will not be made between

Frequency, Proportions, and Repetition
Units of Speech Disfluencies
The Distribution of Disfluency
at the Initial Visit
In Table 1, the first row of data for each of the two
groups presents the detailed frequency, proportion, and
repetition units information at the initial visit. At that
time, most of the participants in the persistent group
exhibited moderate-to-severe stuttering. Their mean
SLD per 100 syllables was 9.47. The corresponding
mean for the recovered group was 16.17, indicating
greater stuttering frequency. Results of a multivariate
analysis of variance for the frequency of stuttering-like
disfluencies (part-word repetition, monosyllabic word
44

repetitions, and disrhythmic phonations) indicated
there was a significant difference between the groups
at the initial visit, F(3, 16) = .542, p = .005. Follow-up
univariate tests indicated there was a significant difference between the groups in the frequency of monosyllabic word repetitions (p = .002), but not the frequency of part-word repetitions (p = .07) or disrhythmic
phonations (p = .84).
For both groups at the initial visit, part-word repetitions constituted the largest proportion (approximately 50%) of the total SLD, with monosyllabic word
repetitions second, and disrhythmic phonations third.
Proportionally, the persistent group produced twice as
many (16%) disrhythmic phonations within the total
SLD than the recovered group (8%). An arcsine transformation was applied to the proportional data and the differences between the groups were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance. Results of the MANOVA

indicated there were no significant differences between
the groups in the proportional distribution of disfluencies
at the initial visit F(3, 16) = .208; p = .28.
The recovered group produced a larger mean number of repetition units per instance of part-word and
monosyllabic word repetition than the persistent group
(1.74 vs. 1.41). This difference, however, did not reach
statistical significance, F(1, 18) = 3.355, p = .08.

Changes in the Distribution of
Disfluency Over Time
Results of a repeated-measures MANOVA indicated
that the change in the frequency of stuttering-like
disfluencies across visits was not significant for the persistent group over time, F(3, 6) = .81, p = .29. The proportional distribution of disfluencies remained quite
stable over the entire period of observation, with partword repetitions as the dominant disfluency type. There
was no change in the proportion of disrhythmic phonation in the persistent group. Arcsine transformations
were applied to the proportional data and a repeatedmeasures MANOVA indicated there was not a change
in the proportional distribution of disfluencies over time
for the persistent group F(4, 6) = .36, p = .86. The number of repetition units also remained consistent over time
F(2, 18) = .35, p = .71.
As the children in the recovered group reached and
passed the recovery criteria, their disfluencies pattern
changed and monosyllabic word repetitions became the
most frequent disfluency type, whereas disrhythmic
phonation almost disappeared. Arcsine transformations
were applied to the proportional data. Results of a repeated-measures MANOVA indicated there was a significant change across visits in the proportional occurrence of disfluencies for the recovered group, F(4, 6) =
.94, p = .02. Follow-up univariate tests indicated the significant change occurred in the proportional occurrence

of disrhythmic phonation (p = .003) as it declined with
time to 1% of the total SLD. During the process of recovery, the children also decreased the mean number of repetition units within repetitions from 1.74 initially to 1.10.
The final number was similar to that reported for normally fluent children (Yairi & Lewis, 1984). The recovered group's change across visits in the mean number of
repetition units was significant, F(2, 18) = 8.34, p < .01.

Total Duration of Disfluencies
Measurements of total duration in milliseconds were
obtained for the three disfluency types that constitute
stuttering-like disfluencies. The mean total duration for
repetitions with different numbers of repeated units was
calculated separately. All children who produced a minimum of two measurable disfluencies for any given type
were included in group means for that type. Monosyllabic word repetitions of three units occurred too infrequently to be analyzed. In the recovered group, none of
the children produced sufficient measurable part-word
repetitions of three units at the pre- and post-recovery
visits, or of monosyllabic word repetitions of two units
or disrhythmic phonation at the post-recovery visit. Data
for the total duration of disfluencies for each group at
each visit for part-word repetitions with one, two, and
three units, monosyllabic word repetitions with one and
two units, and disrhythmic phonation are presented in
Table 2.

Total Duration of Disfluencies
at the Initial Visit
A MANOVA revealed there were no statistically significant differences in the mean duration of part-word
and monosyllabic word repetitions with one to two units
between the groups at the initial visit [F(4, 10) = .54,
p = .71]. Part-word repetitions with three units and

disrhythmic phonation were not analyzed statistically
because of the smaller number of participants who produced two or more measurable disfluencies.

the spoken repetition units and the silent interval(s)
between spoken repetition units is included and expressed in milliseconds. The rate of repetition was calculated by dividing the number of spoken units by the
total duration of the disfluency and is expressed in units
per second. Data for double-unit monosyllabic word repetitions are not presented for the recovered group's postrecovery visit because there were not enough instances
from which to obtain individual and group means.

Change in Total Duration of
Disfluencies Over Time
There were sufficient data for only part-word and
monosyllabic word repetitions of one unit to be statistically analyzed meaningfully over the three visits. The
magnitude of the reduction in multiple unit repetitions
and disrhythmic phonation left too few data points across
any given subject to allow inclusion of the other variables in the analysis (i.e., different subjects were missing data points for different disfluencies, and any blank
took that subject out of the analysis).

Duration of Single-Unit Word
Repetitions at the Initial Visit
Results of a multivariate analysis of variance for
the segments within monosyllabic word repetition with
a single repeated unit revealed there were no significant differences between the groups in any of the segments at the initial visit, F(3, 18) = .678, p = .578.

A repeated measures MANOVA was performed to
evaluate the change in duration of one-unit part-word
and monosyllabic repetitions across the three visits.
Results indicated nonsignificant changes for the persistent group [F(4, 5) = 2.08, p = .22] or the recovered group
[F(4, 6) = .16, p = .95].

Changes in the Duration of Single-Unit
Word Repetitions Over Time
Table 3 indicates that the duration of the spoken
units in single-unit word repetitions showed relatively
little changes across visits for either group. The duration of the final (second) repetition unit, however, was
shorter than the initial repetition unit for both groups
at all visits. There was a significant difference between
the duration of the first and second repetition unit, F(1,
18) = 44.97, p < .001.

The table reveals considerable within-group variation as evidenced by the standard deviation values. Differences between groups or across visits for all of the
measures are relatively small.

Duration of Segments Within
Monosyllabic Word Repetitions

For the persistent group, a repeated-measures
MANOVA indicated that there were no statistically
significant differences over time for any of the segments
within single-unit word repetitions, F(4, 6) = .45; p = .82.

The mean absolute duration of the various segments
within monosyllabic word repetition with one and two
repeated units is presented in Table 3. The duration of

between the groups in the duration of the spoken units,
F(1, 15) = 3.16, p = .09. There was, however, a significant difference between the initial repetition units and
the final (third) production for both groups F(2, 30) =
8.31, p = .001. The interaction between group and spoken unit was not significant, F(2, 30) = .71, p = .498. A
multivariate analysis of variance, however, revealed
there were no significant differences between the groups
in the duration of segments within monosyllabic word

Discussion

The mean absolute duration of the various segments
within part-word repetition with one and two repeated
units is presented in Table 4. The duration of the spoken repetition units and the silent interval(s) between
repetition units are included and expressed in milliseconds. The rate of repetition was calculated similarly to
that described earlier.

Duration of Single-Unit Part-Word
Repetitions at the Initial Visit
The duration of the spoken repetition units within
single-unit part-word repetitions was similar for the two
groups at the initial visit. A multivariate analysis of
variance revealed there were no significant differences
between the groups in the duration of segments within
part-word repetition with one repeated unit at the initial visit, F(3, 16) = 2.00, p = .15.

Changes in Duration of Single-Unit
Part-Word Repetitions Over Time
The duration of the repetition units was similar for
the two groups and did not appear to change over time.
For both groups, the duration of the first repetition unit
(range = 208 to 256 ms) tended to be longer than the final
repetition unit (range = 183 to 221 ms). There was a significant difference between the duration of the first and
48

Statistics were not performed on differences across
time for either group because of the small number of
participants who produced two or more measurable
double-unit part-word repetitions at later visits.

The main motivation of this study was to further
pursue the differentiation between two subgroups of
young children who stutter, those who persist and those
who recover, on disfluency parameters not investigated
before. This was done by comparing the groups when
they were first evaluated soon after stuttering onset (and
had not received therapy), a point when their eventual
classification was not known yet. Both groups were then
followed longitudinally as stuttering persisted for one,
but ameliorated for the other. The distribution characteristics of several types of disfluency, as well as measures of length of disfluency, were analyzed.

Initial Differences
The primary findings of the present study indicate
that soon after onset there were very few significant differences in measures of disfluencies between children who
eventually became persistent and those who recovered
from stuttering. Although the study found few statistically significant differences initially between the groups,
acceptance of the null hypotheses of no differences between the groups should be done only with great caution.
There is a critical need for replication of the current study
by other independent investigators. The current results
are important, however, in that they are the first to question many existing beliefs about differences between children who will persist or recover from stuttering, which

have influenced clinical decisions and counseling.
The results for the present subset of participants
reflect findings reported for a much larger number of
stuttering children (Yairi & Ambrose, 1999), indicating
that at the very early stage of stuttering the overall level
of stuttering-like disfluency is not an indicator of risk
for persistency. In fact, the children who eventually recovered were more disfluent at the initial visit than the
children who persisted. Additionally, no statistically significant differences were found in the initial patterns of
the proportional distribution of disfluencies. For both
groups, more than 80% of stuttering-like disfluencies at
the first visit consisted of part-word repetition and monosyllabic word repetition. Disrhythmic phonation was a
considerably less prominent feature.
The more detailed analysis in the present study also
allows for a better assessment of existing prognostic instruments. Although the present study was based on only
20 children, the data do not support those instruments that
suggest that a high frequency of disfluencies and a large
number of repetition units constitute danger signs for persistence. The Chronicity Prediction Checklist (Cooper &
Cooper, 1985) considers disfluency on 5% or more of words
uttered for periods of 6 months as indicative of chronic stuttering. In the present investigation, both the recovered and
persistent groups met this criterion at the initial visit. Similarly, according to the Stuttering Prediction Instrument for
Young Children (Riley, 1981) disfluency instances containing three or greater repetition units are signs of impending
persistent stuttering. Again, the present data show that
neither group produced an average of more than three repeated units. Also the tendency of the persistent group to
have a higher proportion of disrhythmic phonation at the
early stage of stuttering was not significant and failed to
support current assumptions in this regard (Conture, 1990;
Curlee, 1980, Riley, 1981, Van Riper, 1982).
There are also several important observations from
the durational data. First, findings for the total duration
of disfluency at the initial visit appear to be comparable
to several previous reports (Conture & Kelly, 1991; Kelly
& Conture, 1992; Zebrowski, 1991). Based on the present
and past reports for somewhat different ages and length
of stuttering history, we conclude that the duration of
repetition and disrhythmic phonation average less than
1 second within the first 3 years of stuttering.
Second, the nonsignificant differences between the
groups are again useful in assessing existing clinical
beliefs as they do not support the assumption made in
the Stuttering Prediction Instrument (Riley, 1981) and
the Chronicity Prediction Checklist (Cooper & Cooper,
1985) that longer blocks and prolongations serve as
warnings of persistence. Both groups produced disrhythmic phonations that averaged approximately 650
ms long at the initial visit.

In general, it appears that the contradictions discussed above may possibly be explained by age differences and the length of the stuttering history. A review
of existing prediction instruments reveals that many of
the items appear to pertain to children who have stuttered for longer than children in the present study who
were first seen within 1 year of stuttering. Therefore,
although high level of disfluency and larger number and
proportion of disrhythmic phonation may be a differentiating factor later in the development of stuttering (Yairi
et. al., 1996), they are not at the very early stage of the
disorder. Such contradictions point out the need for continued validation of prediction instruments with careful longitudinal investigations that trace the disorder
from very early stages.

Developmental Trends
Persistent Group
When evaluating the developmental trends of stuttering-like disfluencies produced by the persistent group,
the expected increases were not observed. Although none
of the persistent participants received intervention prior
to the initial visit within the first year of stuttering onset, 9 of the persistent participants received some
therapy at different times within the first 3 years of stuttering onset. The type, frequency, and duration of intervention were not controlled for in the present study.
Therefore, the developmental trends of disfluency productions by the persistent group must be interpreted
cautiously in this regard.
Both the overall level of SLD and proportional distribution of the three specific types of disfluency remained
relatively stable, with part-word repetitions being the
dominant disfluency type for the persistent group. These
findings raise questions concerning the traditional views
that, as a rule, the disorder becomes progressively worse
and that sound prolongations and blocks increasingly
become the dominant feature of stuttering (Bloodstein,
1961). For example, the Stuttering Prediction Instrument
(Riley, 1981) emphasizes increased severity of disfluencies
as an indication of persistence. Our reservations in regard to these views are limited to the first 3 years after
onset of the disorder. This, however, is the critical period
for which prognosis is most urgent. It is possible that the
developmental trends described in previous sources take
place at later stages of the disorder.
The nonsignificant change in the duration and rate
of repetitions over a 2-year period (within the first 3
years of stuttering onset) for the persistent group, did
not agree with expectations. Again, although statistically nonsignificant, these findings are still important
in evaluating traditional assumptions. The data contradict the notions that, as stuttering continues, repetitions
become more rapid and irregular (Bloodstein 1960a,
Throneburg & Yairi: Durational Characteristics in Persistence and Recovery

49

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Bibliotheek Der Rijksuniversiteit on 02/21/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions

1960b, 1961; Froeschels, 1921; Van Riper, 1982). In fact,
the total duration of disfluencies was similar to that
found by Zebrowski (1994) for school-age children who
stutter, providing more support for our suspicion that
little change is taking place in this parameter for several years after onset.
One of the most provocative observations was the
static nature of the persistent group's stuttering symptoms in light of the rapid language and motor development that takes place during this period. We are tempted
to hypothesize that in a substantial number of cases
the disturbed system causing stuttering remains quite
stable for at least the first 3 years after onset, suggesting that the role of learning during early stages of stuttering is more limited than what has often been assumed (Starkweather, 1997). Nevertheless, one cannot
ignore the fact that some children who persist eventually develop more severe problems. Whether this reflects
inherent characteristics that are slow to emerge or the
impact of increasing awareness and emotional reactions,
is a challenging question. The possibility that exposure
to clinical intervention may have contributed to the lack
of escalation of the disorder must also be considered.
But one must also recognize that these children continued to stutter in spite of treatment while, at the same
time, the recovered group improved without treatment.

Recovered Group
The fact that the recovered children began with considerably more disfluencies than the persistent group
could be the result of a sampling error. The decision to
include only recovered children who evidenced stuttering during at least two visits prior to recovery may have
increased the chance of more severe recovered participants being selected initially. The same tendency, however, has been observed in larger, unselected samples
(Yairi & Ambrose, 1999). Regardless, the findings show
that there is not a direct relation between the developmental outcome in stuttering and the initial level of
disfluency as measured in this study.
Generally, children in the recovered group, who did
not receive therapy, exhibited more changes in their
disfluencies than did the children in persistent group
who did receive therapy. The data indicate that recovery involves several dimensions. Not only is there a reduction in the number of disfluent events, there is also
reduction in the mean number of repetition units that,
by the post-recovery visit, fell within the normal range
(Yairi & Lewis, 1984). Additionally, there are changes
in the proportional composition of the types of disfluencies. As part-word repetition declines, monosyllabic
word repetition becomes relatively more prominent
whereas disrhythmic phonation all but disappears. The
present trend for slower repetition rate to be associated
50

with the normalization process in the recovered group,
although nonsignificant, should be further researched.

Clinical Implications and Conclusions
In general, the present data seem to indicate that
once stuttering begins, much of its development during
the first 3 years following onset takes the direction of
reduction and normalization, as well as some stabilization in the persistent children, rather than aggravation
of the condition. This conclusion is also supported by
the high rates of spontaneous recovery (Yairi & Ambrose,
1999). Aggravation does, of course, occur but it is the
less typical case. Even though awareness and emotional
reactions may be developing within the first 3 years of
stuttering onset, they do not seem to have a substantial
impact on the disfluent behavior of persistent children.
Based on the results of this study, it would appear
that current clinical notions and instruments concerning
predicting chronic stuttering need to be carefully reassessed. Perhaps they were formed on the basis of impressions derived from children who sustained stuttering
for longer periods, when their chronic status was closer to
being established. The present findings re-emphasize
the need for clinicians to observe clients over time.
Trends of decreasing frequency of disfluency, increasing
the proportion of monosyllabic word repetitions, decreasing the proportion of disrhythmic phonations, decreasing number of units in repetition, and increasing intervals within repetitions are all positive signs of recovery,
whereas lack or minimal change of disfluency is more
indicative of persistence (in contrast to previous suggestions of looking for an increase in severity).
In addition to replication of the current findings with
larger groups of children, further investigation into specific characteristics of part-word repetitions may be revealing. The early change from part- to whole-word repetition in the recovered group along with Stromsta's
(1965) observation that perhaps persistent stuttering is
characterized by fractured syllables, whereas transient
stuttering is characterized by whole syllable repetitions,
suggests the specific nature of the part-word repetitions
produced by these groups warrants further study.
