Purpose: In this study, the authors explore a method of measuring physiologic and
perceived stress in individuals with aphasia by investigating salivary cortisol reactivity
and subjectively perceived stress in response to a standardized linguistic task.
Method: Fifteen individuals with aphasia and 15 age-matched healthy controls
participated in a linguistic task involving speaking to an unfamiliar listener and a
nonlinguistic task consisting of the Mirror Drawing Test (Starch, 1910). Salivary
cortisol samples were taken following a 30-min baseline period, at the beginning and
end of each task, and at 10-min intervals throughout the posttask period. Perceptions
of stress also were assessed.
Results: No significant difference was found in cortisol levels over time within the
group with aphasia between the linguistic and nonlinguistic task; however, the control
group demonstrated greater cortisol reactivity during the linguistic task than during
the nonlinguistic task. For the linguistic task only, the control group demonstrated
greater cortisol reactivity than did the group with aphasia. Both groups perceived
greater stress posttask than pretask, although the aphasia group perceived greater
stress than did the control group.
Conclusion: Adults with aphasia perceived greater stress than did healthy controls;
however, this paradigm did not stimulate salivary cortisol reactivity in the aphasia
group. A potential reason for this may be differences in the type or degree of
psychosocial variables that are important in modulating stress in this population.
Other considerations when developing methods for assessing physiologic stress
include habituation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation
related to the neurological changes poststroke.

ndividuals with certain forms of aphasia may be under considerable
stress related to their difficulty with linguistic skills (Code, Hemsley,
& Herrmann, 1999; Heeschen, Ryalls, & Hagoort, 1988; Marshall &
Watts, 1976; Murray & Ray, 2001; Ryalls, 1984). There are numerous
observations of stress-related reactions such as anxiety, frustration, depression, and social isolation in the aphasia population (e.g., Gainotti,
1997; Sapir & Aronson, 1990; Starkstein & Robinson, 1988). Despite
these reports, the physiologic stress response associated with linguistic
tasks in a social context has not been systematically studied in individuals with aphasia.

The physiologic stress response provides a quantifiable means of measuring individuals' physiologic reactions to such stressors and avoids the methodological
problems of assessing perceptions of psychosocial dimensions in individuals with aphasia such as the lack
of standardized questionnaires or rating scales for this
population, as described by Herrmann (1997). This physiologic reaction may reflect subjective stressfulness of
linguistic demand. The current study is the first of a
series of studies developing a method of measuring physiologic and perceived stress in individuals with aphasia.
This study begins to explore potential stressors and salivary cortisol reactivity, which is a commonly used index
of the physiological stress response. Additionally, the
study examines the relation between cortisol response
and subjectively perceived stress.

Stress and Cortisol
Stress, as defined by Lazarus (1985), is generally
experienced when an individual is confronted with a
situation that is appraised as personally relevant and
threatening and for which adequate coping resources
are unavailable. Such stress elicits a physiological stress
response that serves to adapt the organism to the changing demand. More specifically, it is well documented
that psychological stress activates the hypothalamuspituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Kirschbaum, Pirke, &
Hellhammer, 1993). Following perception of a stressor,
the HPA axis is activated by the corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH), which is secreted from the median
eminence of the hypothalamus. CRH then stimulates
the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which then communicates with the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol (Bishop, 1994;
Sapolsky, 2002). Cortisol is a glucocorticoid circulating
in the human body; however, the level of cortisol increases in response to stressful or challenging situations. Cortisol secreted during stress allows for release of
glucose, which provides additional energy to physically
manage stressors. Cortisol also modulates immune and
behavioral responses to stress (McEwen, 1998). Changes
in perceptual thresholds, learning, memory, and mood
alterations are examples of behavioral responses related
to cortisol (deKloet, Joels, & Holsboer, 2005). Stress and
HPA axis activation are closely associated, although there
is documented evidence of stressed populations demonstrating reduced levels of cortisol ( Heim, Ehlert, &
Hellhammer, 2000).
The course of HPA axis activation during stressful
events includes an increase in CRH within a few seconds, an increase in ACTH within 15 seconds, and an
increase in cortisol within a longer time period. Cortisol
reactivity peaks 10 min after the cessation of stress, and
cortisol levels steadily return to baseline 90 min after

494

exposure to a discrete stressor (Kirschbaum et al., 1993).
To assess HPA axis responses to a given stressor, cortisol
may be collected via blood, urine, or saliva (Kirschbaum
& Hellhammer, 1994). The noninvasiveness and laboratory independence of sampling cortisol in saliva permits collection in a variety of field settings, thus making
it superior in ease of collection compared with gathering
blood or urine samples (Kirschbaum & Hellhammer, 1994;
Rosmond & Bjorntorp, 2000). Furthermore, salivary cortisol reflects the free and biologically active portion of
secreted cortisol. Salivary cortisol is regarded as a valid
and reliable index of adrenocortical stress responsiveness and is a valuable alternative to blood-borne cortisol analysis (Kirschbaum & Hellhammer, 1994). Cortisol
responses to laboratory stress are frequently used in
various fields that are concerned with biopsychological
mechanisms contributing to illnesses such as depression,
anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic pain syndromes, immune-related
disorders, asthma, atopic dermatitis, cardiovascular diseases, and functional gastrointestinal disorders, among
others.

Inducing Stress in Healthy Adults
Elevated levels of cortisol (hypercortisolemia) as a
potential consequence of prolonged or severe stress negatively affect the human body. Adverse effects of chronic
hypercortisolemia include reduction of dendritic branching and loss of dendritic spines in existing hippocampal neurons, in addition to impairment of neurogenesis
in the hippocampus ( Magarinos, Verdugo, & McEwen,
1997; Reul, Tonnaer, & deKloet, 1988; Sapolsky, Krey,
& McEwen, 1985). Hypercortisolemia may also result
in impairment of myocardial function and carbohydrate
metabolism (Seckl & Olsson, 1995) and influence immune responses and production of protein such as bone
and muscle ( Hillhouse, Kiecolt-Glaser, & Glaser, 1991;
McEwen & Stellar, 1993; Seeman, Singer, Rowe, &
McEwen, 2001). Additionally, altered levels of cortisol
are associated with depression and diabetes (Gold et al.,
1986; Halbreich, Asnis, Zumoff, Nathan, & Shindledecker,
1984; Sachar et al., 1973).
Interestingly, certain psychosocial variables that define stress experiences modulate the degree of physiological stress responses and can contribute to the existence of
hypercortisolemia in an otherwise healthy adult. Previous research indicates that situations characterized by
social-evaluative threat or ego involvement in which another person may potentially judge performance negatively are associated with HPA axis responsiveness.
Further, perceived lack of control or unpredictability in
a situation is associated with HPA axis responsiveness
(e.g., Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004; Gruenewald, Kemeny,
Aziz, & Fahey, 2004; Mason, 1968).

In the neurologically healthy population, several tasks
incorporating some of these psychosocial variables are
routinely used to evoke the stress response in a controlled laboratory setting. Researchers developed the
Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993)
and the Mirror Drawing Test (MDT; Starch, 1910) to
induce psychological stress in neurologically healthy individuals. When compared with other acute psychological
laboratory stressors (e.g., cognitive tasks, noise exposure,
or marital conflict interactions), the TSST has demonstrated the most robust physiological stress response
(Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). The TSST is a brief psychosocial stress protocol that includes a 10-min anticipation period and a 10-min test period. The task requires
participants to deliver a speech to an audience of 3 unfamiliar listeners who subsequently ask participants to
perform mental arithmetic. Participants are also told
that their nonverbal behavior will be analyzed. Saliva
samples are collected 30 min prior to the anticipation
period and 10 min thereafter for 90 min. Baseline cortisol levels dramatically increased following the task,
with peak levels occurring 10 min after cessation of stress
and a steady return to baseline occurring 90 min after the
start of the TSST (Kirschbaum et al., 1993).
Another laboratory-contrived stressor is the MDT,
which was originally developed by Starch (1910) for the
study of motor learning, but more recently, researchers
have used the test to induce stress in a controlled setting (Neumann, Arbogast, Chi, & Arbogast, 1992; Steptoe,
Evans, & Fieldman, 1997; Vogele & Steptoe, 1992;
Yoshiuchi et al., 1997). While surveying their performance in a mirror, participants trace a metal fivepointed-star shape with an electric probe. The mirror
reverses the image of the star. The electric probe is
connected to a counter that records the instances of the
probe going beyond the boundaries of the star (errors).
Each time an error occurs, a high-frequency beep sounds.
The counter records the total number of errors. Individuals performing this task have consistently demonstrated
increased blood pressure and heart rate (Steptoe et al.,
1997; Vogele & Steptoe, 1992; Yoshiuchi et al., 1997) and
changes in cortisol (Neumann et al., 1992).

Hypercortisolemia After Stroke
Hypercortisolemia following stroke is related to morbidity, mortality, and general stroke prognosis (Christensen,
Boysen, & Johannsen, 2004; Fassbender, Schmidt, Mossner,
Daffertshofer, & Hennerici, 1994; Feibel, Hardy, Campbell,
Goldstein, & Joynt, 1977; Marklund, Peltonen, Nilsson,
& Olsson, 2004; Murros, Fogelholm, Kettunen, & Vuorela,
1993; Olsson, 1990). Feibel et al. (1977) collected cortisol
during the acute stage from 65 patients with stroke or
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A neurologist rated
functional recovery of each patient 2-6 months after

their stroke or SAH. Results indicated that those with
hypercortisolemia during the acute stage had a higher
death rate and less functional recovery. Similarly, Olsson
(1990) studied 20 patients acutely poststroke, sampling
cortisol twice 1-5 days following admission. Poorer functional outcome was related to hypercortisolemia. More
recently, Christensen et al. (2004) found in a prospective
study of 172 patients with acute stroke that hypercortisolemia within the first 24 hr poststroke was negatively
related to stroke severity and death within 7 days after
stroke onset. The increased levels of cortisol acutely poststroke resulted from a dysregulation of the HPA axis.
This dysregulation may affect motor, cognitive, and behavioral function following stroke (Franceshini, Tenconi,
Zoppoli, & Barreca, 2001). Given the variety of consequences that a chronically activated HPA axis may have
on the human body, it is important to explore the HPA
axis in individuals with aphasia as they may be under
considerable stress and, thus, may be especially susceptible to the negative effects that can result from chronic
activation of the HPA axis.
As part of a larger study, Laures, Odell, and Coe
(2003) studied salivary cortisol levels in men with aphasia and healthy controls before and after linguistic and
nonlinguistic auditory vigilance tasks. The tasks required participants to identify a target sound among
pure tones or a target word among other words that were
highly abstract with a low frequency of occurrence. Each
vigilance task was 30 min in duration preceded by a
30-min resting period. Salivary cortisol samples were
taken after the resting period and after the experimental task. Although Laures et al. found that the group
with aphasia had higher overall levels of salivary cortisol during pre- and posttask measures than did healthy
controls during both vigilance tasks, the group with
aphasia did not demonstrate a change in cortisol levels
in response to the experimental tasks. The authors hypothesized that the lack of response to the tasks may
have been due to use of contrived vigilance tasks that were
not sufficiently challenging or threatening (Kirschbaum
et al., 1993). It is possible that tasks viewed as more challenging and containing social-evaluative threat or ego
involvement by individuals with aphasia may result in
increases in cortisol levels. Although it is known that
cortisol levels often increase after stroke, it appears that
little is known about cortisol reactivity to stressors in the
environment in stroke patients, specifically those with
chronic behavioral losses such as aphasia.
In an effort to determine the type of stimuli that
evokes a stress response as reflected by cortisol reactivity in individuals with aphasia, the current study includes two laboratory tasks: a linguistic task modeled
after the TSST and a nonlinguistic task (the MDT).
Both tasks follow the saliva-sampling schedule found
in the TSST due to the well-established finding that in

neurologically healthy individuals, cortisol peaks 10 min
after cessation of stress and returns to baseline 90 min
after the task is introduced (Kirschbaum et al., 1993).
The nonlinguistic task could be challenging for individuals with aphasia, given the compromised motor involvement following stroke. Individuals with aphasia
also may find the linguistic task challenging because of
the demand for speech, which is inherently challenging
as reflected by the general characteristics of many of
the different aphasia subtypes. Additionally, both tasks
may involve social-evaluative threat because of the recording of errors and verbal analysis.
The following research questions are addressed in
the current study: (a) What type of tasks invoke cortisol
reactivity in adults with aphasia and healthy controls?
(b) Does this cortisol reactivity differ between adults
with aphasia and healthy controls? (c) What types of
tasks increase the perception of stress in individuals
with aphasia?

Method
Participants
Participants with aphasia were recruited through
speech-language pathology departments in area hospitals. Control participants were recruited through flyers
and newspaper advertising. Initially, 18 individuals with
aphasia and 16 healthy controls participated. Data from
3 individuals from the aphasia group were discarded

because either there were negative findings for stroke on
the MRI or CT scans or the cortisol values were identified as outliers (greater than 2 SDs above the mean).
One individual from the control group did not complete
both tasks; thus, his data were discarded, as well. Therefore, 15 individuals with aphasia (3 women, 12 men) and
15 healthy controls (3 women, 12 men) between 41 and
71 years of age were included in the data analysis. Mean
age was 54.4 years (SD = 9.17) for individuals with
aphasia and 53.6 years (SD = 9.4) for the control group. A
t test revealed no significant difference in age between
aphasia and control groups (t = 0.27, p = .79). Four participants with aphasia were African American, and 11
were Caucasian. The control group consisted of agematched participants with a negative self-report history
of central nervous system disorders or communicationrelated disorders. Four control participants were African American, and 11 were Caucasian. All of the control
participants were either employed, self employed, or
full-time students. Descriptive data for individuals with
aphasia and control participants are listed in Tables 1
and 2.
Two participants from the control group and 2 participants from the group with aphasia were left-hand
dominant (prestroke). Handedness data for 1 participant
with aphasia was not available. Mean recovery time
from the cerebrovascular accident was 26.6 months.
Each individual with aphasia had a premorbid history
of normal speech and language as determined by self
or family report. Radiology reports confirmed that all of

the participants with aphasia had cerebrovascular accidents involving the left hemisphere as revealed by CT
or MRI. Participants with aphasia ranged from mild
to severe according to the Western Aphasia Battery
Aphasia Quotient (WAB AQ; Kertesz, 1982). Aphasia
type was determined by WAB subtests. In addition to
the aphasia, 8 participants demonstrated a mild or moderate form of apraxia of speech, as measured by the
Apraxia Battery for Adults-2 (Dabul, 2000). No participants exhibited dysarthria according to the Frenchay
Dysarthria Assessment (Enderby, 1983).
No individuals taking corticosteroid medications
were included in the study because of the effect of corticosteroid medications on cortisol production. One female
participant in the aphasia group was taking Premarin, a
drug associated with estrogen, and 2 other participants
with aphasia reported taking medications for diabetes
that may influence cortisol levels. Two aphasia participants' self-reports were positive for a current diagnosis
of depression. Participants were paid an hourly rate for
their time.

Stimuli
Linguistic task. The TSST includes a 5-min free
speech task in which each participant is told to take the
role of job applicant and convince 3 unfamiliar listeners
that he or she is the best applicant for the position. Each
participant is given 10 min to prepare his or her talk.
The participant then speaks for 5 min. If participants
finish before 5 min, they are told that they still have time
left and should continue. If this happens a second time,
the listeners ask prepared questions. After 5 min, participants are told to serially subtract 13 from 1,022 quickly
and accurately. If the participant errs, he or she must
begin again. This continues for 5 min (Kirschbaum et al.,

1993). The stimulus in the current study was similar to
the TSST, but we modified it to reflect a more authentic
scenario in which an individual with aphasia must speak
about himself or herself to another person. To avoid the
confound of stress caused by multiple listeners, the current study included only 1 unfamiliar listener. The listener told each participant with aphasia that he would be
speaking for 5 min about his occupation before his stroke.
Control participants were asked to talk about their current job or their occupation prior to retirement. This
would be followed by questions for 5 min. Participants
were told that their speech would be audiotaped and
analyzed. Participants were given 10 min to prepare before their speech. If participants finished before 5 min,
they were told that they still had time left. In contrast to
the original TSST, an arithmetic exercise was not included in the present linguistic task. See Appendix A for
complete instructions to the participants with aphasia
and Appendix B for instructions to the healthy control
participants.
Nonlinguistic task. Participants completed the MDT,
as described earlier. Each participant was told to use his
or her nonparetic or nondominant hand to complete the
task. We included this request (a) to avoid stroke participants not being able to complete the task because of
paresis and (b) to provide motor challenge for the healthy
control participants. Participants were told that mistakes
would be recorded and that the number of mistakes would
be reviewed. See Appendix C for complete instructions.

Measures
Cortisol sampling. For cortisol determination, saliva
samples were obtained by having the participant chew
on a Salivette (Sarstedt, Rommelsdorf, Germany) for
1 min. A Salivette is a commercially available device that
provides hygienic collection (Hellhammer, Kirschbaum,
& Belkien, 1987). Samples were collected at the beginning and end of the 30-min baseline period and then at
10-min intervals for 90 min. Each Salivette was placed
in a plastic vial, was number coded and time coded for
each participant, was frozen at -60 C, and was later
analyzed by radioimmunoassay (Yerkes Primate Laboratory, Atlanta, Georgia) using a commercially prepared kit produced by Diagnostics Systems Laboratories
(Webster, TX).
Perception of stress. At the end of the 30-min baseline
period and at the end of the linguistic and nonlinguistic
tasks, each participant completed a scaling of current
stress. Each participant was asked to rate, on a scale
of 1-7, how stressed he or she felt at that moment (1 =
calm, 7 = stressed). A visual analog consisting of a facial
expression reflecting "relaxed" and "stressed" anchored
both ends of the scale. There are no available measures of perceived stress that have been validated with

individuals with aphasia. The current scale was developed by the first author and was used because the linguistic demand is relatively minimal.

Procedures and Experimental Design
Participants were aware of the purpose of the experiment, and a general description of the tasks was provided during the consent procedure. Participants were
instructed to avoid ingestion of nicotine, caffeine, alcohol,
or food 2 hr prior to testing. Both groups participated in
three sessions. All individuals consented to the study and
underwent language, cognitive, and motor testing during
the initial session. Motor testing was included because
of the fine motor demands of the MDT. Assessment of
motor skills was accomplished by having all participants
complete a sequential finger-tapping task that is commonly used for measuring fine motor skills. This task
required each participant to tap a lever as quickly as
possible with the index finger of the right and the index
finger of the left hand. Participants began with the right
index finger and tapped for 1 min then alternated to the
left index finger. This occurred until both the right and
left index finger had five 1-min tapping trials. A counter
connected to the lever recorded the number of taps per
trial. The average number of taps for each index finger
was recorded for analysis. Five individuals in the group
with aphasia were unable to complete the tapping task
with the right index finger because of paresis.
The second and third sessions were the experimental sessions, and each session consisted of either the linguistic or nonlinguistic tasks. Both experimental sessions
occurred for 2 hr between 1:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. to control for diurnal fluctuation of cortisol levels. Order of
task presentation was counterbalanced across participants. The second and third sessions took place within a
2-week period.
Linguistic task. Each participant arrived for the experimental session and rested in a quiet room (Room A)
during a 30-min baseline period. Participants were instructed by the primary examiner to quietly relax. After
30 min, the participant provided a saliva sample. The
participant was then taken to a second room (Room B)
by the primary examiner and was introduced to the task.
Upon entering Room B, the participant encountered an
unfamiliar listener sitting behind a table, wearing a
white lab coat, and holding a notepad and pen. An audiotape recorder was placed on the table. An empty chair
was placed directly across from the listener. The participant remained standing or sitting in his wheelchair
while listening to the instructions. The instructions were
repeated if the participant did not understand the procedure. The participant was then led back to Room A by
the primary examiner for a 10-min anticipatory period

498

in which he or she, again, was instructed to sit quietly.
Following the anticipatory period, the participant provided a saliva sample and then was led back into Room B.
At this time, the participant sat across from the listener.
The listener turned on the audiotape recorder. The listener again stated, "You will be speaking for 5 min about
your occupation before your stroke. Then I will ask you a
few questions for 5 min. So, begin telling me about your
occupation." If the participant did not speak for 5 min, the
listener prompted the participant by stating, " You still
have time left." In five cases, deviations from the 5-min
speech occurred in that the listener asked unscripted questions to elicit some speech from those with aphasia.
Following the 5-min speech, the listener asked a premade

listener did not provide any visual or verbal feedback and

Nonlinguistic task. Each participant arrived for the
experimental session and rested in a quiet room (Room A)
during a 30-min baseline period. Participants were instructed by the primary examiner to quietly relax. After
30 min, the participant provided a saliva sample. The
participant was then taken to a second room (Room B)
by the primary examiner and was introduced to the task.
Upon entering Room B, the participant encountered a
second examiner wearing a white lab coat and sitting
at a small table. This examiner was not involved in the
linguistic task. She provided verbal instructions and a
visual demonstration of the task. The participant remained standing or sitting in his or her wheelchair
while listening to the instructions. The instructions and
demonstration were repeated if the participant did not
understand the procedure. The participant was then led
back to Room A by the primary examiner for a 10-min
anticipatory period in which he or she, again, was instructed to sit quietly. Following the anticipatory period,
the participant provided a saliva sample and then was
led back into Room B to perform the task. The second
examiner provided no verbal or visual feedback throughout the task. After 10 min of performing this task, the
participant was stopped by the primary examiner and
returned to Room A. See Figure 1 for a visual of the sampling schedule for each task and the experimental design.
Both the schedule and movement of participants from
Room A to Room B followed the original TSST protocol.

Results
Salivary Cortisol
See Figure 2 and Table 3 for mean cortisol reactivity
over time. To answer the stated research questions,
repeated-measures ANOVAs analyzing Task x Time
(within group) and Group x Time (within task) were
used. Within the aphasia group, a significant main effect
for time was found, F(1, 245) = 41.5, p = .00, d = 2.43,
indicating that within this group, cortisol concentrations
changed over time. However, a nonsignificant main effect for task, F(1, 245) = .01, p = .93, was found, showing
that the aphasia group demonstrated similar cortisol
concentrations between the linguistic and nonlinguistic
task. A nonsignificant Time x Task interaction was
found in the aphasia group, F(1, 245) = .42, p = .52.
Within the control group, there was a significant main
effect for time, F(1, 246) =10.56, p = .00, d = 1.23, but
not for task, F(1, 246) = .01, p = .94. A significant Time x
Task interaction within the control group was found,
F(1,246) = .5.11, p = .03, d = 0.85, indicating that the
control group had different cortisol concentrations over
time between the linguistic and nonlinguistic task.
Within the linguistic task, there was not a significant
main effect for group, F(1, 232) = .03, p = .87; however, a
significant main effect for time was found, F(1, 232) =
13.16, p = .94, d = 1.37. A significant Group x Time
interaction was discovered within the linguistic task,
F(1, 232) = .5.09, p = .03, d = .85, indicating that the
two groups did demonstrate different cortisol concentrations during the linguistic task. A review of Figure 2
shows that the control group had significantly greater
reactivity than did the aphasia group. Within the nonlinguistic task, a nonsignificant group main effect was
found, F(1, 231) = .11, p = .74; however, a significant time
main effect was found, F(1, 231) = 59.24, p = .00, d = 2.91.
This suggests that cortisol concentrations did change
over time, but the two groups reacted similarly. Finally,
a nonsignificant group x Time interaction was found,
F(1, 231) = .00, p = .99, indicating that the two groups
reacted similarly during the nonlinguistic task.

and within each task (Group x Time). Analysis was completed using SAS (Version 8.2), a = .05. We used Pearson's
correlations to explore the relation between cortisol and
the variables of WAB AQ, motor fluency, and number of
errors during the MDT. We used Wilcoxon signed-ranks

Overall, the results indicate that the slopes of the
cortisol responses with respect to time are different between aphasia and control groups during the linguistic
task only. Cortisol reactivity during both tasks in the group
with aphasia decreased linearly with time, whereas that
decrease was not observed in the control group. To test
whether the aphasia group had higher levels of cortisol

analysis was conducted with simple t tests on values
at -30 min. The cortisol levels of the two groups did not
differ prior to each task ( linguistic, t = 0.75, p = .46; nonlinguistic, t = 0.68, p = .50). In summary, cortisol reactivity did differ between adults with aphasia and healthy
controls, but, in contrast to expectations, neither task
elicited cortisol reactivity in the aphasia group.

comparison data for perception of stress (pre- and posttask
scaling) revealed significant differences pre- and posttask for each group, suggesting that both groups perceived greater stress after the tasks than before the tasks
(aphasia group: linguistic [W = -39, p = .00], nonlinguistic
[ W = -39, p = .00]; control group: linguistic [ W = -25,
p = .05), nonlinguistic ( W = -33, p = .00]). The aphasia
group perceived greater stress than did the control group
after the linguistic task ( W = .31, p = .00). The aphasia
group did not perceive greater stress than did the control
group after the nonlinguistic task ( W = .26, p = .30).

Discussion
In the current study, we assessed a method of studying stress in individuals with left-hemisphere stroke
and aphasia by exploring the types of tasks that invoke
cortisol reactivity in adults with aphasia and in healthy
controls and whether this cortisol reactivity differs between adults with aphasia and healthy controls. Additionally, we investigated whether these tasks were effective in
changing the perception of stress in adults with aphasia.
Salivary cortisol reactivity was measured following participation in a linguistic task modeled after the TSST and
a nonlinguistic task (the MDT). Perceptions of stress were
scaled before and after each task. Overall, the group with
aphasia did not respond differently between the linguistic
and nonlinguistic tasks; however, the control group did.
Unlike the control group, the aphasia group did not exhibit higher salivary cortisol levels following the linguistic
task. Neither group demonstrated a stress response as
measured by cortisol reactivity to the MDT. Although the
aphasia group did report greater perceived stress after the
linguistic task than did the control group, salivary cortisol
did not respond to this perceived stress. Additionally, the
5 participants with aphasia who required prompts during
the linguistic task were judged to have not demonstrated
lower cortisol concentrations than the other participants
with aphasia. Therefore, this subset of the aphasia group
should not have contributed to the lack of significant cortisol reactivity following the linguistic task. Similar to
Laures et al. (2003), the current paradigm was insufficient
in stimulating salivary cortisol in individuals with aphasia.
The MDT was not effective in eliciting a cortisol response in either group. In fact, both groups displayed
decreases in cortisol levels following the task. A possible
explanation for the lack of response to the MDT for both
groups is that this task did not possess an adequate

degree of social-evaluative threat or ego involvement, two
variables that are highly associated with large increases
in cortisol. Participants also may have felt a sense of
control because the MDT was predictable and repetitive.
Although Neumann et al. (1992) showed an increase in
cortisol after the MDT in their participants while investigating stress reactivity and blood type, Yoshiuchi et al.
(1997) did not find a change in cortisol after the MDT in
their hypertensive participants. This suggests that the
MDT effectively activates the HPA axis in only certain
populations. However, alterations in blood pressure and
heart rate are consistently seen following participation
with the MDT (Steptoe et al., 1997; Vogele & Steptoe,
1992). In the current experiment, we only used a neuroendocrine measure in response to the MDT; therefore,
changes in other physiological stress response systems
in this sample are unknown. Because cardiovascular
reactivity is another measure of the stress response
stemming from sympathetic nervous system activation
(Sapolsky, 2002), future studies should examine the suitability of cardiovascular measures in assessing stress in
the aphasia population.
The psychosocial variables or the degree of intensity for those variables to modulate cortisol reactivity in
individuals with aphasia may be different than those
variables found to induce stress in individuals who are
non-neurologically impaired. A measurable change in
stress response was obtained on the linguistic task, which
involved speaking to another person, when compared with
the nonlinguistic task in the control group. This result
is similar to the results of the TSST ( Kirschbaum et al.,
1993), in which their healthy participants did demonstrate increases in salivary cortisol in response to the
speaking task included in that study. It appears that the
modifications made to the TSST, in an attempt to reflect
a more natural communication context for individuals
with aphasia, continued to possess the psychosocial variables that modulate cortisol reactivity in individuals
who are non-neurologically impaired. Despite this, the
linguistic task did not elicit a cortisol response in the
group with aphasia. The lack of cortisol reactivity to this
task was similar to that found following the MDT. When
evaluating the ineffectiveness of this task at stimulating
salivary cortisol in the aphasia group, one should consider the variables associated with the stimuli and the
use of cortisol to measure stress in individuals poststroke. Additionally, one should perform neuroendocrine
pharmacological challenges to determine whether there
is an inherent HPA axis problem in these participants
rather than solely insufficiency of the task.
While examining stimuli that may induce stress in
individuals with aphasia, the possibility of habituation
to repetitive stressors should be considered. It is possible that the conditions in this experiment are familiar

to individuals with aphasia. Often, as part of the clinical
experience related to rehabilitation, those with aphasia
are tape recorded, and their speech is analyzed. Additionally, because of frequent breakdowns in communication, those with aphasia become accustomed to negative
consequences associated with speaking. Evidence of hypocortisolism, a deficiency of cortisol involving reduced HPA
axis reactivity or low baseline levels, has been found in
individuals living in stressful conditions or experiencing
a traumatic event (for a review, see Heim et al., 2000).
Additionally, Yehuda, Giller, Southwick, Lowy, and Mason
(1991) reviewed their findings from animal models of
chronic stress and observed that as animals are repeatedly exposed to the same stressor, a habituation of the
HPA axis stress response ensues.
The phenomenon of hypocortisolism is an emerging
construct in the field of stress research. Traditionally,
stress has been associated with activation of the HPA
axis, resulting in increased production of cortisol. However, a rapidly growing body of literature, which has
accumulated over the years, provides compelling evidence that the HPA axis might be hypoactive in a wide
range of mental and physical disorders that are related
to stress ( Fries, Hesse, Hellhammer, & Hellhammer, 2005;
Heim et al., 2000). Although it appears that hypocortisolism is a frequent and widespread phenomenon, its
precise definition, measurement, and epidemiology, as
well as its underlying mechanisms and physiological relevance, have not been systematically explored. Related to
the findings of the current study, neuronal pathology
related to stroke might underlie lack of cortisol response,
which would be a different phenomenon from the findings
of stress-related hypocortisolism in functional disorders.
Clearly, the finding of decreased cortisol response in
these patients needs further research--that is, assessing
potentially altered dynamics of the HPA axis using pharmacological challenge.
The validity of using cortisol as a measure of stress
in the neurologically impaired should also be explored.
The participants in this study subjectively perceived
greater stress following the linguistic task and the MDT
than before the tasks (as measured by the rating scale)
without a cortisol reaction. It is known that a dysregulation of the HPA axis occurs immediately following a
stroke ( Fassbender et al., 1994; Franceshini et al., 2001;
Johansson, Ahren, Nasman, Carlstrom, & Olsson, 2000;
Olsson, 1990). However, long-term functioning, specifically reactivity following acute stressors, of the HPA axis
following stroke has not been explored. It is possible that
cortisol reactivity and cortisol recovery in individuals
poststroke and with aphasia do not follow the same
pattern, as Kirschbaum et al. (1993) found in their neurologically healthy participants. Individuals with aphasia in the current study may have reacted quicker and
demonstrated quicker recovery, but the 10-min intervals

of cortisol sampling were too long to reveal this. Further
exploration of designs for assessment of cortisol reactivity in stroke patients is needed.
Certain patient variables other than stroke that have
been linked to HPA axis dysregulation should also be
considered. For example, this study did not exclude individuals with diabetes or depression, both of which may
affect HPA axis functioning (Gold et al., 1986; Halbreich
et al., 1984; Sachar et al., 1973). Because the occurrence of
depression and diabetes is not uncommon in individuals
who have had a stroke, exclusion of such participants may
be unrealistic. The contrast group could be matched to the
group with aphasia for such confounds. Additionally, differences in cortisol levels between the sexes have been
reported (Kirschbaum, Kudielka, Gaab, Schommer, &
Hellhammer, 1999). Such patient variables could be considered with statistical designs, as well. However, in the
current study, those participants with diabetes and depression were not outliers in salivary cortisol reactivity,
although the sample size was rather small for identification of outliers and anomalous data.
Overall, the present study initiated a promising exploration of potential stressors, salivary cortisol reactivity, and subjectively perceived stress in individuals with
left-hemisphere stroke and aphasia. Future studies should
continue to explore the type of psychosocial variables and
stimuli important in inducing stress in individuals with
aphasia. Also, studies should broaden investigation of the
HPA axis by including poststroke patients in general
(right- and left-hemisphere stroke) and should attempt
to assess the impact of behavioral losses such as aphasia
on the reactivity of the HPA axis. Additionally, the standardized HPA axis challenge tests or pharmacological
challenges should be used for evaluation of whether
there are functional impairments at different levels of the
HPA axis, such as central CRF hypoactivity, pituitary or
adrenal insufficiency, or altered negative feedback sensitivity (Heim et al., 2000). Further inquiry is also needed
regarding the use of other measures for assessment of
physiologic stress as well as patient variables such as
depression and diabetes and their effect on physiologic
measures in individuals with aphasia.

Appendix A. Instructions for linguistic task (individuals with aphasia).
The participant will be guided into Room B. The listener will be seated wearing a lab coat and holding
a notepad and pen. An audiotape recorder will be placed on the table where listener is seated.
The listener will state, "You will be speaking for 5 minutes about your occupation before your stroke.
Then I will ask you a few questions for 5 minutes. Do you have any questions?"
The participant will return to Room A for 10 minutes for the anticipatory period. At 10 minutes,
the participant will return to Room B. The participant will sit across from the listener. The listener
will turn on the audio recorder. The listener will again state, "You will be speaking for 5 minutes
about your occupation before your stroke. Then I will ask you a few questions for 5 minutes. So, begin
telling me about your occupation."
If the participant does not speak for 5 minutes, prompt participant by stating, "You still have time left."
Continue this until 5 minutes are completed.
After 5 minutes of free discourse, stop the participant. Begin to ask questions. Follow the guide below
for questions:
What do you miss most about your job?
How do you fill your time now? What are your hobbies?
Do you have regrets about your job? If so, what are they?
Were you able to spend time with your family or did your job take a lot of time?
What activities do you enjoy doing with your family now?
Tell me a little about your family.
If further time is available, you can elaborate on any information provided previously. You must ask
open-ended questions that are linguistically simple and short.
