Abstract Prepositional phrase attachment was investigated in temporarily ambiguous sentences. Both attachment site (noun phrase or verb phrase) and argument
status (argument or adjunct) were manipulated to test the hypothesis that arguments
are processed differently than adjuncts. Contrary to this hypothesis, some previous
research suggested that arguments and adjuncts are initially processed in the same
manner, following a general bias to attach prepositional phrases to the verb phrase
whenever possible [Clifton, Speer, & Abney (1991) Journal of Memory and Language,
30, 251-271]. The current study supports the hypothesis for differential processing,
even during the initial stages of syntactic analysis. In an eye movement experiment,
readers spent less first-pass time on argument prepositional phrases (PPs) than adjunct
PPs. The results support a view in which a noun's or verb's argument structure can
facilitate the analysis of its arguments.

Introduction
The interface between lexical and syntactic processing is a central issue in current
theories of sentence processing, and the distinction between arguments and adjuncts

lies at the heart of the debate. In brief, arguments and adjuncts are dependent phrases
that are embedded within a larger constitutent, such as a noun phrase (NP) or verb
phrase (VP). While arguments serve as fundamental participants within those larger
phrases, adjuncts do not. Some approaches maintain that both argument and adjunct
attachment sites (as well as most other syntactic knowledge) are stored lexically (e.g.,
MacDonald, Pearlmutter, & Seidenberg, 1994; Trueswell, Tanenhaus, & Garnsey,
1994). Other approaches maintain a strict division between global and lexical syntactic knowledge (e.g., Ferreira & Henderson, 1990; Frazier, 1987; Mitchell, 1989). The
first approach makes predictions about processing difficulty based on lexical preferences (e.g., How frequently does sent occur with an indirect object?). The second
approach posits a privileged role for globally represented syntactic knowledge and
therefore predicts broad structural preferences, such as that embodied by minimal
attachment (Frazier, 1978). Intermediate positions are also possible; for example,
arguments might be represented lexically, but not adjuncts (e.g., Boland & BoehmJernigan, 1998).
The argument/adjunct distinction is important in many linguistic theories, although
there is disagreement as to whether the argument/adjunct distinction is binary or
even categorical (e.g., Grimshaw, 1990; Kegl & Fellbaum, 1988). Within theories that
maintain a distinction between arguments and adjuncts, only arguments are lexically
specified by their heads. At a minimum, the lexical representation of the head includes
a subcategorization frame that marks the syntactic category of each argument. For
example, sent can subcategorize for a direct object NP and an indirect object prepositional phrase (PP). The semantic content of an argument is limited by selectional
restrictions and by thematic role assignments made by the head. Thus, the semantic
contribution of an argument depends in part on the particular head with which it is
associated. For example, in The bully sent a threatening letter to Harry, the interpretation of Harry as a recipient depends upon the dative verb. When the verb does not
subcategorize for a to-PP, Harry is interpreted as merely a location (e.g., The bully
stapled a threatening letter to Harry).
In contrast, adjuncts are traditionally not subcategorized for by lexical heads. An
adjunct can appear after a wide range of heads while maintaining a consistent semantic contribution across those heads. For example, during the night will have the same
meaning following either sent or stapled. Furthermore, a similar contribution could
be made by dependent phrases of several other syntactic types (e.g., NP: this evening;
Adverb:recently). In (1), the PP to his son is an argument because a giving event must
specify a recipient. The head (gave) specifies both the syntactic category of this phrase
and the thematic role assigned by the preposition to (recipient). During the afternoon,
however, is an adjunct because time is not central to the event denoted by the verb.
If the afternoon receives a thematic role in (1), it is assigned by the preposition during.

John gave a letter to his son during the afternoon.

Syntactic categories other than verbs may also take arguments and adjuncts. For
example, in (1), the afternoon is an argument of the preposition during. In (2), for
lobsters is an argument of the noun fondness, while from Maine is an adjunct of the
noun lobsters.

Her fondness for lobsters from Maine was obvious.

The argument/adjunct distinction may have a structural component. For theories
that use an X-bar framework, there are different attachment sites for the two types

of phrases (Chomsky, 1986, 1995; Jackendoff, 1977). As shown in Fig. 1, arguments
are attached as sisters to the heads that subcategorize for them, whereas adjuncts are
attached as sisters to the intermediate phrasal category that the head projects. However, such a structural distinction is not universally accepted. Argument and adjunct
attachments are not differentiated in the strictly binary branching structures of Pesetsky's Layered Syntax (1995), in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG;
Pollard & Sag, 1994), and in Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman,
1996). In the latter two approaches, arguments are characterized as phrases that are
selected by heads, while adjuncts are characterized as phrases that select heads.
Despite the linguistic debate, hypotheses about the representation and processing
of arguments and adjuncts feature prominently in many psycholinguistic proposals
(Abney, 1989; Boland & Boehm-Jernigan, 1998; Boland & Lewis, 1998; Frazier &
Clifton, 1996; Schutze & Gibson, 1999; Stevenson, 1998). For example, MacDonald et
al. (1994) argued that all phrases, not just those typically considered to be arguments,
are lexically specified by their heads. Under this account, phrases that are classified as
arguments in other models simply occur more frequently with their heads than phrases
that are traditionally classified as adjuncts. As a result, "arguments" are more strongly
represented in the lexical entries of the relevant heads, but have the same syntactic and
semantic status as "adjuncts." We'll call this the Pure Frequency Hypothesis, or PFH.
MacDonald et al. advocated a highly lexicalized mode of parsing, in which structural
fragments are accessed during word recognition and joined together to form sentence
structure. For example, upon hearing John gave, all the argument/adjunct structures
associated with gave would be accessed, with the more frequent argument/adjunct
structures more strongly available. The PFH predicts that direct and indirect object
arguments will be attached more easily than locative and temporal adjuncts, simply
because the arguments co-occur with gave more frequently and are, therefore, more
strongly weighted among the possible argument/adjunct structures.
In contrast, Boland and Boehm-Jernigan (1998) proposed that argument and
adjunct PPs are attached via different mechanisms. In their proposal, argument
attachment sites are processed just as in the PFH: they are generated during lexical access, and ease of argument attachment is mediated by the relative frequencies of ranked, competing verb forms (the competitors of moved include [Vpast ],
[Vpast <NP>], [Vpast <NP PP>], and [Vpastparticiple ]). But contrary to the PFH,
adjunct attachment sites are not lexically represented, and adjunct attachments must

388

therefore be accomplished via non-lexicalized syntactic rules. We call this the
Argument Structure Hypothesis, or ASH.
ASH predicts argument/adjunct differences at the earliest stage of processing.
Consider the examples in (3). Let us assume that offered lexically specifies a PP-to
recipient as an argument and exemptions lexically specifies a PP-from source argument.
Upon hearing The agency offered..., a prepositional dative structure <NP-theme PPto-recipient> would be made available, along with a double object structure <NPrecipient NP-theme> and any other structures associated with offered. The availability
of each structure is initially a function of its frequency for that lexical item. Thus, if the
prepositional dative is a frequent form, it would be strongly available. The next NP,
some exemptions, would be easily incorporated with this prepositional dative structure, as would the preposition to in (3a). At the same time, grammatical rules would
postulate options in which to heads a NP-attached PP adjunct and a VP-attached PP
adjunct, but these options would not be activated as strongly as the prepositional
dative. Upon recognition of exemptions, a < PP-from > frame would have been activated, and it would be supported by the preposition from in (3b) and (3c), but it would
not have been supported by the prepositions in (3a) or (3d).
(3)

The agency offered some exemptions ...
a. ...to the business (VP argument)
b. ...from the start (VP adjunct)
c. ...from the rules (NP argument)
d. ...over ten dollars (NP adjunct)

Frazier and Clifton (1996) made almost the opposite proposal from ASH. They suggested that "primary" phrases (essentially arguments and their heads) are analyzed
using global structural principles, such as minimal attachment, while adjuncts are
"associated" using detailed lexical information and real world knowledge. Because
phrases that might or might not be primary are first analyzed as primary phrases,
argument/adjunct differences would not be predicted in the initial analysis of the
PPs investigated here; Frazier and Clifton explicitly claimed that PPs in V-NP-PP
constructions are initially minimally attached to the VP.
Some experimental research seems to support the minimal attachment view. Clifton, Speer, and Abney (1991) (See also Speer & Clifton, 1998) manipulated attachment site and argument status as shown in (4), with the attachment site boldfaced.
VP-attached PPs were read faster than NP-attached PPs, but argument status had
no effect until the region after the PP, where argument conditions were faster than
adjunct conditions. Clifton et al. suggested that a PP is initially attached to the VP
(as an argument) using a minimal attachment strategy. When detailed lexical information was consulted to check the attachments, adjuncts and NP arguments had to
be reanalyzed, causing the late effect of argument status.

There are several reasons to be cautious in adopting this conclusion. First, only 12
of their 16 items passed tests for argument status (Schutze & Gibson, 1999), and some
of those 12 seem like borderline arguments to us. Examples include arranged the ceremony with a minister, disgusted the woman with his dirty diapers, tapped his cane on the

door, and vaccinated the young Americans for the flu in the VP argument stimuli, and
arrangements with a minister, disgust with a dirty baby, andtap on the door in the NP
argument stimuli. Second, the argument-assigning verbs (interest in [4a]) used in their
experiment occur most frequently as past participles (76%), rather than as simple past
tense verbs (24%; See Table 1). This is relevant because the two verb forms select
different arguments and assign different thematic roles.1 If an argument attachment
is affected by the frequency of the lexical structure that provides that attachment
site, one is unlikely to find an advantage for arguments over adjuncts unless one uses
verbs and nouns that frequently select the arguments being investigated. Clifton et
al.'s failure to find early effects of argument status may have been because lexical
competitors (i.e., past participle forms) were more strongly available than the needed
form [Vpast <NP PP>]. Third, Clifton et al. (1991) embedded their VP argument and
NP adjunct PPs in infinitive clauses, constructions that are syntactically more complex
than those containing the VP adjunct and NP argument PPs. Lastly, other researchers
have found effects of argument status (e.g., Britt, 1994; Schutze & Gibson, 1999).

Normative Studies
We compared the processing of VP- and NP-attached arguments and adjuncts in a
two-by-two factorial design, using sentences like those in (5). Our materials differed
from Clifton et al.'s (1991) in several respects. First, a corpus search conducted on our
verbs demonstrated that the past participle forms were not more frequent than the
simple past forms. This change was implemented to insure that the [Vpast <NP PP>]
form of the verbs was at least as accessible as the past participle form. Both the verbs
and direct object nouns in our materials frequently selected their PP arguments, and
normative data demonstrated that even though our argument and adjunct PPs were
equally plausible, the argument PPs were preferred. Second, most of our verbs were
chosen from Levin's (1993) dative classes, and our noun and verb arguments passed
a battery of linguistic tests for argument status, as in Schutze and Gibson (1999). Our
VP adjuncts functioned as adverbs, most commonly expressing temporal information,
and our NP adjuncts frequently expressed location or other descriptive information.

Corpus Analyzes
We used both the Brown and the parsed Wall Street Journal (WSJ) databases in
the Penn Treebank corpora to conduct several normative analyzes. First, we estimated the frequency of the past participle forms, relative to simple past tense forms,
for verbs in our own materials and in the materials from three other studies, We
1 For example, in the simple past form (The woman interested Chris), interest assigns the role of theme
(object of interest) to its subject and the role of patient (affected participant) to its direct object. In
the past participle form (The woman interested in Chris left), woman and Chris have swapped roles,
and the syntactic properties of interest's arguments have changed also. The subject of interested is an
empty category co-indexed with woman, and the post-verb entity is in a PP rather than a NP.

searched on the orthographic string for each verb and calculated the proportion of
past participles out of the total number of simple past and past participle forms. The
results are summarized in Table 1. In our study, we use the same verb across conditions within each item, while Clifton et al. (1991) used different verbs within items
for the VP argument and VP adjunct conditions.2 There was a higher proportion of
past participles in Clifton et al.'s argument assigning verbs compared to our verbs
[t(29) = 3.43, p < 0.01],3 which were comparable to Clifton et al. non-argument
assigning verbs. In fact, for the verbs in the Clifton et al. VP argument condition, the
past participle forms were about three times more frequent than the simple past tense
forms. Thus, it is not surprising that the effects of argument status were seen late in
the Clifton et al. study. With less interference from the participle forms in the current
experiment, however, we expect argument effects to dominate attachment site in the
early measures. In our materials, the proportions of past participle forms are comparable to those for the critical verbs from Schutze and Gibson (1999) and Britt (1994)
[ts < 0.8, p > 0.10], who each found a privileged role for the processing of arguments.
Second, we estimated the frequency with which our verbs and direct object nouns
are used with argument and adjunct PPs of the type used in our study. We searched
each corpus on the orthographic string for each verb and counted tokens that were
exact matches to our materials. Then we searched for each direct object noun and
again counted only exact matches. For both verbs and nouns, if there were more than
200 matches, we used the first 200 tokens. We omitted one noun (tattoos) and five verbs
(withheld, concealed, hid, mailed, and communicated) from further analysis because
each resulted in fewer than six matches. For each set of verb and noun tokens, we
examined tokens that were modified by a PP and calculated the probability of an argument or adjunct PP of the same type used in our critical stimuli. We classified PP types
in two ways. First, for each verb and noun, we calculated the proportion of tokens that
were modified by a PP having the same participatory role (e.g., marking the recipient,
location, or time) as the argument or adjunct PP in our critical materials. Next, we
calculated the proportion of tokens with PPs of the same preposition as our argument
or adjunct PP. To obtain the most stable estimate of argument/adjunct frequency, we

J Psycholinguist Res (2006) 35:385-403

combined the data from the Brown and WSJ corpora by summing the raw counts for
a given item before calculating the proportion of singular nouns and simple past tense
verbs that occurred with argument and adjunct PPs having the same role and/or the
same preposition as our target PPs. These data are summarized in Appendix A.
We submitted each of three variables in Appendix A to a 2 (verb or noun) x 2
(argument or adjunct) Analyzes of Variance (ANOVA). The frequency of the head
was not affected by either head type or argument status, although after undergoing a
log transform, the frequencies were reliably higher for verbs than nouns [F2(1, 29) =
4.89, p < 0.05]. The proportion of PPs with the same role was higher for nouns compared to verbs [F2(1, 29) = 8.57, p < 0.01] and higher for arguments compared to
adjuncts [F2(1, 29) = 21.24, p < 0.01]. The two variables also interacted [F2(1, 29) =
5.02, p < 0.05]; the highest proportion of PPs with the same role were in the noun argument condition. When considering the proportion of PPs by preposition, the results
were the same. There were main effects of head type [F2(1, 29) = 6.52, p < 0.05] and
argument status [F2(1, 29) = 23.64, p < 0.01], and an interaction between the two
[F2(1, 29) = 6.69, p < 0.05].
Forced-choice Judgments
We collected forced-choice judgments to determine how strongly readers prefer to
have an explicit PP argument for each verb and noun in our study. For each critical
item, the VP + PP argument and NP + PP argument fragments were paired with PP
argumentless fragments using the same noun or verb. The examples in (6) and (7) list
the argument fragments first. The adjunct PP was not necessarily the same as the target
adjunct, so this measure does not provide an indicator of adjunct bias. In the norming
study, the pairs were randomly ordered on a list (together with 32 pairs of fillers that
varied in syntactic complexity and form), and within half of the critical pairs, the argument alternative was presented first. We created a second list by reversing the order
within each pair. Forty-two students from The Ohio State University were instructed
to read each pair of fragments and choose the one that sounded more natural. All
participants received credit in undergraduate, introductory psychology or linguistics
classes in exchange for their participation, and all were native speakers of English.

As we expected, there was an overall preference for the fragments containing PP
arguments in both the verb (73%) and noun (68%) conditions. The difference between
the noun and verb scores was not significant [t(30) = 0.53, p > 0.10]. Thus, the results
suggested that, in our materials (in contrast to the Clifton et al., 1991, materials),
the PP argument forms of the verbs and nouns were more accessible than competing
forms without PP arguments, and that the verbs and nouns were comparably biased
toward taking PP arguments.

Naturalness Ratings
The 16 critical items were randomized with 59 fillers and presented to students as
one of four balanced lists. Forty students from The Ohio State University (10 per list)
rated the naturalness of each sentence as a description of an event or situation on a
scale ranging from 1 (very unnatural) to 7 (very natural). The mean scores (and standard deviations) were 4.04 (0.48) and 3.67 (0.50) for the VP argument and adjunct
conditions, respectively, and 3.99 (0.57) and 3.76 (0.66) for the NP argument and
adjunct conditions. Argument conditions were rated as slightly better descriptions
than adjunct conditions [F(1, 12) = 8.502, p < 0.05] in a 4(list) x 2(argument status)
x 2(attachment site) ANOVA by items, but there were no effects of attachment site
(Fs < 0.1). The argument preference is predicted by the corpus analysis and forced
choice judgments, which both demonstrated that the argument-selecting form of the
verbs and nouns were more accessible than alternative forms without PP arguments.
Plausibility Ratings
Both the naturalness ratings and the forced-choice judgments suggested that our head
nouns and verbs are most naturally used with an argument. Thus, it is not possible to
match the argument and adjunct conditions for naturalness. We can, however, match
argument and adjunct conditions on real world plausibility. To estimate plausibility, 40
students from Rutgers University (10 per list) were asked to rate the likelihood of the
event in the sentence occurring in the real world, on a scale of 1 (likely) - 7 (unlikely).
The 16 critical items were randomized with 44 filler sentences, and four lists were
created. Each item appeared only once per list, and conditions were balanced within
and across lists. Following Schutze and Gibson (1999), all critical and filler sentences
were presented in the passive voice (e.g., Many cuts in the staff were announced by the
administrator) in order to eliminate any potential structural ambiguity. NP-attached
PPs always followed the subject. VP-attached PPs occurred either after the verb or
at the end of the sentence, whichever sounded more natural (e.g., Many cuts were
announced in the meeting by the administrator, but Some exemptions were offered by
the environmental agency from the start).
The mean scores (and standard deviations) for the VP argument and adjunct conditions were 2.91 (0.83) and 2.94 (0.84), respectively. The corresponding scores for
the NP argument and adjunct conditions were 2.78 (1.00) and 3.11 (0.78). In 4(list) x
2(argument status) x 2(attachment site) repeated measures ANOVAs conducted over
participant (F1) and item (F2) means, there was no effect of attachment site [Fs < 1.0]
or argument status [F1(1, 36) = 2.23, p = 0.14; F2(1, 12) = 1.50, p = 0.24], and
no interaction between the two [Fs < 1.1]. Therefore, any effects of argument status
obtained in the reading time data are unlikely to be due to differences in plausibility.
Eye Movement Study
This experiment was designed to test the prediction that argument PPs would be
processed more easily than adjunct PPs. This argument status effect is predicted both
by the PFH and by ASH. The PFH predicts an argument advantage because arguments co-occur more frequently with their heads, and thus a lexical structure with
the appropriate attachment site will be more strongly available. ASH predicts an
argument advantage because only argument PPs are lexically specified, and, if they

J Psycholinguist Res (2006) 35:385-403

393

occur frequently, they are likely to be selected over rule-generated adjunct options.
No effects of attachment site are predicted by ASH, although such an effect was
predicted by Clifton et al. (1991). Secondarily, we had hoped to test the prediction
that ease of argument attachment, but not adjunct attachment, would be correlated
with the argument/adjunct frequency for a given head noun or verb. The PFH would
predict that ease of PP processing is always a function of the co-occurrence frequency
between the PP type and the head noun/verb. Unfortunately, differential frequency
patterns between arguments and adjuncts were found, as described in the Corpus
Analysis section above. We will return to this issue in the Discussion and explain why
we could not adequately test hypotheses about the correlation between processing
load and argument/adjunct frequency.
Methods
Participants
Thirty-two students from Rutgers University participated either for credit in an undergraduate, introductory psychology class, or for a nominal sum. All were native speakers of English, who had normal vision or vision corrected to normal with soft contacts.
Materials
We developed 16 sets of sentences like the example in (5), repeated here as (6). The
full set of critical stimuli is in Appendix B. For every item, the verb remained constant
across all four conditions, and for 11 items, the same was true of the direct object
NP. The mean frequency (Francis & Kucera, 1982) of the direct object NP was 58 in
the first three conditions and 54 in the NP adjunct condition. The length averaged 8.5
characters in the first three conditions and 8.1 characters in the NP adjunct condition.
The preposition varied across the four conditions, though the same preposition was
used in the NP argument and VP adjunct conditions in 15 out of the 16 items.4 The
noun in the PP also differed across the four conditions. Length and frequencies (Francis & Kucera, 1982) for the noun are provided in Table 2. The nouns in the critical PP
of the two argument conditions were less frequent, averaging 159.5, than the nouns in
the two adjunct conditions, which averaged 191.5 Mean length was almost identical:
6.45 for argument conditions, 6.40 for adjunct conditions.

The 16 critical items and 120 filler sentences were randomized, and four lists were

an argument option. Counter to this, however, the direct object was a definite NP in 11 of 16 items. Altmann and Steedman (1988), Crain (1980), and Crain and Steedman (1985) have argued that definite
NPs bias reading time results toward VP-attachment.

balanced within and across lists. For data analysis, each critical item was divided into
five regions, separated by vertical bars in (8). The first region contained the subject
NP, the second region contained the verb, the third region contained the direct object
NP, the fourth region contained the PP, and the fifth region contained the final two
words, usually a temporal NP or adverbial phrase.
Procedure
A dental impression was made for each research participant and attached to a "bite
bar" in order to hold the participant's head in a fixed position. We also used a stationary headrest and an adjustable chin-rest to help secure the head in a comfortable
fashion. Eye fixations were measured using a Dr. Bouis monoculor oculometer. The
device provides two voltage outputs, corresponding to eye position along the X and
Y-axes. The sensor of the apparatus was first roughly aligned by mechanical means.
It was then further adjusted to give zero-output voltages when the participant looked
straight ahead, as well as balanced positive and negative voltages when the participant
looked at equidistant points along the X and Y-axes. The experimenter then ran a
calibration routine during which the participant was asked to fixate on nine disparate
points on the computer screen in order to establish the relationship between X/Y
voltages and screen position. Unless this could be done with an error rate of less than
10 pixels in each dimension, the experiment was aborted.
After successful calibration, participants began a series of 10 practice trials. The participants were simply instructed to read each sentence as it appeared, and be prepared
to answer comprehension questions after some of the trials. Half of the practice trials
were followed by a yes/no comprehension question; participants pressed a button to
indicate their answer. The set-up was re-calibrated between the practice trials and
the main experiment, using the same criterion. During the experiment, analog eye
position was digitized (1 kHz) and converted to screen coordinates. Each sentence
was presented on the screen in its entirety, on a single line. One-third of trials in
the actual experiment were followed by a yes/no comprehension question. None of
the questions addressed the attachment of the PP. For each trial, the screen position
and duration of each fixation were computed and stored. The set-up was recalibrated
periodically during the experiment to ensure accurate tracking of the eye movements.
The experiment took less than an hour.

Results
We computed four dependent measures in each of the regions that were outlined
in (8). We calculated the duration of the first fixation, the duration of all first pass
fixations (i.e., summing together multiple fixations in a region so long as there were
no intervening saccades to another region), and total reading time (i.e., summing

J Psycholinguist Res (2006) 35:385-403

together all first and secondary pass fixations). Because the PPs differed in length,
we also calculated an adjusted first pass fixation measure (as in Ferreira & Clifton,
1986; Garnsey, Pearlmutter, Myers, & Lotocky, 1997; and many others). We computed
the average reading time per character for each participant and used the slope and
intercept to predict the amount of time that would be spent in a region if length were
the only relevant factor.
The data from each critical region are summarized, for each of the dependent
measures, in Tables 3 - 5. The three regions of interest were the direct object region,
the PP region, and the final region. In general, we expected effects to emerge in the
PP region. We submitted each dependent measure to a 4(list) x 2(argument status:
argument or adjunct) x 2(attachment site: NP- or VP-attached) x 3(region) repeated
measures ANOVA, once using the participant means as input and once using the item
means.5

The first fixation data (summarized in Table 3) revealed a main effect of argument
status, with longer fixations in the adjunct conditions [F1(1, 28) = 6.14, p < 0.05;
F2(1, 12) = 19.59, p < 0.01]. This effect did not interact with region [Fs < 1.0],
perhaps due to unexpectedly long fixations on the direct object in the VP adjunct condition. Individual ANOVAs conducted at each region found only one fully reliable
effect: shorter fixations for argument conditions compared to adjunct conditions in
the final region [F1(1, 28) = 6.96, p < 0.05; F2(1, 12) = 6.30, p < 0.05]. Surprisingly,
there was no effect of argument for the first fixation on the PP itself [F1(1, 28) =

2.37, p > 0.10; F2(1, 12) = 2.16, p > 0.10], although our power to detect an effect of
the observed size was 0.81 by subjects and 0.75 by items ( = 0.05 for all analyses).
In the unadjusted first pass reading times (see the upper half of Table 4), we
again found an effect of argument status [F1(1, 28) = 6.77, p < 0.05; F2(1, 12) =
13.79, p < 0.01]. In addition, we found the expected interaction with region, though
the effect was marginal in the analysis by items [F1(2, 56) = 3.21, p < 0.05; F2(2, 24) =
3.24, p = 0.06]. In contrast to the first fixation data, the effect appeared largest in the
PP region. This was confirmed in individual ANOVAs conducted at each region. At
the direct object, argument status was reliable by items, but marginal by participants
[F1(1, 28) = 3.48, p < 0.10; F2(1, 12) = 9.19, p < 0.05]. This unexpected result may
help explain the null effect of argument at the PP in the first fixation data. If the PP
was processed parafoveally at the direct object by some readers, then the first fixation
on the PP itself might not reliably reflect initial parsing processes. Nonetheless, when
all first pass fixations in the PP region were considered, the argument status effect was
fully reliable [F1(1, 28) = 14.69, p < 0.01; F2(1, 12) = 16.67, p < 0.01]. No effects
were found in the final region.
The potential effect of attachment site in the overall ANOVAs approached significance in first pass reading times [F1(1, 28) = 3.91, p < 0.10; F2(1, 12) = 3.54, p <
0.10], with NP-attached conditions slower than VP-attached conditions. Because our
power to detect an effect of attachment was rather weak in these data ( = 0.59
by subjects and 0.36 by items, for an effect of the observed size), and because during the PP region, the effect was reliable by participants and marginal by items
[F1(1, 28) = 4.65, p < 0.05,  = 0.93; F2(1, 12) = 3.51, p < 0.10,  = 0.64], the
possible attachment effect warrants a closer look. To the extent that this effect is
real, it is reminiscent of Clifton et al.'s (1991) finding of longer reading times for NPattached PPs compared to VP-attached PPs. Such an effect was predicted by Frazier
and Clifton (1996), because all PPs should initially be attached as VP arguments. However, when we analyzed the adjusted first pass times (see the lower half of Table 4),6
only the main effect of argument status was preserved [F1(1, 28) = 10.38, p < 0.01;
F2(1, 12) = 20.59, p < 0.01].
The total reading times (see Table 5) exhibited the familiar effect of argument status
[F1(1, 28) = 6.06, p < 0.05; F2(1, 12) = 10.76, p < 0.01], which interacted with region
[F1(2, 28) = 6.36, p < 0.01; F2(2, 24) = 3.67, p = 0.05]. In individual ANOVAs by
region, there were no effects in either the direct object region or the final region. But as
expected, the argument conditions were read more quickly than the adjunct conditions
6 These times are skewed in the negative direction because all of our sentences are perfectly grammatical, while in contrast, many of the filler sentences contained anomalies. These anomalous sentences
did not appear to slow RTs for the critical sentences; reading rates were comparable to other eyetracking studies.

during the PP region [F1(1, 28) = 13.98, p < 0.01; F2(1.12) = 8.38, p < 0.05]. There
was also a trend toward an effect of attachment site, with marginally faster times
for VP-attached conditions in the overall ANOVAs [F1(1, 28) = 3.76, p < 0.10;
F2(1, 12) = 3.80, p < 0.10]. At the PP region, this effect was marginally reliable by
participants, but not by items [F1(1, 28) = 4.10, p = 0.05; F2(1, 12) = 2.59, p > 0.10].
Discussion
All four dependent measures indicate that argument attachments are easier than
adjunct attachments, using stimuli in which the PP argument-taking form of the
noun/verb is the dominant form. Furthermore, the effect of argument status was
immediate. The timing of the argument effects in the first fixation and first pass data
suggests that argument status influenced processing of the PP soon after recognition
of the relevant words. The early influence of argument status seen in our data is incompatible with parsing heuristics such as minimal attachment that predict an advantage
by attachment site (Frazier, 1978, 1987). Because the PPs in this experiment were
all potential primary phrases, global structural principles would apply, even within
Construal (Frazier & Clifton, 1996).
In sharp contrast to Clifton et al. (1991), any effects of attachment site in our data
are quite minor compared to the robust effects of argument status. The influence of
attachment site was limited to marginal effects in two dependent measures and may
be attributable to length effects at the PP. Thus, our results provide evidence against
parsing metrics or parsing preferences that routinely VP-attach PPs without regard
to detailed lexical representations.
Early effects of argument status were predicted by accounts in which detailed lexical information guides parsing. However, we are not able to differentiate between
several specific hypotheses about how lexical guidance occurs. In principle, the major
hypotheses could be distinguished by regressing argument/adjunct frequency against
fixation times. For example, the ASH, which we favor, maintains that argument attachments are generated from stored lexical alternatives, while adjunct attachments are
generated by global syntactic rules. This predicts a negative correlation between the
frequency with which a noun or verb assigns an argument and the ease of processing
the argument attachment; while at the same time, there should be no such correlation
in the processing of adjunct attachments. In contrast, the PFH maintains that argument and adjuncts are represented in the lexical entries of their heads (MacDonald
et al., 1994), predicting that frequency effects should hold for all attachments. On the
other hand, models that stipulate an argument preference (Abney, 1989; Schutze &
Gibson, 1999) do not predict correlations for either arguments or adjuncts.
In order to test these competing predictions with a regression analysis, the variance
in argument frequency must approximate the variance in adjunct frequency. Unfortunately, this condition did not hold; the co-occurrence frequency between the adjunct
categories and the head nouns/verbs was considerably less than the co-occurrence
frequency between the argument categories and the head nouns/verbs. Our linear
regressions, provided in Appendix C, are therefore merely suggestive and should not
be considered an adequate test of these hypotheses.
Another way to distinguish among some of the hypotheses would be to find positive
evidence for frequency effects on adjunct attachment. Such a pattern would clearly
support the PFH over ASH. To the best of our knowledge, only Spivey-Knowlton and
Sedivy (1995) come close to providing such evidence. They demonstrated in a corpus

398

J Psycholinguist Res (2006) 35:385-403

analysis that for action verbs, with-PPs are more likely to modify the verb than a direct
object (e.g., changed a tire with... a monkey wrench). In the case of psych/perception
verbs, with-PPs are more likely to modify a direct object than a verb (e.g., glanced
at a customer with... ripped jeans). In turn, processing of an ambiguously attached
with-PP was facilitated when the PP was consistent with attachment to the more frequent site. Because Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy assumed that all the with-PPs were
adjuncts, their findings appear to demonstrate that adjuncts are lexically specified
and, for that reason, produce frequency effects. However, it has long been noted that
instrument PPs have some argument qualities (see Schutze & Gibson, 1999). Therefore, it might be the case that instrument PPs are lexically specified, but as arguments
rather than adjuncts. In fact, Ferretti, McRae, and Hatherell (2001) also suggested
that instruments are lexically specified after finding that verbs prime their prototypical instruments in a lexical decision task. In contrast, they found no evidence that verbs
primed prototypical locations (e.g., cooked-kitchen), which are indisputably adjuncts.
While Ferretti et al.'s (2001) evidence that stir primes spoon might seem to provide
positive evidence that a lexicalized structure for stir contains a slot for an instrument
with spoon-like features, the finding is actually irrelevant to the question of argument
status or the possibility that certain adjuncts are lexically specified. Although they
used word association norms to demonstrate that their verbs were not associatively
related to their instrument primes, priming is commonly found in lexical decision
for nouns that are semantically, but not associatively, related (e.g., glove-hat; See
Lucas, 2000 and Neely, 1991; for reviews). Thus, the finding that stir primes spoon
is no more informative than if they had found that sneeze primes nose. The priming
effect is merely evidence that the two words are semantically or situationally related.
In contrast, Boland, Sudhakar, Lewis, and Blodgett (2001) do report some relevant
evidence. They replicated the Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy (1995) finding in locally
ambiguous sentences. However, Boland et al. did not find comparable "frequency
effects" in unambiguous constructions that used the same lexical items. This suggests
that the Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy effect was not due to differential activation of
lexicalized structure. Rather, Boland et al. suggest that the so-called frequency effects
that arise when there is a syntactic ambiguity are actually due to plausibility or semantic association. These constraints can guide syntactic ambiguity resolution, but they
cannot influence the initial generation of syntactic structure in Boland's (1997) theory.
While our results are consistent with the PFH, there is some reason to prefer the
ASH. First, Foraker and McElree (2001) found that verb argument, but not verb
adjunct, co-occurrence frequencies predicted processing success in an SAT paradigm,
providing further evidence that arguments and adjuncts are processed differently.
Second, ASH is more appealing for logical reasons. It is simply not possible to specify
all of the adjunct attachments that can modify a given head. Adjuncts can be adjoined
one after another in theoretically limitless numbers, as in (9).

a happy heart after breakfast with Edgar last Tuesday.

In sum, the ASH can account for parsing behavior when argument attachments
represent the strongest lexical competitors, and it includes a mechanism that explains
the parsing behavior of adjuncts. Additional work is needed in order to establish
(1) how competition effects between lexically generated, but weak, argument attachments and globally generated, but frequent, adjunct attachments are resolved, and
(2) how constraints combine to resolve adjunct attachments, in general. As these

J Psycholinguist Res (2006) 35:385-403

399

questions are investigated, the differing predictions of the ASH and the PFH will be
more thoroughly tested.
Appendix A
For each head verb and head noun used in our critical stimuli, we note the total frequency (for exact matches) in the Brown corpus. Collapsing across both the parsed
Brown corpus and the parsed WSJ corpus in the Penn Treebank Corpora, we also
report the proportion of tokens that co-occurred with a PP of the same role or having
the same preposition as the argument or adjunct PP in our critical stimuli.

Not all of the predicted correlations were statistically reliable, and the argument correlations were
not reliably different from the adjunct correlations in the analysis by participatory roles. Although the
size of the correlation coefficients was uniformly large for the argument conditions, the small number
of usable items led to low power:  ranged from 0.39 to 0.64 for the observed effect size. Thus, we are
inclined to trust the statistically weak correlations in the argument conditions. Interpreting the null
adjunct effects, in the face of even lower power values, is more difficult

Appendix C
As described in the Discussion section, we would have liked to distinguish between
the PFH and the ASH via regression analyzes. The two hypotheses make differential
predictions about whether negative correlations will be found between fixation times
and frequency for adjunct PPs. Unfortunately, there was much less variance in the
adjunct frequency data compared to the argument frequency data, making the lack of
adjunct correlations uninformative. Thus, we report the regression analyzes primarily
as a demonstration of the argument correlations, which were predicted by both PFH
and ASH. We regressed the first fixation data from the final region against frequency
data obtained in the corpora analysis described in Normative Studies. We chose to
regress proportions against the first fixation data from the final region for several reasons. This dependent measure provides the earliest measure of processing effects in a
given region, while the region reflects the argument advantage seen in the ANOVAs.
We regressed the proportion of argument and adjunct PPs (having the same role
and/or the same preposition as our target PP) from our corpora analysis against the
corresponding mean first fixation data from the final region, once for the verbs and
once for the nouns. For example, we regressed the total proportion of VP argument
PPs bearing the same role as the target against that target's mean fixation time in the
VP argument condition.7 As shown in Table 6, negative correlations were found for
the argument conditions only.
7 We also considered an alternative, but related, hypothesis. Perhaps the overall frequency of the
head noun/verb would predict initial fixation duration. On this account, it is not the relative frequency
of the competing lexical forms that is important, but rather the overall strength of the lexical entry. To
test this hypothesis, we computed the log frequency of all noun (or verb) forms for each head noun
(or verb). We regressed the log total frequency against initial fixation duration in the PP region and
the final region. No reliable or marginal correlations were found (VP-arg at PP, r = -0.34, at Final,
r = -0.38; NP-arg at PP, r = 0.07, at Final, r = 0.12; VP-adj at PP, r = 0.09, at Final, r = -0.07; NP-adj
at PP, r = 0.34, at Final, r = -16).

We conducted regressions at the PP region to be sure that we did not overlook any
reliable effects. There were none.
