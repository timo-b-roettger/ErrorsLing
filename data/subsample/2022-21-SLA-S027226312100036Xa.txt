Abstract
The primary aim of this study was to investigate prosodic prominence across three groups of
Sylheti-English bilinguals: first-generation who arrived as adults, first-generation who arrived as
children, and second-generation, i.e., born in the United Kingdom to parents who grew up in
Bangladesh. To measure prominence, f0, duration, and intensity were measured across disyllabic
words in Sylheti and English. The results showed significant differences in the f0 analysis.
Regarding monolinguals, Sylheti prominence displayed a rising contour, in contrast to the English
falling contour. In Sylheti, the bilinguals born in the United Kingdom were the only group
significantly different from the Sylheti monolinguals, displaying an English-like falling pattern
in their Sylheti prominence. In English, the late arrival bilinguals displayed a Sylheti-like prominence realization, but the early arrivals and those born in the United Kingdom approximated the
monolingual English prominence realization. Overall, language use patterns were the most significant factor related to the bilinguals' prominence realization.

INTRODUCTION

The current study investigates the production of prominence realization by SylhetiEnglish bilinguals. More specifically, this study focuses on speakers from the East
London Bangladeshi community, one of the United Kingdom's largest and most established ethnic communities. The dense urban nature of this community allows for the
exploration of intergenerational differences in production patterns, in both the heritage
(L1, Sylheti) and majority (L2, English) language because numerous generations live

close together. To date, research on the speech patterns in ethnic minority communities
has primarily focused on segmental aspects of speech, with much less known about the
prosodic patterns in such communities (but see, e.g., de Leeuw et al., 2012; Mennen,
2004). The current study adds to the growing body of research on prosodic patterns in
ethnic minority communities. Moreover, Sylheti-English bilinguals are an underresearched community, and to our knowledge, there is no previous description of the
prosodic patterns in this group. We, therefore, provide one of the first descriptions of
prosodic patterns in Sylheti-English bilinguals.
In this study, we define prominence in accordance with Ladd (2008) as "perceptible
gradual modifications of the phonetic prominence of the individual words [...] by gradual
changes in various acoustic parameters, adding a slight nuance of emphasis" (p. 8), and
thus we do not specify whether this prominence arises due to stress patterns specifically,
as there is disagreement (see below) as to whether Sylheti is a stress bearing language,
based on what we know about Standard Bengali. Noteworthy is, however, that previous
researchers have perceived stress on the penultimate syllable for words in focus position
in both English and Standard Bengali (see below, Khan, 2010; Shattuck-Hufnagel,
1988).1 Additionally, we use the term bilingual to describe people who use two or more
languages in their everyday lives (Grosjean, 1998, 2010), as "bilinguals do not necessarily
need to have perfect knowledge of all the languages they know to be considered as such"
(Fabbro, 2001, p. 201). In line with this, we use the term monolingual to describe people
who did not use two or more languages in their everyday lives, although functional
monolinguals may have had some knowledge of other languages.
The study had three objectives. First, as there is limited research on Sylheti prosody, the
initial objective was to explore and compare prominence in Sylheti and English monolinguals, and, if the prosodic patterns were found to differ, whether Sylheti follows the
Standard Bengali pattern, i.e., a lower relative f0 in the prominent syllable.
The second objective was to explore the L1 and L2 prominence patterns of SylhetiEnglish bilinguals, and, more specifically, intergenerational differences between bilingual speakers in the London Bangladeshi community.
Finally, the third objective was to explore the influence of factors (language use, length
of residence, and age of arrival) that might contribute to any potential variation between
our bilinguals.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON SPEECH IN HERITAGE LANGUAGE COMMUNITIES

There is a growing body of research on intergenerational differences in the production of
speech segments. Much of the variability found in L1 and L2 speech production patterns
of heritage language speakers can be accounted for by language use patterns and age of
arrival (see, e.g., Major, 1992; Nagy & Kocketov, 2013). In large diaspora communities in
the United Kingdom (UK), for example, one general pattern observed is that bilinguals
who arrived in the UK as adults are more likely to demonstrate monolingual-like
production patterns in the heritage language than subsequent generations, and that the
first generation are also more likely to demonstrate foreign-accented speech patterns in
English (e.g., Mayr & Siddika, 2016; McCarthy et al., 2013). Moreover, those born in the
UK often display non-native production in the heritage language, but acquire production
patterns that reflect their monolingual peers in English (Evans et al., 2007; McCarthy

564 Kathleen M. McCarthy and Esther de Leeuw
et al., 2014), although, as further discussed below, this is often dependent on language use
patterns. For example, McCarthy and colleagues (2013) found that first-generation
Sylheti-English bilinguals who had arrived as adults and resided in the UK for over
2 decades mostly produced Sylheti plosives with similar voice onset time (VOT) and had
vowel quality patterns like Sylheti monolinguals. The authors suggested that the maintenance of native-like monolingual heritage language production patterns was largely
driven by the dense nature of the community and ongoing use of the heritage language. In
contrast, in other ethnic minority communities, which are potentially not as dense as the
London Bangladeshi community, attrition of first language voicing contrasts has been
found within first generations, e.g., in English speakers residing in Brazil (Major, 1992)
and France (Flege, 1987), Russian speakers in the United States (Dmitrieva et al., 2010),
as well as phonetic drift in English native speakers acquiring Korean (Chang, 2012).
In comparison, those who arrive as children or second-generation bilinguals typically
display incremental changes toward the majority language production patterns in their
native language (Evans et al., 2007; Mayr & Siddika, 2016; McCarthy et al., 2013, 2011;
Nagy & Kocketov, 2013; Sharma & Sankaran, 2011; but see Kirkham & McCarthy,
2020). For example, Nagy and Kotchetov (2013) showed an intergenerational trend
toward the English VOT pattern in Russian and Ukrainian heritage language speakers
in Toronto, and Mayr and Siddika (2016) found incremental changes in VOT patterns
across generations of Sylheti heritage language speakers in Wales, UK.
Heritage language markers may also be retained to fulfil socio-indexical functions on
the part of the heritage language speakers (Alam & Stuart-Smith, 2011; Heselwood &
Mcchrystal, 1999, 2000; Kirkham, 2011; Sharma & Sankaran, 2011). Moreover, even in
first-generation bilinguals, there is preliminary evidence suggesting that not only general
attrition processes (i.e., the L2 influencing the L1) affect the native language, but also that
socio-indexical factors contribute to changes in both the L1 and L2 (de Leeuw, 2019;
Passoni et al., 2018).
What we therefore see is general processes affecting generational groups, but also
nuanced variation within generations that may be driven by factors such as language use
patterns. It is this variation that is explored in the current research through an investigation
of the prosodic patterns in Sylheti-English bilinguals.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON PROSODIC VARIATION IN BILINGUAL SPEECH

A small body of research has examined prosody in bilingual L1 and L2 speech. In general,
the findings indicate that L1 prosody is susceptible to change upon acquisition of an L2,
regardless of the age at which the L2 was acquired. For example, Mennen (2004) found
that adult Dutch speakers of L2 Greek living in the Netherlands assimilated toward Greek
tonal alignment patterns in their native Dutch, and that they were also unable to realize
Greek tonal alignment according to monolingual norms. Furthermore, in a longitudinal
study of Stefanie Graf over four decades, maximum pitch peaks in her German became
higher and more English-like over time from adolescence to mid-adulthood after her
move to the United States (de Leeuw, 2019). Additionally, in de Leeuw et al. (2012), some
late sequential German-English bilinguals in Vancouver, Canada, performed within
English monolingual norms in their German tonal alignment production, whereas others
displayed native German monolingual production patterns. Further investigation of this

same community suggested that the social and political environment of "being German"
in Vancouver may have influenced pitch realization of the German-English males, with a
wider pitch span and higher pitch level in both their German and English indexing
friendliness and helpfulness to dissociate themselves from the stereotypical image of
Germans in Canada as being aggressive (de Leeuw, 2020; Lieb, 2008). Moreover, in a
small group of Turkish-German simultaneous bilingual children (age 10-12 years), it was
found that there was bidirectional prosodic interaction with the children producing
Turkish prosodic patterns in German, and German prosodic patterns in Turkish
(Queen, 2001).
Prosodic influence is also possible between bilinguals in contact settings, which
promote larger changes within a community. For example, it has been argued that changes
in the prosodic patterns of L1 Argentinian Spanish coincided with a large wave of Italian
immigration, and with Argentinian Spanish converging with Italian due to direct and
indirect prosodic transfer (Colantoni & Gurlekian, 2004). Similarly, Spanish-Quechua
bilinguals in Peru have been reported to produce Spanish intonation patterns in their
Quechua (O'Rourke, 2005), and Simonet (2011) reports finding intonational convergence
in a language contact situation in Mallorca.
In brief, it has been found that bidirectional prosodic interaction is prevalent in both
bilingual speakers (children and adults), as well as larger communities in which convergence can occur.

PROMINENCE REALIZATION IN SYLHETI AND ENGLISH

As no previous research has been conducted on Sylheti prosody, this section focuses on a
discussion of Standard Bengali compared with English. The aim of this comparison is not
to enter into a discussion regarding a theoretical typology of Bengali and Sylheti, but
rather to provide a baseline for the Sylheti and English data to explore the production
patterns of the bilinguals.
In English, in the nuclear tone tradition (see e.g., Cruttenden, 1997), a prominent word
would generally be realized through a high-fall nuclear pitch accent on the stressed
syllable and a higher f0 is often considered to be the strongest cue for lexical stress
identification in English (Lieberman, 1960). Likewise, in the autosegmental metrical
framework (Beckman & Pierrehumbert, 1986; Ladd, 2008; Pierrehumbert, 1980), prominence would be encoded with a pitch accent, such as LH*, or simply H*, followed by an
L- phrasal tone.
In contrast, in Standard Bangladeshi Bengali, it has been proposed that either a low
pitch accent, L*, or a rising pitch accent, L*H, are used to mark focus (Khan, 2008;
Maxwell, 2010), but see Hasan (2015). Thus, in Bengali, a word in focus could be
described as having a low rising or "scooped" pitch accent on the prominent syllable
(Maxwell, 2010, p. 58). Notably, this "scooped" pitch accent is also included in the
inventory of pitch accents for English, but it is considered to be contextually specific
(Ladd, 2008). It has also been suggested that Bengali stress, if existing at all, is
consistently word-initial (Khan, 2010), indicated by means of a decrease in f0 (see,
e.g., Hayes & Lahiri, 1991 in Reetz & Jongman, 2009, p. 211), and that Bengali does
not "take advantage of higher f0 and greater intensity" to indicate syllable initial stress

566 Kathleen M. McCarthy and Esther de Leeuw
(Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1988, p. 98). However, notably, Hasan (2015, p. 63) found that focus
intonation in Bengali is H*L1 rather than L*Hp, as reported in Hayes and Lahiri (1991).
It is relevant to emphasize that an increase in f0 in the prominent syllable is often
considered to be quite regular within the world's languages with Danish listed as an
exception (Neppert, 1999) which is considered to be--as in the above discussion--
similar to Bengali through marking prominence (or indeed "stress" [Khan, 2010]) through
a relatively lowered pitch.
However, Ladd (2008) suggests that "Bengali (and probably most of the languages of
India) is an example of a language with non-stress accent and no lexical specification of
pitch" (p. 165). He continues, "[t]o my knowledge, all such languages clearly have `stress'
in Beckman's phonetic sense, and at least some of them have the possibility (like English
or Bengali, and unlike Japanese) of selecting different pitch accent types to convey
different pragmatic meanings". Stress, in this phonetic sense, is "a phonetic description
of one possible concrete realisation of the phonological abstraction" (Ladd, 2008, p. 164),
and, according to this definition, "is a cluster of phonetic properties that includes increased
intensity and duration as well as various spectral correlates [and] stressed syllables are
often accompanied by the major pitch movements we call pitch accent" (Ladd, 2008,
p. 164). De Jong et al. (1993) have similarly defined stress as a "set of prosodic categories
which involves relationships of relative prominence between syllables" (p. 199), i.e., not
solely a single phonetic correlate at the lexical level. Therefore, in our analysis of
prominent syllables in Sylheti and English, we obtained f0 measurements as well as
intensity and durational measurements in comparing the prominent penultimate syllable
with the final syllable, in disyllabic words.

THE CURRENT STUDY: THE LONDON BANGLADESHI COMMUNITY

This study focuses on Sylheti-English bilinguals from the London Bangladeshi community. The London Bangladeshi community is one of the most established ethnic minority
communities in the UK, with the most populous areas being in the London boroughs of
Newham, Tower Hamlets, and Camden (Office of National Statistics, 2011). Here, we
focus on bilinguals who reside in Tower Hamlets and Camden, where Bangladeshis are
the largest ethnic group, 32% and 8%, respectively (Office of National Statistics, 2011;
Tower Hamlets, 2018). Continuous migration from the region of Sylhet, Bangladesh,
since the 1950s, has resulted in a dense community made up of multiple generations. As
such, Sylheti is the dominant heritage language spoken at home and in the community
(see, e.g., McCarthy, 2013).
Sylheti prosody has not been documented in detail, and we are not aware of any previous
acoustic-phonetic studies. Here, we focus on Sylheti and English prominence realization as
produced across disyllabic words. Given the previous research on Bengali and English
prosody, we predicted that the disyllabic words, in a carrier phrase, would most likely be
realized in English with a decrease in f0 from the (stressed) penultimate to the ultimate
syllable; whereas in Sylheti, we considered it possible for the disyllabic words to be realized
with an increase in f0 from the penultimate to the ultimate syllable. For the purposes of the
current study, it is important to note that other phonetic cues of prominence in English, e.g.,
high intensity, longer duration, need not be characteristic of stress in South Asian languages

such as Bengali and Sylheti. However, for completeness and to see how such measures
behave in Sylheti, we also measured duration and intensity.

METHODS
PARTICIPANTS

Participants were 34 adults (18-63 years old), grouped according to place of birth and age
of arrival in the UK: 1. those who had arrived in the UK as adults (late), n = 9; 2. those who
had arrived in the UK as children (early), n = 8; 3. those who were born in the UK (secondgeneration), n = 6; 4. monolingual English, n = 6; 5. monolingual Sylheti, n = 5. All the
bilinguals resided in the London Bangladeshi community, namely Camden and Tower
Hamlets. Those born in Bangladesh were from the north-east district of Sylhet (see
McCarthy et al., 2013, for more details). All bilinguals had Sylheti as their L1, with no
extensive experience or formal education in Standard Bengali. The English monolinguals
were all born in the south of England and resided in Hackney or Tower Hamlets at the time
of recording. As it was not possible to record Sylheti monolinguals in Bangladesh, we
recruited functional Sylheti monolinguals, who were recent arrivals to the United Kingdom (i.e., no more than 3 months), with Sylheti as their L1. Although they reported some
English use, they had not attended formal English language classes in Bangladesh and had
no more than 1 month of English classes since arrival in the United Kingdom and did not
frequently use English in their daily lives.
Information on language use was also collected. Each participant was presented with a
list of interlocutors (e.g., when talking to parents, children, etc.), and social situations
(e.g., at work, local shops, etc.), and for each situation the speaker stated whether they
used English only, Sylheti only, or both English and Sylheti (categorized as "both" in the
questionnaire) with the named individuals in the social situations. Based on these
responses, a percentage for each language use category was calculated. A series of Tukey
adjusted t-tests revealed that late arrivals used significantly more Sylheti and less English
than both the early arrivals and second-generation participants (both p < .01). The late
arrivals reported to use both languages (e.g., code-mixing) in fewer situations than the
early arrivals (p  .01) (see Appendix A for full comparison tables). Additionally, we
collected data on age of arrival (AoA) to the United Kingdom and length of residence
(LoR) in the United Kingdom. See Table 1 for a summary of the background information.

PRODUCTION TASK

Each language was recorded separately on the same day with a 30 min to 1 hour break in
between. The order of the languages was counterbalanced across participants. The
recordings were made in a quiet room in the participants' home or workplace using an
H2 Zoom recorder with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, 16-bit-resolution. Using a picture
naming task, speakers were recorded producing disyllabic Sylheti and English words in a
carrier phrase (English: `Say ____again'; Sylheti: /aba____ x/). Therefore, the target
words were realized in focus position. A total of 10 words per language was elicited twice
in two separate randomized orders (see Table 2 for the full word list). The words were

568 Kathleen M. McCarthy and Esther de Leeuw
matched between languages as closely as possible and included mainly, if not only, voiced
syllables to ensure a smooth pitch contour, e.g., Sylheti [ada], donkey, versus English
[dn], garden.
ANALYSIS OF PROMINENCE REALIZATION

After an initial impressionistic analysis, for which it is important to note that the authors
perceived prominence on the penultimate syllable of the target words in both Sylheti and
English, mean f0, mean intensity (amplitude), and duration measurements were extracted
for the penultimate and ultimate vowel in the target vowels using Praat (Boersma &
Weenink, 2016) (see Mennen et al., 2020). An example of the vowel segmentation, which
was conducted manually, is shown in Figure 1. For f0 and intensity, standard Praat
settings were used, i.e., 75-500 Hz and 50-100 dB. A total of 1068 tokens were analyzed;
74 tokens were excluded from the analyses due to background noise, unclear speech, or

creaky voice. Frequency and intensity measurements were means over the entire vowel in
each syllable. For f0, measurements were converted to semitones (see Nolan, 2003).
Thereafter, all measurements were subsequently converted to a single value by subtracting the ultimate vowel measurement from the penultimate vowel measurement. This
resulted in a single value for each measurement: f0 in semitones (ST), duration in seconds
(s), and intensity in decibels (dB), with positive values indicating an increase, negative
values indicating a decrease, and 0 indicating no change.

RESULTS

Statistical analyses were run using R (R Core Team, 2019). For linear mixed-model
analyses the lmer function in the lme4 package was used (Bates et al., 2015), with type II
analysis-of-variance tables calculated using the package CAR (Fox & Weisberg, 2019).
Post-hoc Tukey adjusted group comparisons were conducted using the `emmeans'
package (Lenth et al., 2020).

MONOLINGUALS

As displayed in Figure 2, the Sylheti monolinguals had on average a rising pitch
movement (x = 1.1ST;  = 1.8), from the penultimate to the ultimate syllable, indicated
by the positive ST value. In contrast, as expected, the English monolinguals displayed an
average negative value (x = 1.4ST;  = 1.5), indicating a falling pitch movement from
the penultimate to the ultimate syllable.
For intensity, the Sylheti monolinguals displayed a negative difference between the
penultimate and ultimate syllable (x = 1.0dB;  = 3.1). The English monolinguals

also displayed a decrease in intensity from the penultimate to ultimate syllable (x =
3.6dB;  = 2.8).
For duration, the Sylheti monolinguals showed almost no difference between the
penultimate and ultimate syllables (x = 0.01s;  = 0.02). Overall, the English monolinguals also displayed little difference in duration from the penultimate and ultimate
syllable (x = 0.01s;  = 0.05), save open syllables which were longer.
COMPARISON OF BILINGUALS AND MONOLINGUALS

To investigate the bilingual Sylheti and English prosodic patterns, we ran separate linear
mixed effects models for each language and prominence measure (ST, s, dB). In all
analyses, the prominence measure was the dependent variable. Each model included
group (monolingual, late, early, second-generation) as a fixed factor, and participant and
word as random intercepts.
For Sylheti, we found a main effect of group for f0 (2(3) = 8.43; p < .05), but not for
intensity (2(3) = 1.21; p = .75) nor for duration (2(3) = 3.72; p = .29). Similarly, for
English, we found a main effect of group for f0 (2(3) = 21.74; p < .01), but not for
intensity (2(3) = 7.47; p < .06) nor for duration (2(3) = 6.51; p = .09).
To further explore the significant main effect of group for f0, Tukey HSD adjusted
pairwise group comparisons were conducted. In the Sylheti comparisons, a significant difference was found between the second-generation bilinguals ( x = 0.18ST; 
= 0.7), who were born in the United Kingdom, and the Sylheti monolinguals (p <
.05), with second-generation bilinguals displaying a production trend toward English.
In contrast, the late ( x = 1.1ST;  = 1.8) and early arrivals, who were born in
Bangladesh, (x = 0.2ST;  = 1.2) were not significantly different from the Sylheti
monolinguals (p > .05). There were no significant differences between any other
groups (p > .05).
For English, group comparisons, again with f0 as the dependent variable, revealed
that the late arrivals (x = 1.0ST;  = 1.3) were significantly different from the English
monolinguals, early arrivals (x = 0.8ST;  = 1.9) and second-generation bilinguals
(x = 1.3ST;  = 1.1), (all p < .01). There was no significant difference between any
of the other groups (p > .05). Specifically, early arrival and second-generation groups
used a pitch pattern similar to the English monolinguals, whereas, as a group, the late
arrivals used a Sylheti-like pitch pattern. See Appendix B for the full comparison
table and effect sizes.

EXPLORING INTERPERSONAL VARIATION

Observation of Figure 2 shows within-group variation between our participants' production patterns in Sylheti and English. To explore the potential factors underlying this
variation, we conducted a series of Pearson product-moment correlation analyses to
examine the relationship between the bilinguals' background factors (language use
patterns, LoR, AoA) and their Sylheti and English f0 production patterns, particularly
because the late arrival bilinguals used significantly more Sylheti and significantly less
English than the other two groups.

A summary of the correlations can be found in Table 3. For Sylheti, when all bilinguals
were grouped together, we found a significant positive correlation between the speakers'
f0 and Sylheti use, r(21) = .39, p = .05, indicating a more Sylheti-like prominence
realization for bilinguals who used more Sylheti in their daily lives. Additionally, again
when all bilinguals were grouped together, a negative correlation was revealed between
f0 and English use, r(21) = -.34, p < .05. Bilinguals who used more Sylheti (and, therefore,
less English) were more likely to follow a Sylheti-like pitch pattern in their Sylheti,
i.e., with a rise from the penultimate syllable to the ultimate syllable.
For English f0, when all bilinguals were grouped together, we found a positive
correlation between f0 and Sylheti use, r(21) = .45, p < .05, and a negative correlation
between f0 and English use, r(21) = -.46, p < .05, indicating that those who used more
English (and, therefore, less Sylheti) were more likely to follow an English-like prominence pattern in their English.
Of interest, no significant correlations were found between f0 and the participants' LoR
nor AoA, for English or Sylheti (see Table 3), indicating that language use was the most
significant determiner of prominence realization in the bilinguals' speech.
DISCUSSION

Our analysis of the Sylheti monolinguals revealed that, in general, prominent syllables
were realized through an increase in f0 from the penultimate to the ultimate syllable, with
the f0 of the prominent penultimate syllable being lower than the ultimate syllable. This
pattern aligns with what some researchers have found in Standard Bengali (Khan, 2008,
2010; Maxwell, 2010; Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1988). For English, the monolinguals realized
prominent syllables through a decrease in f0 from the penultimate to the ultimate syllable.

Prosodic Patterns in Sylheti-English Bilinguals

573

We did not find salient differences between the two monolingual group measurements
for duration and intensity, although goals of future research may be to investigate these
factors in larger monolingual groups. As the difference between intensity and duration of
the penultimate and ultimate syllables in Sylheti monolingual speech was negligible, we
interpret that a lower pitch of the penultimate (and here first because the words were
disyllabic) syllable in relation to the ultimate syllable is the primary correlate of prominence realization in Sylheti.
The second aim of this research was to explore the realization of prominent syllables in
Sylheti-English bilinguals residing in the London Bangladeshi community. Our analyses
only found significant group differences for f0, substantiating the important role of pitch
in prominence realization in Sylheti and English.
For f0, our findings showed that Sylheti production of the late and early arrivals, who
were born in Bangladesh, was not significantly different from the Sylheti monolinguals,
with both groups revealing a rise from the penultimate to the ultimate syllable of the
disyllabic words. This lack of significant difference in Sylheti between the Sylheti
monolinguals and the late and early arrivals indicates first language maintenance within
this community. Such findings are somewhat in contrast to the previously discussed
studies (Colantoni & Gurlekian, 2004; de Leeuw et al., 2012; Mennen, 2004; O'Rourke,
2005; Queen, 2001; Simonet, 2011), which showed that prosodic features are malleable
even in first-generation bilinguals. However, it is important to note that the late and early
arrivals displayed some variation in production patterns, with some speakers indeed
displaying a falling f0 contour.
These overall Sylheti monolingual-like patterns found in our late and early arrival
speakers may have been due to the dense language environment of the London
Bangladeshi community. For example, in the study by de Leeuw et al. (2012), it could
be argued that the German-English bilinguals were not the dominant ethnic group
within the local Vancouver community (most immigrants to British Columbia speak
either Cantonese, Mandarin, or Punjabi as their home language, German ranks 10th as
most popular home language in British Columbia, see e.g., Statistic Canada, 2016). In
contrast, the Bangladeshi community is one of the largest ethnic groups in the London
Boroughs studied here, so there may have simply been more opportunities for the
bilinguals of the current study to speak their L1, also with new arrivals, which would
give rise to more native-like phonetic realizations in the heritage language. This
interpretation would align with our finding that the bilinguals who used Sylheti more
frequently were also more likely to produce the prominent syllables in line with the
Sylheti monolinguals. In other words, the bilinguals of the current study might have
had more opportunity to speak their native language than the bilinguals in the other
research, and those who took advantage of this opportunity would have displayed more
Sylheti-like prosody patterns.
However, our finding that the late arrival's Sylheti production did not significantly
differ from the monolingual Sylheti speakers, may also be explained by examination of
the prosodic variable in question. If a decrease in f0 on the prominent syllable is
considered unique among the world's languages (Neppert, 1999), it may also be that
the realization of this prosodic variable was more salient to the Sylheti-English bilinguals,
and, therefore, potentially more easily maintained than prosodic variables examined in
other studies.

574 Kathleen M. McCarthy and Esther de Leeuw
Furthermore, in their Sylheti, bilinguals who were born in the UK were not significantly
different from the late or early arrivals, but they were significantly different from the
Sylheti monolinguals, displaying a production trend toward English. To some extent,
these findings align with segmental research in similar communities that has shown that
second-generation speakers often exhibit non-native features in the heritage language
(Kupisch et al., 2014; Mayr & Siddika, 2016; McCarthy et al., 2013, 2014, 2011; but see
Kirkham & McCarthy, 2020). This pattern might have been driven by their Sylheti
language use patterns. Overall, less Sylheti use was associated with their falling English
pitch realization, but it could also be in line with the fact that some of the late and early
arrivals were patterning somewhat English-like, and that the second-generation speakers
acquired the falling English pitch realization from the late and early arrivals (see, e.g.,
Rothman, 2007).
For English production, we found incremental differences between the bilingual
groups, with the late arrivals producing Sylheti-like pitch patterns and the early arrivals
and those born in the United Kingdom approximating the monolingual English pattern.
These findings are similar to previous segmental research, which found that firstgeneration speakers typically exhibit patterns that reflect their first and dominant language
(Khattab, 2000; Mayr & Siddika, 2016; McCarthy et al., 2013), and second-generation
and those who arrived in the UK as children behave similarly to their monolingual peers
(Evans et al., 2007; Mayr & Siddika, 2016; McCarthy et al., 2013, 2014, 2011). Such
trends are again possibly due to differences in language use and linguistic experience
between our speaker groups. The late arrivals spent their early adulthood in Bangladesh.
Their increased exposure to English would have started when they arrived in the United
Kingdom, with Sylheti often continuing to be the dominant language spoken at home and
in the community, in contrast to the other two bilingual groups who used significantly less
Sylheti.
It is noteworthy that the early arrivals were the only group that had acquired
monolingual-like prominence patterns in both languages. Thus, the combination of early
Sylheti exposure coupled with continued English use thereafter potentially contributed to
the patterns for the prosodic feature explored in the current study. Although not investigated in the current study, it is also possible that socio-indexical factors play a role in the
production patterns of the early arrival and second-generation bilinguals, such as attitudes
and affiliation toward the heritage and majority language and culture (see, e.g., Alam &
Stuart-Smith, 2011; Heselwood & Mcchrystal, 1999, 2000; Kirkham, 2011; Sharma &
Sankaran, 2011). One avenue for future research could be to incorporate factors such as
identity, attitudes, and style.
Our final aim was to explore the effect of language use, length of residence, and age of
arrival on the bilinguals' prominence realization. Our findings highlighted language use
as a key driver in the bilinguals' prosodic patterns. Specifically, our correlation analyses
showed that an increase in English use was associated with a more monolingual-like
English prominence realization, and an increase in Sylheti use resulted in more
monolingual-like Sylheti prominence, regardless of when the bilinguals arrived in the
UK. This finding became apparent when all groups were merged together. Again, this
result, which is somewhat in contrast to other research (which shows that age of
acquisition can be a significant factor in determining language proficiencies [see, e.g.,
Ortega, 2014, for an overview]) may again have arisen due to the unique community we

Prosodic Patterns in Sylheti-English Bilinguals

575

investigated. As already mentioned, it may be that because the community was large and
dense, it was simply possible to have more diverse input from the L1 than other minority
communities would receive in their L1. Moreover, previous studies into L2 acquisition
and the interaction between the L1 and L2 have focused on segmental aspects, with only a
few studies exploring prosodic variables (de Leeuw, 2019, 2020; de Leeuw et al., 2012;
Mennen, 2004; O'Rourke, 2005; Queen, 2001; Simonet, 2011). It may, therefore, be that
age of acquisition effects can be more easily compensated with enough language input for
prosodic dimensions of speech, but not as readily for segmental aspects of speech.
In brief, although our findings are based on a small subset of the London Bangladeshi
community, and likely do not represent the group in its entirety, we found that, overall,
there was a salient difference in prominence realization between Sylheti and English
monolinguals, with Sylheti pitch tending to evidence a rising contour and English pitch
tending to evidence a falling contour from the prominent penultimate syllable to the
ultimate syllable (see also Khan, 2008; Maxwell, 2010; Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1988).
Moreover, when groups were compared, prominence tended to be a relatively robust
variable in Sylheti, such that only those born in the UK evidenced a significant difference
from the Sylheti monolinguals. Alternatively, prominence realization in English was only
not successfully acquired by the late arrival group, whereas the early arrivals and those
born in the UK realized prominence similar to the English monolinguals.
Although we found these intergenerational group differences, our results further
suggested that language use was the most significant predictor variable in determining
prominence realization, with more Sylheti use associated with Sylheti-like prosodic
patterns, and more English use associated with English-like prosodic patterns. These
findings enhance both our understanding of prosody in the world's languages, as well as
the production of prosody in bilinguals more generally.
COMPETING INTERESTS

We have no conflict of interest to disclose.
NOTE
1
An issue when examining bilinguals is always that the descriptors used for one language are not
necessarily applicable to the other (i.e., it is widely accepted that English is a stress bearing language, although
this is debated with regard to Sylheti, which is considered to be closely related to Bengali, and, therefore, the term
"stress" is not necessarily appropriate for both languages). We decided to use the term prominence to describe
our phonetic variable as we considered it to be the most neutral term which could be applied to both languages in
question, given that the primary purpose of this research was to investigate prosodic patterns in Sylheti-English
bilinguals.
