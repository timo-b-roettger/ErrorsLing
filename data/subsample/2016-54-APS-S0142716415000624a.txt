ABSTRACT
For decades, developmental research has involved the study of sex differences in language acquisition.
Many studies of these differences have found a slight advantage in competence for females early
in life that seems to wane with age. However, because most of these studies have focused on sex
differences in mean values, they have mostly neglected sex differences in variance with males being
more variable. In the current study, we examined sex differences in language competence in terms
of mean values and variance in large samples (N > 10,000) of German children aged 3-6 years.
We administered several tests to assess the children's vocabulary, grammar, speech comprehension,
pronunciation, and the processing of sentences and nonce words. Girls performed better than boys
in all domains, most often to a statistically significant degree, although the effect sizes were small.
Differences decreased with age. Boys varied significantly more than girls in their language competence.
In response, we discuss explanations for these findings, as well as recommend directions for future
research.

The differences between the sexes have been extensively studied for decades
(Kimura, 2000; Mealy, 2000; Zell, Krizan, & Teeter, 2015), and language-related
sex differences have attracted considerable scientific attention (Dindia & Canary,
2006). Research on the topic has revealed that, to gain and maintain status, men's
verbal behavior is oriented more than women's toward competition, dominance,

self-assertion, and hierarchy, especially in all-male groups (Eckert & McConnellGinet, 2003; Guiller & Durndell, 2007; Lange, 2011; Locke & Bogin, 2006). By
contrast, women show more sociability in their communication (e.g., Haas, 1979).
Another branch of such research has revealed that women slightly outperform
men on several language tasks, though the difference is usually small and robust
for only some verbal fluency tasks (Hyde & Linn, 1988; Kimura, 2000; Maccoby
& Jacklin, 1974; Wallentin, 2009). In terms of language acquisition, girls also
seem to have a slight advantage over boys (Ullman, Miranda, & Travers, 2008),
as Stern and Stern (1987/1907) proposed in the early twentieth century.
The younger the child and the more basic the linguistic domain, the stronger
this language-related sex difference seems (Wallentin, 2009). At the age of 8-16
months, girls outperform boys in word comprehension, and at age 8-30 months,
in word production as well (Fenson et al., 1994). Feldman et al. (2000) have
shown a female advantage in vocabulary production at the age of 1-2 years,
which Galsworthy, Dionne, Dale, and Plomin (2000) and Szagun, Stumper, and
Schramm (2009) have supported with similar findings. In a Swedish sample,
Berglund, Eriksson, and Westerlund (2005) revealed a female advantage in both
vocabulary production and vocabulary comprehension at the age of 18 months, a
result that Bleses et al. (2008) similarly found in a Danish sample. The findings
of another study involving French-speaking Canadian children aged 8-30 months
were also comparable (Bouchard, Trudeau, Sutton, Boudreault, & Deneault, 2009).
Furthermore, as Bornstein Hahn, and Haynes (2004) have demonstrated, at the age
of 2-5 years females have an advantage over males in several linguistic domains,
including vocabulary production, verbal comprehension, sentence complexity,
and use of expressive language. Girls also reach the milestone of possessing a
productive vocabulary of at least 50 words sooner than boys (Nelson, 1973). It
is important that this last threshold is used to distinguish so-called late talkers
and children of nondelayed linguistic development (Rescorla, Hadicke-Wiley, &
Escarce, 1993; Rescorla & Schwartz, 1990).
By contrast, concerning sex differences in the acquisition of morphosyntactic
aspects of language and grammar, results show either far less consistency or small
effect sizes (Bornstein et al., 2004; Fenson et al., 1994). The general heterogeneity
of such findings suggests that, regarding grammar and in later childhood, sex
differences are especially minor, if not nonexistent (Bornstein et al., 2004; HayiouThomas, Dale, & Plomin, 2012; Wallentin, 2009). Altogether, the various findings
arguably support that girls' language acquisition is quicker than boys', though
this advantage fades around school age at about 6 years (Beltz, Blakemore, &
Berenbaum, 2013; Bornstein et al., 2004; Wallentin, 2009).
However, it is important that all of the above sex differences refer to mean
values, even though the sexes might also differ in variability (Feingold, 1992,
1995), as the male sex generally shows greater phenotypic variance than the
female sex for several traits. Greater variance among males than females has been
found, for instance, in terms of verbal proficiency (e.g., Hedges & Nowell, 1995;
Strand, Deary, & Smith, 2006). Men seem to be overrepresented at both ends
of the distribution of language competence. On the one hand, nearly all areas of
life in which verbal proficiency facilitates social success and status are somewhat
dominated by men. Most writers are men (Lange & Euler, 2014; Miller, 1999),
for example, an overrepresentation that also characterizes other verbally oriented

occupations, such as those in law, journalism, politics, higher education, and public
speaking (Burling, 1986, 2005; Halpern, 2000).
On the other hand, regarding poor verbal abilities at the other end of language
competence, evidence of men's overrepresentation, even during childhood, is
more convincing (Zubrick, Taylor, Rice, & Slegers, 2007). It is well known that
language impairments, disorders, and pathologies, including dyslexia, stuttering,
and developmental language disorders, are more prevalent in males than in females
(Andrews, 1964; Arden & Plomin, 2006; Ardila, Rosselli, Bateman, & Guzman,
2000; Bloodstein, 1995; Canning & Lyon, 1989; Felsenfeld et al., 2000; Halpern,
2000; Thomson & Polnay, 2002). Such findings indicating that more males than
females are affected by language problems are furthermore quite robust, as research
has long shown (Eme, 1979; Fairweather, 1976; Ingram, 1975; Jespersen, 1922).
These examples of greater variance among males than females with respect
to language are moreover supported by statistical analyses. For instance, Strand
et al. (2006) demonstrated greater male than female variance regarding verbal
classification, sentence completion, and verbal analogies. In addition, Hedges
and Nowell (1995) found greater variance among males in terms of vocabulary,
reading, and writing, similar to what Reynolds, Hewitt, Erickson, and Silberg
(1996) found in terms of oral reading ability.
To our knowledge, however, only Eriksson et al. (2012) have studied sex differences according to variance in the language acquisition of children (aged 1-2
years). Moreover, the study did not find any evidence to suggest greater variance
among males than females, at least not at such a young age. It is therefore possible
that sex differences in variance do not emerge until around the age of 3 years
(Arden & Plomin, 2006; Eriksson et al., 2012). At the same time, it could simply be too difficult to measure such young children's language competence to
sufficiently detect sex differences in variance before the age of 3 years.
Because language-related sex differences in variance have been widely ignored,
especially regarding early language development, the objective of this study was
to assess sex differences, in terms of both means and variance, in language acquisition in several linguistic domains (e.g., vocabulary and grammar) among a
representative sample of German preschool children aged 3-6 years. In so doing,
we sought to discover whether sex differences not only in mean values but also in
variance emerged in different domains of language development. The age range
in our research (3-6 years) seemed more appropriate based on previous research
on sex differences in language acquisition, as reported above.

METHODS
Participants

The present study is a retrospectively conducted analysis of all available data
originally collected during the development of a language screening test (Euler
et al., 2010; Neumann, Holler-Zittlau, et al., 2011). Data were collected in several towns and rural areas in the states of Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia in
Germany during 2007-2012. As Table 1 shows, there were three parts with different test batteries and samples: Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3. The study thus

consisted of three samples because data were collected on several occasions during
the construction of the language screening test.
For Sample 1, speech and language tests were administered in daycare centers
in Hesse as part of a universal language screening. Participants were therefore
recruited regardless of variables such as socioeconomic or ethnic background and
the native language of parents. Because nearly all children in Germany attend
daycare centers (2010 data shows percentages ranging from 89% for 3-year-old
to 96% for 4- and 5-year-old children; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2012), Sample 1
can be considered unselected.
Contrary to Sample 1, participation in Samples 2 and 3 was not obligatory
and required the informed consent of parents or caregivers. For Sample 2, letters
were written to more than 1,000 daycare centers. Both the daycare centers and
families were contacted without any preselection, though some facilities (e.g.,
Catholic ones) and parents (e.g., those with a very limited command of the German language) tended to abstain from participation in the study. The number of
participants per daycare center varied greatly, from 1 to 60, depending on its size
and enrollment of children of the required age group. For Samples 1 and 3, dropout
from the study was rare because children were tested and, if necessary, retested
until they completed the entire battery.
Participation in the study for Sample 2 was predominantly organized by the
University Hospital of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, whereas that for Sample 1
was mostly organized by various public health departments. Therefore, although
most children were tested in Hesse, the geographical overlap between the test
locations of Samples 1 (predominantly Frankfurt am Main) and 2 (predominantly
beyond Frankfurt am Main) was minimal.
For Sample 3, the parents of all children who had been invited to three public
health departments for the nationally mandatory school enrollment examination
were contacted. The tests administered in Sample 3 were selected to improve the
typically brief and thus unreliable screening tests of language skills in the school
enrollment examination. Accordingly, parents who gave their informed consent
to participate in the study for Sample 3 might have been more concerned with
the language development of their children than those in Samples 1 and 2. Some
indirect evidence supports this assumption, namely, that the rate of children who
stuttered was, at least on a descriptive level, greater in Sample 3 (5%) than in
Samples 1 (1%) and 2 (2%). All samples consisted of both monolingually German
and bi- or multilingual children.
Although children in Sample 1 did not reappear in either Sample 2 or Sample 3,
158 children from Sample 2 had also been invited to the public health departments
for their school enrollment examination because tests for Sample 3 were being
conducted there. As such, these children (94 males, 64 females) were retested for
Sample 3. The time span between participation in the tests in Samples 2 and 3
ranged from 0 to 33 months, with a median of 15 months.
Language tests and questionnaires

All participating children were tested with several language tests. The diversity of
tests employed was because data used in the current study originated during the

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6

1422

development of the above-mentioned language screening test, for which several
different language tests were used. All available tests were reused for the statistical
analysis of sex-related differences in language competence because it was possible
that two tests addressing the same linguistic domain would yield contradictory
results. The same reasoning motivated the use of not one, but all three available
samples for this retrospective study.
Depending on their respective sample, children were tested with a validated
and modified version of the language test Marburger Sprachscreening (MSS; Euler et al., 2010; Neumann, Holler-Zittlau, et al., 2011) or other validated speech
and language tests or both. Pronunciation (i.e., phonetic and phonological skills)
was tested with the common German-language tests MSS, the Psycholinguistische Analyse kindlicher Sprechstorungen (Fox, 2005), and the Screening des
Entwicklungsstandes bei Einschulungsuntersuchungen (S-ENS; Dopfner, Dietmair, Mersmann, Simon, & Trost-Brinkhues, 2005). The MSS includes, among
others, a spontaneous speech task with two items: children were asked to describe
what they see on the MSS picture, and some items later, they were allowed to ask
the language tester anything they wanted in regard to the same picture. Grammar
was also examined with the MSS, as well as the Sprachentwicklungstest fur dreibis funfjahrige Kinder (SETK 3-5; Grimm, 2001), additional validated S-ENS
items (S-ENS add.; Neumann, Zaretsky, & Euler, 2011), and the Entwicklungstest
Sprache fur Kinder von 4 bis 8 Jahren (ETS 4-8; Angermeier, 2007). Meanwhile,
tasks concerning vocabulary were part of the MSS, the Aktiver Wortschatztest
fur 3- bis 5-jahrige Kinder--Revision (AWST-R; Kiese-Himmel, 2005), and the
S-ENS add. Subtests addressing speech comprehension were part of the MSS,
ETS 4-8, and SETK 3-5. The MSS, S-ENS, S-ENS add., SETK 3-5, ETS 4-8,
and AWST-R use color illustrations of many child-relevant activities and objects
to initiate utterance and test various abilities. The MSS was excluded from the test
battery for Sample 3 because it was designed for younger children.
The MSS and S-ENS also examine phonological short-term memory by way
of the repetition of sentences and nonce words. For Sample 1, however, the
repetition of sentences and nonce words was not part of the MSS. At the same
time, the Mottier (1951) test, which examines phonological short-term memory
and speech-motoric coordination and consists of nonce words that children have
to repeat, was used in its updated version (Kiese-Himmel & Risse, 2009).
For the AWST-R, two different short versions with partly different items were
designed and validated: one for Sample 2 (i.e., younger children) and one for
Sample 3 (i.e., older children). The original German version of the AWST-R
contains 75 items and is thus too extensive to be part of a test battery for preschool
children. The most appropriate items were selected for inclusion on the basis of
data collected in previous studies. The internal consistency of the abbreviated test
AWST-R showed a Cronbach  of 0.94 (cf.  = 0.95 for a full-test version in our
sample of 208 children). For further details on the included samples, see Table 1.
Questionnaires for parents (Samples 2 and 3) and daycare center teachers (Samples 1 and 2) were also developed during the construction of the above-mentioned
language screening test (see Appendix A). Apart from addressing the demographic
and sociolinguistic characteristics of children, these questionnaires sought the
subjective judgments of daycare center teachers and parents regarding children's
language competence (e.g., whether the child uses articles correctly).

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6

Children's compliance was tested using a 3-point ordinal scale (good, average,
and poor) with the MSS in Samples 1 and 2 and with the S-ENS add. in Sample
3. Poor compliance indicated that the child did not cooperate with the examiner
and that it was almost impossible to complete all tasks with the child.
Expert panels were also held for all samples to assess the children's language
development based on questionnaires and language tests, including audio records.
Experts such as speech and language pathologists, researchers in linguistics, and
professors classified participants as (a) needing or not needing additional education
support (e.g., language courses) in acquiring and learning German; and (b) needing
or not needing additional medical help in acquiring and learning German.
Demographic and sociolinguistic characteristics of the samples

The age difference between boys and girls in Samples 2 and 3 was not significant
according to the Mann-Whitney U test (ps  .263). For Sample 1, no exact
information regarding the age of participants was available, though children were
normally tested within 2-3 months after reaching 4 years of age.
To control whether the sociolinguistic background of boys and girls was comparable in Samples 2 and 3 (no such information was available for Sample 1),
several variables from the questionnaires for parents and daycare center teachers
were compared using cross tables. There were no significant differences in the chisquare values of variables that might have influenced the language development of
participants (ps  .13). This group contained several variables: whether the child
attends the daycare center for a half or whole day; attended nursery school during
the first 2 years of life; receives educational support (e.g., language courses) in
learning German; plays after daycare with peers who speak German, or if not
a native German speaker, plays with peers who speak the same other language;
attends the daycare center regularly; enjoys coming to the daycare center; likes to
play with other children; and is involved in extracurricular activities (e.g., clubs).
The proportion of immigrant children was not significantly different between boys
and girls (ps  .480), and there were no significant differences in the length of
contact with the German language between boys and girls in this group according
to the Mann-Whitney U test (ps  .309). Similarly, no significant differences were
identified between boys and girls in Samples 2 and 3 in terms of length of daycare
center attendance (ps  .467).
To control whether medical variables were comparable for both sexes, further
information provided by the questionnaires from Samples 2 and 3 was analyzed.
No significant differences emerged in the following variables describing children
as examined in cross tables using chi-square tests (ps  .06): has a mental handicap, has a permanent hearing disorder, has a permanent sight disorder, has frequent
inflammations of the middle ear, has an auditory processing disorder, takes medication, receives therapy, has considerable or severe illness, was a premature baby
or had a difficult birth, and has a disorder or illness influencing language development. However, in Sample 3, boys showed significantly (5%) more disorders
and illnesses that can influence language development than did girls, 2 (1) =
6.06, p = .014, Ns = 396 males, 365 females, while in Sample 2, boys more
often showed problems with hearing than did girls; the proportion of boys with
such problems was often or always 2.3% greater, 2 (4) = 47.82, p < .001,

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6
Lange et al.: Sex differences in language competence

1424

N = 958 males, 793 females. However, this result is not surprising, because boys
are generally overrepresented among children with language deficits, as explained
earlier, and hearing disorders (Commission of the European Communities, 1979;
Finck-Kramer, Spormann-Lagodzinski, & Gross, 2000). Furthermore, there were
no significant differences in the following family-related variables as cross tables
using chi-square tests showed (ps  .082): parents with problems with reading
and writing, family member with a language disorder, and family member who
stutters.
For Sample 2, total scores of correct answers on the language screening MSS
were compared for three different age groups: 3-year-olds (N = 115 males, 114
females; median age = 3 years, 8 months [3;8]), 4-year-olds (N = 1,288 males,
1,062 females; median age = 4;3), and 5-year-olds (N = 148 males, 127 females;
median age = 5;4). Again, sociolinguistic and demographic characteristics of children were compared on the basis of questionnaires for parents and daycare center
teachers. For the subsample of 3-year-old children, no statistically significant differences between boys and girls were identified regarding any demographic or
sociolinguistic variables. Meanwhile, 4-year-old boys more often than girls did
not hear well according to our data, 2 (4) = 48.62, p < .001, N = 860 males, 691
females, though there were no further differences between the sexes. By greater
contrast, according to our data, 5-year-old boys suffered more often than girls
from language-related disorders or illness, 2 (1) = 5.63, p = .018, N = 18 males,
23 females, and from hearing disorders, 2 (4) = 11.32, p = .023, N = 21 males,
23 females, as well as significantly more often received some kind of therapy,
2 (1) = 5.54, p = .019, N = 104 males, 80 females. After the application of
either Bonferroni or Bonferroni-Holm adjustment and considering the low size
of Sample 3, only results with p < .001 are considered statistically significant.
In Sample 1, boys and girls were not significantly different according to the proportion of mental handicaps, hearing disorders, and family language disorders, as
cross tables using chi-square tests showed (ps  .065). Because no further demographic or sociolinguistic variables were available, the sexes in Samples 1-3 were
assumed to be widely comparable, and medical or socioeconomic confounding
factors were assumed to not exist.
A small subgroup in Sample 2 also participated in the Colored Progressive
Matrices (CPM) intelligence test (Raven, 2009). The difference between boys
(n = 105, M = 16.07, SD = 4.11) and girls (n = 70, M = 16.76, SD = 3.39) was
not significant (p = .138), though girls scored numerically higher and boys showed
numerically greater variance, as could be expected (Arden & Plomin, 2006). Both
for the CPM test and for all language tests, only the total scores of correct answers
were used in calculations, without any transformation of data or weighting of test
items. The CPM test had a total of 29 items; the total numbers of items on the
language tests and subtests appear in Tables 2-4.
Statistical analyses

According to Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, data were not normally distributed
(p < .05), which recommended the use of nonparametrical tests. In most cases,
differences between boys and girls were assessed with Mann-Whitney U tests,

for which a nonparametric effect size value p (probability of superiority [PS]) was
provided (Grissom & Kim, 2012). If both groups did not differ, then p = .50, and
if all values of one group were less or greater than all values of the other, then p =
1 (p = 0). A result of p = .50 is comparable to a Cohen d = 0.00, whereas a result
of p = .05 or .95 corresponds more closely to an exceptionally high negative or
positive d effect size. Because nonparametric effect sizes are not widely known,
the Cohen d value (Cohen, 1988) was also calculated, though it applies strictly to
parametric comparison. Negative d values indicate higher scores among females.
For dichotomous or categorized variables (e.g., compliance and stuttering), cross
tables with chi-square values were calculated. To analyze whether boys demonstrated greater variance than girls in their language test scores, F tests were used.
For all tests, sample sizes were reported as number of boys versus number of
girls. All calculations were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences version 20.
RESULTS
Sex differences in mean values among the samples

Table 2 presents the differences between boys and girls in Sample 1. Despite significant results in all linguistic domains, the effect sizes were small, as all values
for Cohen d were roughly 0.1-0.2. Exclusion of immigrant children, who generally scored lower than German children on all MSS subtests (ps < .001), did not
change the results substantially shown in Table 2. Differences in vocabulary, grammar, articulation, and total score remained significant on the MSS (Zs  -2.55,
ds  -0.09, p s  .49, ps  .011), while differences in speech comprehension
on the MSS were barely statistically significant (d = -0.06, p = .49, p = .051,
N = 2,146 males, 2,133 females). Effect sizes remained almost the same (Table 2).

As shown in Tables 3 and 4, the same linguistic domains and the two additional repetition tasks (i.e., sentences and nonce words) that examined short-term
phonological memory were assessed for Samples 2 and 3.
In most tests, girls showed numerically better performance than boys. Four of
these differences (speech comprehension, pronunciation, repetition of sentences,
and total MSS score) were statistically significant in Sample 2, and two (speech
comprehension and repetition of nonce words) were significant in Sample 3,
though again with small effect sizes.
Sex differences in mean values among three age groups in Sample 2

In Sample 2, for children aged 3 years, girls scored significantly higher than boys
on the MSS subtest for articulation (Z = -2.33, p = .02, d = -0.30, p = .41,
N = 113 males, 111 females). Concerning the MSS subtest for vocabulary, the
difference was statistically significant by a slim margin (Z = -1.93, p = .053, d =
-0.26, p = .42, N = 114 males, 109 females). Among children aged 4 years, girls
significantly outperformed boys on the MSS subtests for articulation, repetition of
sentences, and nonce words, as well as in terms of total MSS score (Zs  -2.02,
ps  .044, p s  .48, ds  -0.09, Ns  1,004 males, 835 females). However,
the sample size was considerably larger, and the effect sizes were minimal. For
5-year-old children, no significant differences were found (ps  .270). The median
of the effect size values (Cohen d) of differences between boys and girls in terms
of MSS scores was -0.3 for 3-year-olds (girls scored higher) as well as -0.1 for
4-year-olds and 0.0 for 5-year-olds, which indicates that sex differences decreased
with age.
Sex differences according to language experts' judgments and
questionnaires

Poorer results for male participants are reflected in the greater proportion of boys
classified as requiring educational support (e.g., language courses) according to
the judgments of expert panels based on results of two of the three samples:
Samples 1 and 2: 2 s (1)  5.26, ps  .022, Ns  1,407 males, 1,181 females;
Sample 3: p = .114. Furthermore, in all three samples, the proportion of boys who
stuttered according to the university language experts was significantly greater
than that of girls (1.6%-6.7% for boys, 0.6-2.8% for girls), 2 s (1)  3.87, ps 
.049, Ns  338 males, 306 females. The judgment on stuttering was based on the
audio records of the test situation (Samples 1 and 3), judgments of language testers
(MSS item "stuttering: yes/no"; Samples 1 and 2), and questionnaires for parents
(Samples 2 and 3) and for daycare center teachers (Samples 1 and 2). In addition,
boys in all age groups were judged to show language impairments, pathologies,
and disorders significantly more often than girls, according to parental report (see
Demographic and Sociolinguistic Characteristics of the Samples section).
Though very few significant differences emerged in this respect according
to the questionnaires, in all three samples boys were classified by university
language experts as requiring medical examination significantly more often than
girls, 2 s (1)  6.57, ps  .010, Ns  363 males, 319 females. This result indicates

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6
Lange et al.: Sex differences in language competence

1429

that expert panels assumed, based on language tests including audio records and
questionnaires, that children could have an illness, impairment, or disorder that
harmed their language development. This does not mean, however, that these
children had a diagnosed language-related medical issue. Furthermore, boys were
more often in speech and language therapy according to the questionnaires from
all three samples, 2 s (1)  6.94, ps  .008, Ns  397 males, 362 females.
However, according to both testers and questionnaires, in no sample did boys have
a voice disorder significantly more often than girls (ps  .084). Voice disorder
was defined as a frequently or permanently hoarse voice. Dichotomous items on
the hoarseness (yes/no) were included both in MSS (Samples 1 and 2) and in
questionnaires for parents (Samples 2 and 3).
Some clues regarding sex-specific differences can be extracted from the questionnaires, in which parents and daycare center teachers provided additional information concerning the language development of the children tested. No sex
differences emerged for three variables, namely, that everybody could understand
what the child says, that the child can speak in complete sentences, and that, if
not German speaking, then the child speaks his or her native language normally.
However, boys were described significantly more often than girls as being unable
to speak German appropriately according to their age: Sample 2: 2 (1) = 6.35,
p = .012, N = 316 males, 287 females; Sample 3: p = .157. Boys were also
more often reported to have communication or speech comprehension problems,
2 (1) = 9.70, p = .002, N = 149 males, 114 females; to not understand questions
and requests: Sample 2: 2 (4) = 12.43, p = .014, N = 818 males, 689 females;
Sample 3: p = .546, or sophisticated tasks, 2 (4) = 17.18, p = .002, N = 617
males, 481 females; to not have an age-appropriate vocabulary, 2 (4) = 18.58,
p = .001, N = 476 males, 359 females, or pronunciation, 2 (4) = 19.98, p =
.001, N = 478 males, 363 females; and to be unable to use articles properly, 2
(4) = 9.94, p = .041, N = 610 males, 476 females.
Only one finding supported the assumption that girls speak out more often
than boys. Boys were less talkative in groups than were girls according to a
questionnaire from Sample 2 completed by daycare center teachers (item "The
child speaks out during group activities" from the questionnaire for daycare center
teachers), 2 (4) = 12.04, p = .017, N = 484 males, 374 females. Neither in
Sample 1 nor in Sample 2 were significant sex differences on MSS tasks for
spontaneous speech found (ps  .606).
It is possible that the differences found between boys and girls in the subjective
(questionnaires) and objective (language tests) assessment of language skills could
have been influenced by the lower compliance shown by boys than by girls in the
test situation. The compliance values (good, average, and poor) of boys were
significantly lower than those of girls in all three samples, 2 s (2)  6.82, ps 
.033, Ns  421 males, 384 females.

Sex differences in variance

The result that boys were described by parents, daycare center teachers, and
university language experts as suffering from language abnormalities more often

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6
Lange et al.: Sex differences in language competence

1430

compared to girls might be linked to the expected greater variance among males
than among females in verbal proficiency.
Higher male than female variance in verbal proficiency was measured objectively based on total number of correct answers in the language tests. Only total
scores from the MSS and S-ENS, including the S-ENS add., the tests which examined all important linguistic domains (i.e., speech comprehension, vocabulary,
grammar, phonological short-term memory, and pronunciation), were used for
examining differences in variance between boys and girls.
Our data show that boys demonstrated significantly greater variance than girls
regarding total MSS performance in both Sample 1 (SD = 8.97 vs. 8.49), F (3,115,
3,026) = 33.30, p < .001, and Sample 2 (SD = 12.85 vs. 12.14), F (1,100, 923)
= 9.63, p = .002, but not for the S-ENS, including the additional tasks in Sample
3 (SD = 8.89 vs. 8.68), F (355, 313) = 2.67, p = .103. We also examined the
proportion of the sexes in the lower and upper tails of the distribution by sorting
participants into three different groups according to their total MSS score, namely,
the upper 10% and lower 10%, with 80% in the middle. The sex differences within
these groups were significant, 2 (2) = 37.82, p < .001, which resulted from the
overrepresentation of boys in the lower tail (1.41 boys to 1 girl). Furthermore,
girls were overrepresented in the upper tail (1.42 girls to 1 boy) of the distribution.
The overrepresentation of boys in the lower tail and of girls in the upper tail also
surfaced in terms of the lower and upper 5% and the lower and upper 3%.
DISCUSSION

In the current study, we examined sex differences in the language development of
German preschool children, primarily aged 4-6 years. In accordance with previous
research (Bornstein et al., 2004; Hayiou-Thomas et al., 2012; Wallentin, 2009),
we found a slight female advantage over boys in several linguistic domains. As
previous research also suggests, this sex difference seemed to vanish around school
age (i.e., 6 years).
The relatively small developmental sex differences in verbal abilities found
could be explained, for instance, by sex-different maturational rates. Females
seem to mature faster than males, especially at young ages, and early maturation
is correlated with better verbal abilities (Galsworthy et al., 2000; Waber, 1976).
Accordingly, language-related sex differences seem to be affected by biological
factors, as can be observed by referring to genetic aspects (see below), as well
as to hormonal effects. Transsexuals, for instance, experience a large decrease
in performance in verbal fluency tests after androgen therapy (Kimura, 2000).
Women seem to have greater verbal abilities (e.g., verbal fluency) in the middle of
their menstrual cycle, when progesterone and estradiol levels are high (Halpern,
2000; Hampson & Kimura, 1988; Kimura, 2000).
More important for our purposes, sex differences in language acquisition
can also be partially caused by hormones. Albores-Gallo, Fernandez-Guasti,
Hernandez-Guzman, and List-Hilton (2009) found that prenatal testosterone, measured via second-to-fourth digit ratios (2D:4D), was negatively correlated with
vocabulary development in preschoolers. In a similar vein, Lange (2015) reports
correlations between 2D:4D and performance in language comprehension and

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6
Lange et al.: Sex differences in language competence

1431

verbal interaction in German kindergarteners, in that high 2D:4D ratios (i.e., low
prenatal testosterone) were positively correlated with language performance. As
such, fetal testosterone could explain boys' disadvantages, and thus girls' advantages, in lexical acquisition, as findings by Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, and Raggatt
(2002) have also shown. These authors found that girls have larger vocabularies
than boys when aged 18-24 months, an advantage that is negatively correlated
with fetal testosterone. Consequently, Lutchmaya et al. (2002) assume that fetal
testosterone partially shapes neural mechanisms. More precisely, testosterone is
likely responsible for advanced development of the right hemisphere in males,
which could facilitate deficits and pathologies in the left hemisphere, where language functions are concentrated (Geschwind & Galaburda, 1987; Lust et al.,
2010). However, it is also possible that a high level of estradiol, and not necessarily a low level of testosterone, is associated with better language development
(Wermke, Hain, Oehler, Wermke, & Hesse, 2014). The question that remains is
why sex differences in mean values vanish around the age of 6 years. To claim that
this vanishing contradicts biological explanations would neglect the very nature
of biological factors, which are well known to work differently depending on age
(e.g., puberty). The vanishing sex difference might still be explained by biological
factors (e.g., maturational factors). Still, it might also be that around 6 years of
age, which is strikingly the age when the children in our sample enter school,
specific social factors increasingly take the reins with the result of a similarity of
boys and girls in language skills. Future research needs to focus on identifying the
biological and social factors (and their interaction) that cause this approximation
of the sexes regarding language skills.
Along with sex differences according to means, we also assessed sex differences
according to variance. Based on both theoretical and empirical work, we assumed
that boys would be more variable than girls in their language competence. Ultimately, this assumption was mostly supported by our data. Our results suggest that
boys could simply be overrepresented among children with poor verbal abilities.
This does not mean that low test scores are necessarily equivalent with language
impairment.
That boys show greater variance than girls but are overrepresented only at
the lower tail of the distribution could be explained by slightly greater female
means. Taking former research (e.g., Eriksson et al., 2012) into consideration
while interpreting our data, it is possible to conclude that sex differences in
variance emerge around the age of 3 years.
As to why variance among males is greater than among females, reference
to only social factors falls short of a sufficient explanation. Social factors cannot solely and consistently cause greater phenotypic variance among males than
among females because this pattern can be found at young ages, which complicates explaining it only by environmental variables (Arden & Plomin, 2006; Ardila
et al., 2000). Furthermore, if social factors could explain sex differences in variance, then for boys a broader variety of social factors than for girls, that is, more
or more diverse environmental factors, would have to be assumed. This seems unlikely. However, it cannot be ruled out that boys and girls differ on multiple social
factors or that the same factors influence both sexes differently. Especially the latter argument, however, does not contradict biological explanations. Furthermore,

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6
Lange et al.: Sex differences in language competence

1432

the biological causation of language-related pathologies, which constitute one
side of sex differences in variance, is evident (Alarcon et al., 2008; Dworzynski,
Remington, Rijsdijk, Howell, & Plomin, 2007; Hayiou-Thomas, 2008; Jenkins,
2000; Stromswold, 2001, 2005). Moreover, such language pathologies are highly
heritable in early life (Dale et al., 1998; Hayiou-Thomas et al., 2012), and sexspecific genetic factors responsible for language and language deficits have been
reported. Galsworthy et al. (2000) conducted a study with children aged 3 years in
order to identify sex-specific genetic factors in language development. They concluded that heritability of verbal abilities is greater in males than in females and
that the etiology of vocabulary development might also differ between the sexes,
thereby indicating sex-specific genetic factors regarding verbal abilities. This conclusion was based on a difference in correlations between dizygotic same-sex and
dizygotic opposite-sex twins.
It is more notable that the results showing greater variance among males corroborate findings regarding the evolutionary psychology of sex differences in general
and the evolution of language in particular. From an evolutionary perspective,
it can be assumed that a greater phenotypic variance among males than among
females mirrors the larger reproductive variance in males compared to females
(Archer & Mehdikhani, 2003; Lange, 2012; Lange, Zaretsky, Schwarz, & Euler,
2014). Sex differences in variance have been reported for somatic traits as well
(Lehre, Lehre, Laake, & Danbolt, 2008), which also undermines explanations
citing environmental factors. Sex differences in variance, in which males show
greater variance, are reflected in sex differences in reproductive strategies (Archer
& Mehdikhani, 2003), in reproductive variance (Brown, Laland, & Borgerhoff
Mulder, 2009), and, as reported above, in heritability (Galsworthy et al., 2000).
Nevertheless, further research is needed to explain why linguistic sex differences
in variance exist and why they seem to emerge only around the age of 3 years
(Eriksson et al., 2012).
A greater variance in language development among males than among females
and a greater overrepresentation of males among children with a rather poor
language acquisition, respectively, pose practical implications. It suggests that
more boys may need to be offered educational support and, if necessary, special
intervention regarding language. Though several biological factors influencing
verbal abilities and high heritability estimations for verbal abilities have been
reported, at least one third of variance in several verbal abilities is explained by
environmental factors (Stromswold, 2001, 2005), thus suggesting that intervention
can have an effect.
Because our database included numerous demographic variables, we could
confirm that no major sex differences regarding extra- or sociolinguistic variables
appeared that could have confounded our results. Our samples, at least Sample 1,
could furthermore be deemed unselected. We therefore conclude that the findings
regarding sex differences are valid. However, our effect sizes were relatively small,
and statistical significance was thus found only due to relatively large sample sizes.
Simply put, the sexes are more alike than they are different (Zell et al., 2015).
Future studies should aim to replicate our findings by focusing on sex differences in variance, which seems to be a neglected field of research compared to
research on sex differences according to mean values. Further research should also

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:6
Lange et al.: Sex differences in language competence

1433

seek to identify the causes of sex differences in language development. For sex
differences in mean values, both social (e.g., sex-different rearing) and biological
factors (e.g., prenatal testosterone and sex-different evolutionary selection pressures) seem to be possible explanations. Regarding sex differences in variance,
genetic or chromosomal factors on a proximate level and evolutionary selection
pressures linked to reproduction on an ultimate level (Archer & Mehdikhani,
2003; Lange, 2012) might be worth further examination, but social/sociolinguistic
factors should also be taken into consideration.
