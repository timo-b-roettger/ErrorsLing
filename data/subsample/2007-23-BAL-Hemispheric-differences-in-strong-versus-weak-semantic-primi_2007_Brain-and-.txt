Abstract
Goals: Research with lateralized word presentation has suggested that strong (``close'') and weak (``remote'') semantic associates are
processed differently in the left and right cerebral hemispheres [e.g., Beeman, M. j., & Chiarello, C. (1998). Complementary right- and
left-hemisphere language comprehension. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 7(1), 2-8]. Recently, this hypothesis has been challenged [Coney, J. (2002). The effect of associative strength on priming in the cerebral hemispheres. Brain and Cognition, 50(2), 234-241].
We predicted that foveal presentation of strong and weak associates would elicit different patterns of hemispheric activity, as indexed by
high-density event-related brain potentials (ERPs), and that source localization of the scalp potentials would help clarify the nature of
hemispheric contributions to semantic organization.
Methods: 128-channel ERPs were recorded in two experiments as subjects performed a lexical decision task. Word trials were equally
divided into strongly related, weakly related, and unrelated word pairs. All words were foveally presented. SOA was 800ms in Experiment 1, and 200ms in Experiment 2.
Results: Topographic analyses revealed medial frontal (MFN) and parietal (N400/LPC) effects for both strong and weak associates.
Between 450 and 550 ms, the magnitude of the N400/LPC effect indicated priming for both strong and weak associates over left parietal
sites, while priming over right parietal sites was restricted to strongly related word pairs. During this interval, spatiotemporal source
modeling showed that these scalp effects were best accounted for by ipsilateral sources in the medial temporal lobe. The observed pattern
of asymmetries for strong versus weak associates is not consistent with certain proposals regarding the complementarity of right- and
left-hemisphere contributions to semantics. It is, however, consistent with findings from visual half-field studies (Hasbrooke and Chiarello, 1998). We discuss the relevance of these results for theories of hemispheric asymmetry and meta-control in lexical semantic access.

1. Introduction
When two word meanings are related in memory, activation of one meaning in response to a visually presented
prime word facilitates subsequent access to a related (target) word meaning. This facilitation or priming manifests
as improved speed or accuracy in response to related targets, as compared with an unrelated or ``neutral'' baseline
condition (Neely, 1991). The semantic priming effect has

been observed across a range of tasks (e.g., lexical decision,
pronunciation, semantic categorization) and has proven to
be an important tool for probing the nature of language
and cognition, resulting in a large corpus of semantic priming data in psychology of language and related fields
(Hutchison, 2003; Neely, 1991).
Despite the widespread interest in semantic priming,
some basic questions remain unresolved. One key question
is how strength of association (or semantic distance)
between concepts affects the nature of semantic priming
within and across the two hemispheres. Are strongly and
weakly related word pairs processed similarly in the left
and right cerebral cortex, or are there qualitative differences

in how the two hemispheres process strong (``close'') versus
weak (``distant'') semantic relationships?
Two prevailing responses to this question have emerged.
According to one view--referred to here as the Complementarity Hypothesis--strong and weak associates should
evoke different patterns of activity over the left and right
hemispheres, reflecting qualitative differences in left and
right hemisphere processing of semantic information. For
example, Chiarello, Beeman, and associates have argued
that weakly (or ``remotely'') related word meanings are
processed more easily in the right hemisphere, which functions to maintain a wide range of meanings, while the left
hemisphere can support priming of both strong and weak
associates at short SOAs, but mainly supports strong
semantic priming due to meaning selection (focused attention) at later time points (see Beeman & Chiarello, 1998 for
a review).
An alternative view is that strong and weak associates
engage the very same cognitive and neural processes, and
any differences in strong and weak priming are strictly
quantitative, rather than qualitative, in nature (Coney,
2002). Thus, according to this position, which is referred
to here as the Equivalence Hypothesis, strong and weak
associates should be processed similarly by the two
hemispheres.
To address this issue, the present study measured highdensity event-related potentials (ERPs) to semantic associates that varied in strength of association (i.e., strong,
weak, and unrelated word pairs). Two experiments were
performed, using a lexical priming paradigm and two
prime-target SOAs to examine time course of hemispheric
priming effects. The basic logic was that if strong and weak
associates elicited different patterns of lateralized brain
activity, this would support the Complementarity Hypothesis. On the other hand, if the same spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity were observed, this result would be
more consistent with the Equivalence Hypothesis. Because
the topography of scalp ERPs does not point directly to
underlying patterns of brain activity, a spatiotemporal
dipole method was used to generate a neural source model
of left and right hemisphere activity in strong versus weak
semantic priming.
1.1. Mechanisms of semantic priming
Studies of semantic priming have revealed multiple
mechanisms that may influence activation and retrieval of
word meanings in different contexts (Hutchison, 2003;
Neely, 1991). According to one influential theory of semantics, semantic priming can arise through automatic spreading activation (ASA), a process by which activation of one
concept automatically spreads to related (``linked'') concepts. On this view, word meanings are conceptualized as
nodes within a Hebbian network: related concepts are connected via links, and the strength of a particular semantic
relationship is represented by the ``distance'' between nodes
(Collins & Loftus, 1975; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971).

Activation of one semantic node will therefore spread to,
or activate, related nodes in memory. This process is ``automatic'' in the sense that it can occur in the absence of
executive control processes that require effort and awareness (Posner & Snyder, 1975). In addition to ASA,
researchers have identified several types of non-automatic
or controlled semantic processing (Neely, 1976, 1977,
1991; Posner & Snyder, 1975; Shiffrin and Schneider,
1977), including postlexical ``matching'' and verification
strategies (Becker, 1980), and semantic integration (e.g.,
Brown & Hagoort, 1993).
Given that multiple mechanisms have been implicated in
semantic processing, it is not surprising that research is
uncovering a widespread network of areas that are active
during meaning comprehension and that vary as a function
of task parameters, such as degree of associative strength
or SOA (Braeutigam, Bailey, & Swithenby, 2001; Frishkoff,
Tucker, Davey, & Scherg, 2004; Rossell, Price, & Nobre,
2003). A current challenge is to parcellate these areas according to function, and to clarify when and how these different
mechanisms operate to give rise to semantic priming.
1.2. Hemispheric asymmetries in semantic processing
Some prior research has reported differential patterns of
hemispheric asymmetry in response to strong and weak
semantic relationships, in support of the Complementarity
Hypothesis (e.g., Beeman & Chiarello, 1998). According to
Beeman and Chiarello, weakly (remotely) related word
meanings appear to be preferentially processed by the
right, as opposed to the left, hemisphere, while the left
hemisphere appears to support priming of either strong
or weak associates, depending on the time course (but cf.
Koivisto, 1997).
A now-classic study by Burgess and Simpson (1988) provided evidence for hemispheric differences in time course,
as well as distance or strength, of semantic processing. In
this experiment, Burgess and Simpson examined semantic
distance effects in the two hemispheres using ambiguous
primes (e.g., ``bank'') that were followed by words encoding either the dominant or the subordinate meaning of
the prime word (e.g., MONEY versus RIVER). To examine hemispheric contributions, target words were presented
to either the left or right visual field, and SOA was varied
to map the time course of hemispheric differences in priming. At a short (35 ms) SOA, the two meanings showed
similar facilitation in the RVF/LH, but only the dominant
meaning was activated in the LVF/RH. Conversely, at a
long (750 ms) SOA, the subordinate meaning was suppressed in the RVF/LH, but showed equivalent or greater
facilitation than the dominant meaning in the LVF/RH.
These results are consistent with the idea that the LH
may initially activate both meanings, but that the subordinate meaning is later suppressed. By contrast, dominant
meanings appear to be primed in the RH at short SOAs,
but then decay at longer SOAs, just as the subordinate
meaning is becoming more activated over the RH.

G.A. Frishkoff / Brain and Language 100 (2007) 23-43

On the other hand, data from Coney (2002) has suggested that strong and weak associates evoke similar patterns
of priming in the two hemispheres. Coney examined priming of words that were strongly, moderately, or weakly
associated; word pairs were presented to the right or left
visual field, and SOA was varied (250 versus 1000 ms).
As expected, he observed a linear decrease in reaction time
with increases in associative strength. Moreover, responses
to related words were faster over the RVF/LH, and priming effects were somewhat stronger at the long SOA.
Importantly, however, there was no interaction between
associative strength and visual hemifield, and no interaction between hemifield and SOA. These results cast some
doubt on the existence of qualitative differences in priming
of strong and weak associates as a function of time course
and hemispheric asymmetry.
1.3. Measures of semantic association: Strength, relatedness
and ``distance''
The hypothesis that strong and weak associations
should evoke qualitative differences in brain activation
rests on the idea that different cognitive processes support
activation of close (or strong, focal) versus remote (or
broad, diffuse) semantic relationships. The very concept
of semantic ``distance'' between concepts is implicit in
models of spreading activation. Indeed, in their original
formulation of the spreading activation model, Collins
and Loftus (1975) suggested that related concepts are
``stored close together'' in psychological and neuronal
space. This metaphorical description in turn raises important questions about how to operationalize the notion of
semantic ``distance'' and about the theoretical assumptions
implicit in the use of different measures.
One common measure of distance considers the number
of intervening concepts between prime and target (so-called
direct versus indirect associative ``links''). The use of direct
and indirect associates assumes a model of spreading activation in which activation of concept A results in automatic spreading of activation (ASA) to related concepts.
Assuming that activation is allowed to spread across multiple related concepts (``nodes''), this implies that activation
of A can lead to activation of concepts that are not directly
associated with A: i.e., A ) B ) C, Thus, A primes C, even
though A and C are not directly associated. An example of
an indirect association is `lemon'-`sweet,' where the intermediate link is the word `sour' (Kiefer, Weisbrod, Kern,
Maier, & Spitzer, 1998; Weisbrod, Maier, Harig, Himmelsbach, & Spitzer, 1998, 1999). The strength of this indirect
priming will depend on a decay function: how quickly activation decreases over time and ``distance.''
Work by McNamara (1992) and by Spitzer and associates (Kischka et al., 1996; Moritz et al., 2001; Spitzer,
Braun, Maier, Hermle, & Maher, 1993; Weisbrod et al.,
1998, 1999) has demonstrated qualitative, as well as quantitative, differences in the processing of direct and indirect
associates. Most important for the present discussion, Kie-

25

fer et al. (1998) observed differences in lateralization of
ERP priming effects for direct versus indirect semantic
associates: Whereas direct associates elicited a negativity
over bilateral inferior prefrontal sites, indirect associates
elicited only a right hemisphere negativity over lateral inferior prefrontal sites. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that ``close'' (direct) and ``remote'' (indirect)
semantic associations engage the two hemispheres in qualitatively different ways. Thus, studies using direct and indirect priming suggest possible differences in the distance or
scope of semantic priming between the two hemispheres.
An alternative is to characterize semantic distance in
terms of associative strength, where strongly related concepts are considered to be closer in conceptual-semantic
space (e.g., de Groot, Thomassen, & Hudson, 1982; Rodel,
Cook, Regard, & Landis, 1992). Strength of association
can be quantified through empirical measures, such as discrete free association (Nelson, McEvoy, & Schreiber, 1998)
and relatedness ratings. In comparison with direct/indirect
associates, the use of strong and weak associates has several advantages. First, associative strength has intrinsically
more gradations: whereas direct/indirect priming extends
to two or three levels at most, strength of association can
be defined on a continuous scale. Through the use of parametic (item) analyses, this approach can in turn provide a
more powerful test of hypotheses regarding semantic distance (cf. Dien, Frishkoff, Cerbone, & Tucker, 2003). Second, associative strength is a more transparent measure. As
underscored by the work of McKoon and Ratcliff (1992), it
is not obvious how indirect associates can be distinguished
from weak associates: words such as `lemon' and `sweet'
may be assumed (on intuition) to have no direct association, but this can be difficult to verify empirically. On the
other hand, strength of association can be measured in several ways, but the notion that some words are more strongly associated than others rests on solid footing: studies of
learning and memory over the past several decades have
shown many effects of varying the strength of association
between words and concepts (Coney, 2002; Deese, 1965;
de Groot et al., 1982; Rodel et al., 1992).
Finally, the construct of associative strength may be
more theoretically neutral. It is not necessary to maintain
that associative strength is isomorphic with ``distance in
semantic space''; effects of associative strength may be
equally compatible with other theories of semantic priming, such as those based on distributed semantic architectures (McRae, Cree, Westmacott, & de Sa, 1999; McRae,
de Sa, & Seidenberg, 1997).
1.4. Goals of the present research
Given the hemispheric asymmetries observed for direct
and indirect priming in previous research an important
question is whether strong and weak associates show a similar pattern that would point to qualitative, as well as quantitative, differences for strong and weak semantic priming.
To examine this question, two experiments were conducted,

26

G.A. Frishkoff / Brain and Language 100 (2007) 23-43

in which high density (128-channel) ERPs and behavioral
measures were recorded as subjects read words (targets) presented on a computer screen. Targets were preceded by single
words (primes) that were either semantically related or unrelated to the target words, where degree of relatedness was
varied parametrically. Experiment 1 used a relatively long
SOA (800; 200 ms interword interval). The long interword
interval (IWI) was selected to minimize overlap of the ERPs
to the prime and target stimuli, permitting easy identification
of the major spatiotemporal components of the response to
the target. At the same time, the 800 ms SOA allowed for
multiple influences on semantic priming, including forward-acting expectancy for the target (Neely, 1991). Experiment 2 used a comparatively short SOA (200; 50 ms IWI) in
order to minimize the role of expectancy (cf. Hill, Strube,
Roesch-Ely, & Weisbrod, 2002; Rossell et al., 2003).
Although the short IWI resulted in overlap of the ERPs to
the prime and target, the prediction was that ERP results
from Experiment 1 would provide a blueprint for interpreting condition differences in Experiment 2. In addition, the
use of long and short SOAs would permit us to examine
the time course of priming for strong and weak associates,
as measured by different ERP components.
One advantage of ERP measures is that hemispheric differences can be detected even with centrally presented stimuli. An important limitation of visual half-field studies is
that they separate hemispheric differences in semantic processing under the unusual conditions of initial input being
isolated to one hemisphere's visual cortex. By contrast, the
present study employed used foveal, i.e., bilateral visual
field, presentation of words, with the rationale that words
are typically foveated during normal reading processes
(Reichle & Perfetti, 2003), and that hemispheric asymmetries in processing would be observable in asymmetric patterns of electrophysiological activity. An important caveat
is that the lateral distribution of scalp-recorded ERPs does
not point unequivocally to neural generators in a particular
region: a right-lateralized distribution can be due to either
a left or right hemisphere generator. For this reason, in the
present study traditional scalp ERP analyses are complemented by the use of spatiotemporal dipole modeling,
using the methodology detailed in Frishkoff et al. (2004).
This approach allows us to examine intensity of activation
in right versus left cortical regions with millisecond time
resolution and provides a way to parcellate the multiple
stages and processes involved in lexical semantic priming.
2. Experiment 1
2.1. Methods
2.1.1. Subjects
Fifty participants were recruited from introductory
courses in Psychology at the University of Oregon. Subjects were native English speakers who were right-handed,
with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Academic
course credit was given in exchange for participation. Five

subjects had two few good EEG trials after artifact rejection; three additional subjects had excessive alpha or frontal EMG. This left 42 subjects (20 male; mean age = 19.7,
SD = 3.1; 24 with at least one left-handed relative) who
generated sufficient quality EEG data for further analysis.
2.1.2. Stimuli
The same set of stimuli was used in Experiments 1 and 2
(Table 1). Stimuli consisted of 400 prime-target pairs, presented one stimulus at a time. Letters were black, 26 dpi,
presented foveally on a white screen; letter strings subtended a visual angle 2.44 and 4.57. Primes appeared in lower
case, targets in upper case. Targets were either real words
or pseudowords (i.e., pronounceable non-words), matched
with real-word targets for length and orthographic set size.
Primes were either real words or ``neutral'' strings of hash
marks (######). See below for a discussion of issues
regarding the use of the ``neutral'' prime condition.
All real-word stimuli were nouns, chosen to be concrete,
familiar, three to six letters in length (mean = 4.61), and
medium-to-high frequency (mean log #occurrences per
million words, from Kucera-Francis norms = 3.33). Stimuli were matched across the strong, weak, and unrelated
conditions in mean word length. Strong associates (targets)
had a slightly higher mean log frequency--strong
ln (101) = 3.70 (SD = 1.46)--as compared with weakly
associated and unrelated targets--weak ln (47) = 3.20
(SD = 1.15), and Unrelated ln (53) = 3.10 (SD = 1.25).
The difference in mean log frequency of strong versus weak
just missed significance (p = .058). The difference between
strong and unrelated was significant at p < .05.
Although the `######' prime condition was included
as a ``neutral'' baseline, to permit separation of facilitory
and inhibitory effects, comparison of the ERP response in
the ``neutral'' and word-prime conditions suggested differences in visual (P1 and N1) components, which are too early to show semantic effects (cf. Fig. 6). This result supports
the arguments by de Groot (de Groot et al., 1982) and others that `######' is not valid as a semantically neutral
prime. For this reason, the `######' prime condition
was not included in analyses presented here.
2.1.3. Measures of associative strength
Real-word prime-target pairs were further divided into
strong, weak, and semantically unrelated pairs (n = 50
per condition). Associative strength was determined from
two normative databases: the Nelson association norms
(Wilson, 1988) and the Edinbourgh Associative Thesaurus
(Kiss, Armstrong, Milroy, & Piper, 1973). The two measures were highly correlated (r = .86) for this stimulus set.
Strong semantic associates were defined as word pairs that
had a forward (prime-to-target) associative strength of .20
or higher according to the Nelson norms (mean = .57) and
.10 or higher according to the Edinbourgh norms
(mean = .41). Weak associates had a mean forward
strength of .03 (Nelson norms), or .04 (Edinburgh norms).
Unrelated word pairs had zero associative strength. In

choosing related word pairs, we excluded collocations and
pseudo-compounds (e.g., peanut-BUTTER, text-BOOK)
from the stimulus set. Analysis of variance for the associative strength norms revealed a strong difference in average
associative strength between the three categories, F (2,
149) = 482, p < .001. Planned comparisons showed that
the strong and weak associates were significantly different
(p < .001); the difference between the weak and unrelated
categories approached significance (p = .069).
Nelson et al. (1998) have acknowledged shortcomings of
the free association procedure. Most important in the current context, free association norms tend to underestimate
the strength of directly associated words that are not the
dominant response (e.g., weak semantic associates),
because subjects generate only one response to each prime
word. To address these concerns, we also collected relatedness norms, using a Likert-type scale (e.g., Kutas and Hillyard, 1989; Thompson-Schill et al., 1998). The main
advantage of rating procedures is that they appear less
likely to underestimate the strength of weak associations.
We therefore examined more closely the strength of association between words in the ``weak'' category, using relatedness ratings acquired from 44 subjects during a group
``prescreening'' session for introductory courses in Psychology at the University of Oregon. Twenty-two subjects rated
the strength of association between words for 75 (out of
150) word pairs (there were roughly equal numbers of
strong, weak, and unrelated word pairs); the remaining
22 subjects rated the associative strength of the remaining
75 words. For each word pair, subjects were instructed to
``indicate the degree to which you think the words are related in meaning.'' We then computed the mean relatedness
rating for each experimental category (strong, weak, unrelated). A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed
that mean relatedness rating was significantly different
across the three categories: F (2, 149) = 9.67, p < .001. As
expected, differences between weak and unrelated word
pairs were highly significant (p < .001), confirming that
the associative strength norms do underestimate degree of
relatedness for weakly related prime-target pairs.
2.1.4. Experimental task
Each session began with a block of 15 practice trials.
The main task consisted of eight blocks of 100 trials each.
A trial began with the presentation of a rectangular outline,
which cued the subject to initiate the experimental sequence

when ready by pressing both the right and left buttons
simultaneously using their right and left index fingers. Subjects were informed that it was not important to press both
buttons in synchrony, but that they should press both buttons to begin each trial. This procedure was designed to
avoid differential priming (due to activation of motor and
premotor cortex) of the left or the right hemisphere on
the initiation of each trial.
Once the subject initiated a trial, a central fixation (``+''
symbol) appeared for 500 ms. Next, a word (the prime) was
presented foveally, followed after a short interval (ISI) by a
second word (the target). The stimulus-onset asynchrony
(SOA) in Experiment 1 was 800 ms (prime duration
600 ms, ISI 200 ms). During the intertrial interval, subjects
were permitted to blink or move. If subjects were aware of
moving their head or facial muscles between trials, they
were asked to count slowly to 10 to allow the amplifier
to recover before using the response keys to advance to
the next trial.
Trials were randomly presented (order determined separately for each subject). The subject's task was to respond
``as quickly and as accurately as possible'' whether the target stimulus was a real English word or not. ``Yes'' and
``no'' (right versus left) keys were counterbalanced across
subjects. Response time and accuracy were recorded simultaneously with the EEG measures.
2.1.5. ERP data acquisition and preprocessing
ERPs were recorded using either a 128-channel electrode
array, with vertex recording reference. Data were sampled
at a rate of 250 per second and were amplified with a .01Hz highpass filter (time constant  10 s). Trials were edited
offline for eye blinks and head movements. The remaining
trials were segmented into 2500 ms epochs, starting
1000 ms before onset of the target word. Segmented data
were averaged across trials (within subjects and within condition) and digitally filtered with a 30-Hz lowpass filter.
Channels were automatically marked bad for a given trial if blinks or eye movements were detected, if amplitudes
>150 lV, if differential average amplitude (i.e., changes in
slope) >75 lV, if the channel was flat (had zero variance),
or if manual inspection suggested noise specific to that
channel (i.e., not affecting surrounding channels). Any
channel marked bad for more than 20% of the total trials
was interpolated based on data measured at near-by electrodes. Subjects with more than 10 bad channels or with

28

G.A. Frishkoff / Brain and Language 100 (2007) 23-43

fewer than 15 clean EEG trials in any one of the experimental conditions were excluded from further analysis (five
subjects met these criteria and were excluded).
The cleaned data were re-referenced to the average of
the recording sites, and were baseline corrected 200 ms prior the target word. Grand-averaged data were used for
inspection of waveforms and topographic plots.
Reaction times were measured from the onset of the target stimulus. Responses faster than 200 ms or slower than
2000 ms were excluded. Only correct responses entered into
the final analyses.
2.1.6. Statistical analyses
For statistical analyses of behavioral and ERP data, we
performed a series of fully factorial ANOVAs, one for each
dependent measure of interest (reaction time, accuracy,
MFN amplitude, etc.). Each analysis included Relatedness
(three levels: strong associates, weak associates, and unrelated word pairs) as an independent variable. Recall that
the `######'--prime condition was excluded from this
analysis, since preliminary analyses suggested that it was
not a valid ``semantically neutral'' condition, suggesting
that inclusion of this condition would complicate interpretation of semantic priming effects.
For the ERP variables of interest (N3, MFN, N4, and
LPC), we added spatial variables where appropriate (based
on previous research). The channel sets that are used in
these analyses are shown in Appendix A. To maximize
the stability of the ERP measures, we averaged over the
channels for each component (e.g., rather than selecting
the minimum or maximum for further analysis). While this
procedure can weaken effects due to the variability in distribution of effects across conditions and across subjects, it
captures patterns that are more stable and more reliable
in distribution across subjects and conditions, and there-

fore avoids results due to spurious effects at a single
channel.
2.1.7. Source localization
A spatiotemporal approach was used to fit symmetrical
pairs of regional sources to the data over the 1000-ms poststimulus epoch by seeding the sources at random starting
locations and allowing the sources to converge to the
region of maximum goodness of fit in the time range when
each pair has maximum activity, as determined from the
power plot. Minimum distance criterion was set to
8.7 mm, and the regularization constant was set to 2%.
We specified an ellipsoidal head model with four homogeneous shells: brain, CSF, skull, and scalp (Berg & Scherg,
1994). Conductivity ratios were 1 (CSF), 0.3300 (brain),
0.0042 (skull), and 0.3300 (scalp). Thicknesses were 1 mm
(CSF), 7 mm (skull), and 6 mm (scalp). Head radius was
set to 92.5 mm.
We used regional source analysis (implemented in
BESA) to derive the source model for Experiment 1
(Frishkoff et al., 2004; Scherg & Von Cramon, 1985),
and then fit the same model to the data in Experiment
2 to test for replicability. The model contained symmetric sources in occipital cortex (28, 76, 9), medial
temporal cortex (16, 45, 15), inferior temporal cortex
(30, 32, 20), inferior frontal gyri (20, 14, 17),
and orbitrofrontal/rostral anterior cingulate (17, 41,
6). An additional source was located in dorsal anterior
cingulate (2, 13, and 24). Fig. 1 shows the source
locations.
The model accounted for better than 99% of the variance in both datasets. To check for model stability, each
pair of sources was refitted within the interval of maximal
power while the remaining sources were held constant (cf.
Frishkoff et al., 2004).

As shown in Fig. 1, the source waveforms show separable peaks, suggesting that there are no ``meaningless,'' or
silent, sources. Ideally, there should further be little or no
interference between separate sources. The distinct patterns
in the source waveforms suggest that this is generally the
case for the present model. One exception is that there is
interference between medial temporal and occipital sources
that is evident at around 100-180 ms (during the P1/N1
interval). Critically, however, there is little or no change
in source intensity of the MT source when the occipital
source is turned off during the focus (300-600 ms) interval,
and vice versa (not surprising, since the occipital sources
show little activity during this interval).
For statistical analysis of condition effects for each
source, a series of repeated-measures ANOVAs was conducted separately on each of the sources. The dependent
measure was the amount of regional activation for each
source, computed as the root-mean-square (RMS) activation, averaged over 50-ms intervals. Based on the scalp
topographic analyses, we restricted the analysis to 8 series
of 50-ms intervals, from 200 to 600 ms (the N400 interval).
Although there were later condition effects (>600 ms), we
focus here on effects during the central, N400 time interval,
when semantic priming has been shown to elicit ERP
effects in many previous studies (Kutas & Federmeier,
2000; for review).

2.2. Results
2.2.1. Behavioral results
Table 2 displays means and standard deviations for the
behavioral responses (RT and accuracy) in each of the five
experimental conditions for Experiment 1.
2.2.2. Reaction time data
There was a main effect of semantic priming, F (2,41) =
25.01, p < .001. Paired contrasts indicated that responses to
strongly related words were significantly faster than to
weakly related words (p < .001). Responses to weakly related words were faster than to unrelated words, but the effect
did not reach significance (p > .07). The mean difference in
RT between strongly related and unrelated word pairs was
61 ms (SD = 68 ms); the difference for weakly related versus unrelated word pairs was 17 ms (SD = 61 ms). Thus,
priming for strongly related words was approximately
three times the magnitude of the priming effect for weakly
related pairs.
2.2.3. Accuracy data
In general, subjects were highly accurate on the lexical
decision task (mean accuracy = 98%, SD = 2%). Priming
effects on accuracy were small, but reliable, F (2,41) =
33.27, p < .001. Subjects were least accurate on the unrelated

trials, and most accurate in response to strongly related
words. Paired t tests indicated that the differences in
accuracy between strong and weak associates and between
weak and unrelated associates were both significant
(p < .001).
2.3. ERP results
We adopted the traditional procedure of first identifying
multiple features of the ERP (''components''), and subsequently treating each component as a dependent variable
in an analysis of variance. On the basis of previous research
(e.g., Bentin, Mouchetant-Rostaing, Giard, Echallier, &
Pernier, 1999; Frishkoff et al., 2004; Hill et al., 2002), we
identified seven such components--that is, spatiotemporal
features of the ERP that have consistently been observed
in studies of word processing, and are thought to reflect
distinct neural and functional (sensory-perceptual and/or
cognitive) processes. These components included the P100
(peak  120 ms), N100 (peak  195 ms), N3 (peak  250 ms),
frontal P2 (peak  300 ms), MFN (peak  350 ms), N400
and LPC responses (these last two are characterized below
in greater detail). Peak latencies were measured across time
windows based on previous ERP studies of visual word
processing (e.g., Frishkoff et al., 2004).
The waveforms in Fig. 2 illustrate several condition
differences.
First, an effect of Relatedness is observed between 300
and 400 ms over fronto-central electrode Fcz (channel 6):
The negative deflection (MFN) is largest to the unrelated
targets, smallest to strongly related targets, and in between
for weakly related word pairs. Second, over parietal electrode Pz, there is a condition difference between 350
and 500 ms (the ``N400 effect''). This condition difference
may be ascribed to two separate effects, as suggested in previous studies (Hill et al., 2002): (a) a negativity peaking at
around 400 ms (the N400), which is stronger to unrelated
words over parietal sites and shows inversion over frontal
sites (the so-called P400); and (b) a positivity (LPC), which
is delayed to the unrelated word (LPC latency shifting).
The N400 amplitude effect is hard to disentangle from this
latency difference, since the N400 and LPC components
share a similar topography and time course. We have
addressed this issue using a delayed-probe task in a separate experiment, reported elsewhere (Frank & Frishkoff,
2006).
2.3.1. Visual evoked potentials: 0-200 ms
A typical P1-N1 complex was observed over occipital
electrodes between 0 and 200 ms after target onset. The
P1 peaked at 120 ms, and the N1 at 195 ms, consistent
with previous studies of visual evoked potentials to word
stimuli (Compton, Grossenbacher, Posner, & Tucker,
1991).
Inspection of both the waveforms and topographic plots
suggested that the occipital P100 response was larger over
the right hemisphere, as in prior studies of word processing

(e.g., Compton et al., 1991; Frishkoff et al., 2004). Consistent with this observation, analyses of variance showed a
reliable hemispheric effect, F (1, 41) = 17.81, p < .001. The
N100 tended to be more pronounced over the left hemisphere, but this difference did not reach significance
(p > .20).
There were no significant differences in latency of the P1
and N1 components as a function of hemisphere or semantic condition.
2.3.2. Ventral temporal negativity (N3): 250-350 ms
In previous ERP studies of visual word processing, we
have described a sequence of negative deflections that
begins with the late N1 (or ``N2'') over left temporal-occipital regions of the scalp (200 ms) and then becomes progressively more anterior, terminating in an anterotemporal negativity at around 300-350 ms, which is
typically left-lateralized and more pronounced for words
that are strongly expected or primed (Frishkoff et al.,
2004; cf. Marinkovic et al., 2003 for similar results using
MEG). We refer to this temporal negativity as the N3.
Dien et al. (2003) tentatively localized the posterior N3 to
left inferior temporal cortex (BA 20). In the present
experiment, the first semantic effects were observed during
the N3 interval (cf. Nobre & McCarthy, 1994).
Analyses of variance confirmed that N3 amplitude was
affected by semantic relatedness, F (2, 82) = 5.68, p < .001.
As observed in previous studies (e.g., Dien et al., 2003;
Nobre & McCarthy, 1994), amplitudes were more negative
for related versus unrelated words. This effect was further
clarified by an interaction of Relatedness and Caudality--F (2, 82) = 6.39, p = .003: Priming effects were seen
only over posterior temporal regions. Interestingly, effects
were seen over both the right and left hemispheres
(no effect of Hemisphere), although the negativity appears
left-lateralized in the topographic maps (not shown here).
2.3.3. Medial frontal negativity: 300-400 ms
A second priming effect was observed over medial frontal areas, peaking at around 330-350 ms (the MFN effect).
In contrast with the N3 priming effect, MFN amplitudes
were more negative for unrelated versus related targets:
main effect of Relatedness, F (2, 82) = 16.57, p < .001.
The topographic t maps in Fig. 3A illustrate the development of the MFN effect from 250 to 350 ms for strong
and weak semantic priming. These ``t maps'' represent
interpolated scalp maps of Student's t values, computed
at each electrode site (n = 129) for each time point
(n = 200). The color palette has been scaled to reflect only
those effects that exceed an uncorrected threshold of
p = .0000004, which corresponds to a Bonferroni-corrected
threshold of p = .01. Note that this correction procedure is
actually more conservative than needed, since the multiple
comparisons are not truly independent (cf. Dien et al.,
2003).
The MFN effect begins as a focal negativity in the unrelated condition at 250 ms. At 275 ms, the effect spreads

to more caudal medial frontal sites, and by 360 ms, the
effect begins to encompass more posterior (parietal) sites,
as the P300/LPC begins to develop in response to related

words (the N400/LPC effect). Similar to the N3 priming
effects, the MFN priming effect is larger for strong versus
weak semantic associates. In addition, the priming effects

for weak associates appear to extend less rostrally than the
effect for strong associates--although this may reflect a
quantitative rather than a qualitative difference in frontal
activation.
2.3.4. Parietal N400/LPC effect: 350-550 ms
About 50 ms after onset of the MFN effect (starting
at  360 ms), the well-known parietal ``N400 effect'' emerges over centroparietal sites, and lasts until 500 ms
(Fig. 3B).
The N400 effect begins as a centromedial effect at
350 ms, but is resolved as a more lateral effect over temporo-parietal sites by 500-520 ms. Interestingly, the priming effect for strong semantic associates terminates over left
and right lateral regions; whereas weak semantic priming is
only observed over left lateral sites during this later epoch.
To capture this shift in topography over the N400 epoch,
we divided the N400/LPC epoch into two early and late
time windows. In the earlier (350-450 ms) window there
was a main effect of Relatedness (p < .001), but no effect
of Hemisphere (p > .6; Fig. 4A). The interaction between
Relatedness and Hemisphere did not approach significance
(p > .5). In the later (450-550 ms) N400/LPC interval, an
interaction effect emerged between Relatedness and Hemisphere, F(2, 41) = 4.96, p = .009. As shown in Fig. 4(B),
there was greater priming over the left hemisphere, with a

2.3.5. Summary of results from Experiment 1
In summary, results from Experiment 1 showed a difference in hemispheric distribution of the late N400 effect for
strong versus weak associates, providing some support for
our initial prediction. However, these effects were not consistent with a simple model of left hemisphere specialization for focused, and right hemisphere support for
diffuse, meaning: the results showed weak associates were
primed only over the left hemisphere, whereas strong associates were primed over both hemispheres (with stronger
priming over the left side).
This pattern of results is similar to those observed by
Hasbrooke and Chiarello (1998) in a visual half-field
study of semantic priming, in response to dominant
and subordinate target meanings of an ambiguous prime
word. They observed priming of both dominant and subordinate meanings in the left hemisphere (i.e., with right
visual field presentation), but priming only of the dominant meaning in the right hemisphere (left field presentation). Hasbrooke and Chiarello proposed that this
pattern of results may reflect hemispheric interaction.
When the primes were presented bilaterally, the pattern
of facilitation appeared similar to left hemisphere/right
visual field presentation, suggesting that in normal (bilateral) reading, the left hemisphere exerts metacontrol over
semantic processing.
One question is whether the relatively long SOA of
Experiment 1 allowed time for hemispheric interaction to
influence the pattern of hemispheric activity in relation to
semantic priming effects. To clarify these effects, Experiment 2 sought used a short (200 ms) SOA to determine
whether this effect would still be observed under conditions
that are likely to minimize effects of forward ``expectancy''
for the target (de Groot et al., 1982; Neely, 1976, 1977,
1991), and thus the exertion of metacontrol by the left
hemisphere over the right.
3. Experiment 2
3.1. Methods
Methods were identical to those in Experiment 1, except
that the prime-target SOA was 200 rather than 800 ms
(150 ms prime; 50 ms ISI). Sixty-two subjects were run in
the experiment. One session was aborted due to equipment
failure, six datasets had too few trials after rejection of artifacts (<20 per cell), and eight subjects had data that were
otherwise noisy due to excessive alpha, EMG, or blink
recovery artifacts. The 47 remaining subjects were all
right-handed, average age 19.9 (SD = 2.9). Thirteen
(28%) were male; 26 (55%) had at least one left-handed
relative in their immediate family.
Data were baseline-corrected to 200 ms before the prime
word. Otherwise, the same preprocessing and analyses

3.2.1. Behavioral results
Table 2 displays means and standard deviations for the
behavioral responses (RT and accuracy) in each of the five
experimental conditions for Experiment 2.
3.2.2. Reaction time data
There was a main effect of Relatedness, F (2,46) =
209.30, p < .001. Paired contrasts indicated that responses
to strongly related words were significantly faster than to
weakly related words (p < .001), and responses to weakly
related words were faster than to unrelated words
(p < .001).
In contrast with Experiment 1, priming of weak associates was highly significant (mean difference = 63 ms,
p < .001).
3.2.3. Accuracy data
The accuracy results for Experiment 2 almost precisely
replicated the effects in Experiment 1. Accuracy was very

high (mean = 98%). Nonetheless, there was a significant
effect of Relatedness, F (2, 46) = 23.33, p < .001. Responses
was reliably more accurate for strongly versus weakly related targets (p < .001), and for weakly related versus unrelated targets (p < .001).
3.3. ERP results
With the temporal overlap of the ERPs to the prime and
target stimuli, it is more difficult to isolate individual components in Experiment 2 versus Experiment 1. With this
caveat in mind, we applied the same metrics that were used
to define the components in Experiment 1.
Comparison of the waveforms from Experiments 1 and
2 (Figs. 2 and 5) reveals similar patterns overall, despite
several differences in waveform morphology. An effect of
semantic relatedness is visible in channel Fcz: The MFN
is enhanced to the unrelated relative to the related words
at 350 ms. Parietal electrodes show the N400/ LPC effects
seen in Experiment 1, and the ``P400'' effect (greater positivity to unrelated words) is evident over frontal electrodes
(cf. Johnson & Hamm, 2000; Frishkoff et al., 2004). Fig. 5
shows ERP waveforms to the target word for a subset of
channels.

3.3.1. Visual evoked potentials: 0-200 ms
Fig. 6 shows the P1-N1 complex (visual evoked potentials) to the prime and target stimuli in Experiments 1
and 2. Note that the P1-N1 to the target in Experiment 2
is attenuated in comparison with the evoked potentials to
the prime word. This is consistent with prior evidence that
sensory potentials are refractory: stimuli presented in rapid
succession elicit smaller and smaller potentials, possibly
because the neuronal response takes time to recover (e.g.,

Boddy, 1986). In addition, the P1 and N1 to the target have
less defined peaks in Experiment 2, suggesting latency jitter
(increased variability from trial to trial), which can also
lead to reduced amplitudes (e.g., Spencer, Vila Abad, &
Donchin, 2000).
Despite component overlap, the pattern of response for
the P1 and N1 components in Experiment 2 largely replicated the results from Experiment 2. The topography of
the P100 to the target (330 ms after onset of the prime

differed in amplitude (p = .002 for weak versus unrelated,
and p < .001 for strong versus weak).
Fig. 7A shows the t maps of the strong and weak MFN
priming effects. The strong semantic priming effect was
more pronounced and somewhat more sustained; otherwise, MFN priming for strong versus weak associates
was similar in timing and spatial distribution.

and 2 (bottom). Black line, response to targets following word primes.

3.3.4. Parietal N400/LPC effect: 350-500 ms
Between 350 and 400 ms, the t maps begin to show the
well-known N400 effect over parietal sites (Fig. 7B). As in
Experiment 2, the spatial distribution of this effect is similar for strong and weak associates in the early part of the
epoch: it starts out bilateral, focused around Cz (380-
400 ms), and then shifts to a left parietal focus by
450 ms. By around 500 ms, however, priming of strong
associates is still seen over right-hemisphere electrodes;
whereas for the weak associates, the effect is only seen over
the left hemisphere.
To capture the shift in topography of the parietal
``N400'' effect, analyses of variance were conducted separately for the early (350-450 ms) and later (450-550 ms)
epochs, as in Experiment 1. As in Experiment 1, there
was a strong Relatedness main effect (p < .001) in the earlier (350-450 ms) window; however, the effect of Hemisphere (p > .3), and there was no hint of an interaction

word), shows a slight right lateralization, which fell short
of significance (p = .15).
By the time of the N1 to the target word, the P300/LPC
to the prime began to develop over parietal sites, making it
hard to discern the topography of the N1 response. A main
effect of hemisphere was observed, F (1, 41) = 6.72, p = .01.
According to this analysis, the N100 was larger (more negative over the right hemisphere) when defined with respect
to the preceding positivity. However, given the asymmetry
of the P1 (more positive/less negative over the right hemisphere), this may be artifactual.
3.3.2. Ventral temporal negativity (N3): 250-350 ms
The N3 semantic effect seen in Experiment 1 was replicated in Experiment 2: Main effect of Relatedness, F (1,
92) = 3.81, p < .05. Related targets were more negative
over this interval than unrelated words. The interaction
Relatedness * Caudality approached significance: F (1,
92) = 3.02, p = .08. As in Experiment 1, the semantic effect
was seen mainly over posterior temporal regions.
3.3.3. Medial frontal negativity: 300-400 ms
The MFN peaked a little earlier in Experiment 2 (342 ms
versus 357 ms at the 800 ms SOA). The priming effect
observed in Experiment 1 (800 ms SOA) was replicated
for the short (200 ms) SOA: F (1, 46) = 12.20, p < .001.
Post hoc comparisons showed that all three conditions

between Relatedness and Hemisphere (p > .7; Fig. 4C). In
the later (450-550 ms) N400/LPC interval, an interaction
effect emerged between Relatedness and Hemisphere, F (2,
92) = 4.14, p = .019 (Fig. 4D). As in Experiment 1 the
priming effect was strongest over the left hemisphere, and
this asymmetry was especially pronounced for the weak
associates.
3.3.5. Summary of results from Experiment 2
In summary, the progression of semantic relatedness
effects--from the left-lateral N3 to the medial frontal
MFN to the parietal N400/LPC--was replicated in Experiment 2 (200 ms SOA). Importantly, the same pattern of
hemispheric asymmetry for strong versus weak associates
was also seen in both experiments.
4. Meta-analysis: Semantic relatedness * SOA
To examine differences in time course of strong and
weak semantic priming, we treated SOA as a between-subjects variable, and combined the data from Experiments 1
and 2.
4.1. Behavioral analyses: Relatedness * SOA
Analyses of reaction time showed a main effect of Relatedness, F (2, 87) = 116.33, p < .001. There was no main
effect of SOA (p > .2). However, the interaction between
Relatedness and SOA was highly significant, F (2,
87) = 11.34, p < .001. Strong associates were facilitated relative to weak associates at both SOAs (p < .001); however,
weak associates were facilitated relative to unrelated words
only at the short SOA.
4.2. ERP analyses: Relatedness * SOA
Analysis of N400 peak latency revealed main effects of
Hemisphere--F (1, 87) = 31.91 p < .001--and SOA, F (1,
87) = 11.50, p = .001. The N400 component emerged earlier over the left hemisphere and was also earlier at the
longer (800 ms) SOA. The earlier N400 latency over
the left hemisphere is consistent with previous N400
source analyses (Frishkoff et al., 2004). The same SOA
pattern (earlier N400s at the long versus short SOAs)
has also been reported in previous studies (Hill et al.,
2002; Rossell et al., 2003).
Analysis of mean amplitude over the early (350-450 ms)
and late (450-550 ms) windows revealed several important
effects. As expected, there was a main effect of Relatedness
in both epochs (p < .001). In the early epoch, there were no
effects of either Hemisphere or SOA, and no interaction
effects. In the later epoch, however, there was a main effect
of Hemisphere, F (1, 87) = 4.63, p = .034: priming was
greater over the left versus right hemisphere, and this effect
was consistent across SOA (i.e., Experiments 1 and 2). In
addition, the meta-analysis revealed an interaction between
Relatedness and Hemisphere, F (2, 174) = 7.82, p = .001.

Planned comparisons showed that the difference between
strong and weak associates over right-hemisphere electrodes was significant, t (87) = 2.15, p = .034; by contrast,
the difference over the left hemisphere was non-significant
(p > .7). The ERP response to weak associates was more
positive than the response to unrelated targets, and this
effect was significant over both right- and left-hemisphere
electrodes (p 6 .001), although the magnitude of this effect
was much greater over the left hemisphere (D = .96) as
compared with the right hemisphere (D = .41). Taken
together, these results suggest that effects observed in the
t-maps--bilateral effects for strong priming, and left-lateral
priming for the weak associates between 450 and 550 ms--
are indeed reliable. There was no three-way interaction: the
same pattern held at the long and short SOAs. There was a
modest two-way interaction, however, between Relatedness and SOA, F (2, 174) = 3.00, p = .052. Paralleling the
reaction time analysis, N400 priming was somewhat larger
in amplitude at the short SOA.
4.3. Source localization results
It is well-known that scalp topography is not transparent: a difference over the right lateral region of the scalp
could plausibly be generated by a source in either right
or left cortex. To address this ambiguity, we turned to spatiotemporal source analysis, focusing on differences in neural source activation for strong versus weak associates
between 450 and 550 ms, the time when hemispheric differences for strong and weak semantic priming was observed
in both experiments.
For analysis of amplitude effects, the root mean square
(RMS) was calculated over the key (450-550 ms) interval
for each regional source. RMS values were then submitted
to a 3 (Relatedness) * 2 (Hemisphere) * 2 (SOA) Analysis
of Variance. As summarized in Table 3, there were two
regional sources that showed significant interactions
between semantic relatedness and hemisphere: one pair of
sources was located in the posterior inferior frontal gyri
(IFG), and the other pair was in medial temporal cortex
(MT).
Post hoc comparisons for the IFG sources showed a
large difference in mean amplitude of strong and weak
associates over the left but not the right hemisphere,
accounting for the interaction effect. However, subsequent
analysis showed this interaction was seen only at the shorter (200 ms) SOA (three-way interaction significant,
p < .05). Furthermore, the scalp projections for these two
sources consisted of focal anterolateral negativities, with
peak latency 500 ms over the left hemisphere and
515 ms over the right hemisphere (averaged across
SOA). The topographic distribution of these components
was therefore incompatible with the posterior distribution
of the N400/LPC effect, although this pattern may be related to differences in activation of left IFG for strong and
weak associates that have been reported in the imaging literature (e.g., Fletcher, Shallice, & Dolan, 2000).

Next we examined the MT activations. Paired comparisons revealed a difference in activation for strong and weak
associates within right, but not left, temporal cortex
(p = .002 for the right-hemisphere source, but p > .1 for
the left-hemisphere source; Fig. 8A). This suggests that
the right-hemisphere differences between strong and weak
associates observed on the scalp could be linked to differences in activation within right temporal cortex. The difference in response to weakly related versus unrelated targets
was significant in both the right and left hemispheres
(p < .001).
Although these results clarified the origin of the scalp
effects, the overall pattern remained puzzling: why should
strong associates elicit stronger right-hemisphere priming,
when compared with weak associates? Given the relatively
long latency of these effects (500 ms), we suspected that
differences in time course, as well as amplitude, of neural
activity might account for the differential responses to
semantically related versus unrelated word pairs. As discussed previously, the lexical decision paradigm is known
to elicit a strong decision-related LPC response that overlaps both spatially and temporally with the N400 (Curran,
Tucker, Kutas, & Posner, 1993). Previous studies have
shown that the LPC is delayed to words that are less
expected or less primed. Perhaps the hemispheric differences for strong and weak priming were linked to contralateral

ACC (#correct)

differences in LPC latency, rather than N400 amplitude, for
strong versus weak associates.
To explore this possibility, we examined the peak
latency of activity within right versus left MT for each
semantic category (see Fig. 8B for average peak latencies
right versus left MT activation for each lexical category).
Consistent with our prediction, MT latency showed a
main effect of Relatedness, F (2, 87) = 20.61, p < .001:
post hoc comparisons showed that strong and weak
latencies were both shorter than the latency to unrelated
words (p < .001 for both). Further, although the omnibus
test failed to show an interaction between Relatedness
and Hemisphere (p > .3), the t-tests revealed an difference
for strong versus weak associates: the MT response to
weak associates in the left hemisphere peaked nearly
30 ms later than to strong associates (p = .007), while
the 9 ms difference for strong versus weak associates in
the right hemisphere did not approach significance
(p > .3).
Model A (top panels in Fig. 9) illustrates the latency
hypothesis. If activation is delayed over the left hemisphere, as an inverse function of relatedness (so that strong
associates peak earliest, and unrelated words show the longest delay), at point * (marked by the arrow in Fig. 9, top
two panels), strong priming will only be slightly greater
than weak priming. By contrast, if there is little or no

priming. Middle, actual (grand-average) source wave forms in left and right MT (200 ms SOA). Bottom, Actual (grand-average) source wave forms in left
and right MT (800 ms SOA).

latency shifting over the right temporal region, strong
priming will remain significantly greater than weak priming
at this same time point. The temporal patterns of activation
in MT for the short SOA (middle panels, Fig. 9) and for
the long SOA (bottom panels, Fig. 9) do show some hint
of latency differences that are consistent with this hypothesis (cf. Fig. 8, right panel, for differences in peak
activation).
However, further analyses showed that the latency differences in left MTL were not correlated with the right-lateral priming effects for strong and weak associates (p > .9).
Rather, it was the amplitude effects in right MTL (strong
versus weak) that were associated with the right-lateral differences between strong and weak associates on the scalp
(r = .33, p < .05). Thus, the scalp effects appear to stem
from differences in magnitude of activation for ipsilateral
sources in MTL, and not to the alternative model illustrated in Fig. 9.

5. General discussion
Since the inception of priming research, researchers have
been curious about the time course and scope of semantic
priming: how far and how fast does activation spread from
one concept to another? The objective of the present
research was to characterize behavioral and ERP effects
of associative strength (or semantic ``distance''), and to
examine hemispheric differences in strong and weak semantic priming as a function of SOA. In contrast with most
research on hemispheric differences in semantics, words
were presented foveally. While hemifield presentation has
some analytical advantages (Federmeier & Kutas, 1999),
foveation is characteristic of normal reading (Binder, Pollatsek, & Rayner, 1999). Therefore, it is of considerable
interest to know whether hemispheric differences in activation can be seen in ERP measures of semantic priming to
foveal stimuli. Moreover, we reasoned that if hemispheric

G.A. Frishkoff / Brain and Language 100 (2007) 23-43

differences in processing of strong and weak associates are
robust, they should be detectable using ERP measures of
foveal words: while RT measures can confound multiple
effects, these effects may be distinguishable in the form of
latency or topographic differences in the ERP (i.e., as distinct ERP ``components'').
5.1. Left-hemisphere and midline frontal activations
Prior to the hemispheric effects observed over temporoparietal areas (laterality differences significant from 450 to
550 ms), we observed two earlier frontal effects, a negativity over left anterior regions of the scalp (the N3,
peak  250 ms) and a medial frontal negativity (the
MFN, peak  350 ms). The N3 was found to be more negative to related word pairs, consistent with previous
research (e.g., Frishkoff et al., 2004; Nobre & McCarthy,
1994). The N3 topography is consistent with the scalp projection for the left inferior frontal (LIFG) source in our
regional source model. Further, statistical analyses of the
grand-averaged source waveforms for the LIFG source
showed an interaction between target and laterality (Table
2). Post hoc tests revealed stronger activity for strong targets compared with unrelated and weak targets, from
400 to 500 ms, over the left hemisphere only. One puzzling aspect of this finding is that strong associates evoked
more activity than weak associates over LIFG. This result
is opposite from what is typically observed in fMRI studies
of strong versus weak priming (e.g., Fletcher et al., 2000).
Given the course spatial resolution of the EEG source
localization, these disparate findings may simply represent
different functional anatomical effects. Nonetheless, it will
be important to reconcile these results in future studies.
A subsequent medial frontal negativity (MFN) was
observed at 350 ms: Like the better-known N400 effect,
MFNs were more negative to unrelated versus related
words, and MFN priming was greater for strongly versus
weakly related word pairs (associative strength or ``distance'' effect). Interestingly, MFN amplitudes were more
negative across all conditions at the long SOA. Given the
timing and topography of the MFN response, it may be
related to the feedback negativity observed in studies of
performance monitoring (Luu, Flaisch, & Tucker, 2000)
and to the medial frontal response observed to negatively
valenced words that is seen in studies of self-evaluation
(Tucker, Luu, Frishkoff, Quiring, & Poulsen, 2003). Both
of these medial frontal negativities have been localized to
the anterior cingulate, consistent with their focal distribution over medial frontal electrodes. In addition, we found
increased medial frontal activation at the long SOA: this
result is consistent with Rossell et al. (2003), who showed
greater ACC activity in semantic priming at long versus
short SOAs. They interpreted this as evidence for an
increased role of attention and ``controlled processing'' at
the long SOA, consistent with previous evidence for the
role of ACC in executive control processes (Luu & Tucker,
2003). Of course, direct manipulations of expectancy and

39

attention, such as the use of different relatedness ratios in
addition to SOA, would provide stronger evidence on the
effects of attention on amplitude of the MFN (cf. Neely,
1991). As a tentative hypothesis, we interpret the MFN discrimination of strong, weak, and unrelated words to reflect
an early semantic process organized within medial frontal
regions that appears to influence the developing representation of meaning within posterior hemispheric networks (cf.
Frishkoff et al., 2004).
5.2. Left versus right posterior activations
Inspection of the topographic ``N400 effect'' in the t-test
animations suggested an early, medial parietal component
that appears to reflect differential onset of the parietal
(and possibly posterior cingulate) N400/LPC effect and a
later, more lateral temporal component that was particularly sustained over left temporal regions. It is this later
temporal component that appears to reflect priming for
both strong and weak associates in the left hemisphere,
but only for strong associates in the right hemisphere (Figs.
3B and 7B). To separate these effects, we subjected the data
to spatiotemporal source modeling, to examine both the
timing and extent of activation in the two hemispheres,
and to clarify the interaction between laterality and strong
versus weak semantic priming that was observed on the
scalp surface.
Sources in right and left posterior medial temporal lobe
(MTL) showed interactions between hemisphere and
degree of associative strength. The MTL source projections
were consistent with the N400/LPC scalp pattern of activity (cf. Frishkoff et al., 2004; Johnson & Hamm, 2000). Differences in both amplitude and peak latency of the source
waveforms were observed, with an intriguing result: while
activation peaked later for less related targets over the left
hemisphere, there was no latency effect over the right
hemisphere.
Furthermore, subsequent analysis of the source waveform effects showed that scalp asymmetries for weak associates (i.e., LH > RH priming) were due to ipsilateral
differences in magnitude of activation within the MTL. By
contrast, there was no correlation between priming effects
observed over posterior lateral scalp sites and latency differences between conditions for contralateral MTL sources.
Thus, the scalp effects appear to reflect activity of ipsilateral
temporal lobe networks, rather than a projection of source
potential fields to the contralateral hemisphere.
5.3. Implications for theories of hemispheric asymmetries
and semantic distance effects
The pattern of asymmetries observed here does not support the simple version of the Complementarity Hypothesis,
which posits that the left hemisphere is specialized for processing of close associates (by means of focused attention),
while the right hemisphere supports a broader range of
semantic relationships (e.g., Burgess & Simpson, 1988; Chi-

40

G.A. Frishkoff / Brain and Language 100 (2007) 23-43

arello, Burgess, Richards, & Pollock, 1990). However, the
pattern of results we observed is very similar to results
obtained by Hasbrooke and Chiarello (1998). As in the
present studies, Hasbrooke and Chiarello found priming
of both dominant (strong) and subordinate (weak) concepts when targets were presented to the left hemisphere
(right visual field), whereas right hemisphere (left visual
field) priming was restricted to dominant (strong) meanings. They suggested a post hoc explanation of these
results, to account for the discrepancies with the original
data from Burgess and Simpson (1988). According to Hasbrooke and Chiarello, subjects in their study failed to
resolve the ambiguity of the prime word. This would
account for the equivalent priming of strong and weak
associates over the left hemisphere. In addition, they propose that right-hemisphere maintenance of weak (or subordinate) meaning may depend on input from the left
hemisphere (e.g., a signal that meaning selection has
occurred, and the subordinate meaning should be kept
around in case the initial semantic selection needs to be
revised). If the absence of this input, activation of weak
(subordinate) concepts may have decayed by 750 ms.
On the one hand, the present paradigm does not lend
itself easily to the Hasbrooke and Chiarello interpretation.
In the present case, there was no lexical ambiguity to
resolve: prime and target words were selected to represent
unambiguous, but related meanings. Furthermore, the
results from Experiment 2 in our study are difficult to
square with the views of Hasbrooke and Chiarello and with
the hypothesis that weak priming onsets later in the right
hemisphere (e.g., Burgess & Simpson, 1988). If Hasbrooke's and Chiarello's interpretation of their data is correct, activation of weak associates should be observed early
(perhaps < 300 ms) in the right hemisphere, and not at later
SOAs. Data from Experiment 2 of the present study are
not consistent with this prediction: the same pattern of
asymmetric priming for strong versus weak associates
was observed at the short (200 ms) and longer (800 ms)
SOAs. One possibility is that activation of weak associates
begins early and decays rapidly without input from the left
hemisphere; however, this would run contrary to the idea
that right-hemisphere priming of remote associates onsets
later and is relatively sustained (e.g., Burgess & Simpson,
1988).
The similarity of the Hasbrooke and Chiarello visual
half-field results with the present data are nonetheless
intriguing. Whatever, the correct interpretation, the data
suggest that strong and weak associates are not processed
equivalently in the two hemispheres: two separate experiments revealed differences in hemispheric asymmetry, with
right-hemisphere priming for strong associates only, and
left-hemisphere activation of both strong and weak associates. Therefore, the Equivalence Hypothesis is clearly not
supported by these results.
Recent theories of hemispheric differences in semantic
processing have considered other issues that may be related
to the Complementary Hypothesis, such as local versus dis-

tributed representations in single-word processing (Deacon
et al., 2004), and differences in message-level processing of
meaning, e.g., expectancy versus integration (Federmeier &
Kutas, 1999). The exact nature of hemispheric differences
in semantic processing is therefore still under investigation.
5.4. Limitations and future directions
The stimulus set used in these experiments was constrained in several ways: only medium-to-high frequency,
concrete, familiar nouns were used. Target stimuli were
matched in word length across the three categories (strong,
weak, and unrelated). Unfortunately, as described in the
Methods, there was a small but reliable difference in word
frequency across the stimulus categories: strongly related
targets were higher frequency, in general, than weakly related and unrelated targets. This confound limits the generality
of the findings; it will be important to replicate the pattern of
results with strictly matched stimulus pairs in future work.
Another limitation of the current paradigm is the use of
the lexical decision task. Paradigms that require an overt
response have several advantages: they provide behavioral
data that can help guide interpretation of ERP results and
permit some experimental control over the subject's task
set and strategies. On the other hand, it is well-known that
any task that evokes decision-related processing of the target will result in a strong pattern of late positivity over
centroparietal areas (the LPC). This pattern of activity is
difficult to separate from the N400 negativity, which has
a similar time course and topography. Future studies of
ERP effects for strong versus weak priming should therefore consider how to obtain improved separation of
N400 and LPC components (cf. Frank & Frishkoff, 2006).
It is also important to acknowledge that the use of
equivalent dipoles has both pros and cons relative to alternative methods, such as distributed source solutions. One
issue concerns the indeterminacy in number of dipoles
(see Michel et al., 2004 for discussion of this problem). Several solutions to this problem have been proposed, including the use of data reduction procedures, such as Principal
Components Analysis (PCA) or Independent Components
Analysis (ICA) (e.g., Wang, Berg, & Scherg, 1999). These
methods are not without their own set of issues, however
(Dien & Frishkoff, 2004; Frank & Frishkoff, 2006 to
appear). Inverse source modeling procedures--such as
minimum norm (MN) and low-resolution electromagnetic
tomography (LAURA) algorithms--can be used to circumvent the problem of determining the number of dipoles
that are needed to fit the data (Michel et al., 2004). However, these procedures lack the parsimony of equivalent
dipole methods, which represent a complex set of spatiotemporal data in terms of a relatively small set of anatomical sources that are associated with distinct source
waveforms (time course profiles). Recently, some hybrid
procedures have been proposed, which combine the
parsimony of equivalent dipole methods with the improved
anatomical accuracy of distributed source models (e.g.,

G.A. Frishkoff / Brain and Language 100 (2007) 23-43

Daunizeau et al., 2006). It will be important to consider the
advantages and disadvantages of these recent techniques in
future work.
A further caution regarding the present source solution is
that anatomical accuracy is limited by the use of a grand-average model, which has not been adjusted to reflect individual subject differences in anatomy (e.g., variations in
cortical geometry, which affects the orientation) of dipoles.
The use of RMS (root-mean-square) amplitude mitigates
this problem to some extent, by collapsing across dipole orientation. Nonetheless, further work will be needed to detail
individual differences that are not captured in a grand-average source model such as the one presented here.
The present set of results suggests several possible directions for future research on hemispheric differences in
semantic processing. One question is how earlier, frontal
activity in semantic priming (N3/MFN scalp patterns;
LIFG/ACC sources) may be related to later, temporo-lateral activity (the N400/LPC; medial temporal and temporoparietal sources). Indeed, hemispheric asymmetries in
semantics have been explicitly linked to differences in
employment of frontal attention networks (e.g., Nakagawa, 1991). Given the importance of attention in language
and cognition, it will be critical to understanding the relationship between frontal and posterior cortical activity and
the interaction between caudality and hemispheric asymmetries in semantics. Our working hypothesis is that the
N3/LIFG indexes early semantic selection (cf. Dien et al.,
2003), while the MFN/ACC is part of a domain-general
process related to familiarity detection (cf. Curran, 2003).
Inhibition is one important mechanism for exerting
attentional control during meaning selection. In this
regard, it may also be important to separate the contributions of facilitory and inhibitory mechanisms underlying
the asymmetries in strong and weak semantic priming.
Typically, a so-called ``neutral prime'' condition is included
as a baseline for measuring facilitation (calculated as Related--Neutral) versus inhibition (calculated as Unrelated--
Neutral). The present studies included a so-called
``neutral'' (##### prime) condition. However, early differences in visual response for the and non-neutral conditions
(Fig. 6) underscores why the so-called ``neutral'' condition
(string of X's) is not an appropriate semantic baseline. Given that the P1 and N1 components are thought to reflect
early, exogenous processes, we would not predict semantic
effects during the P1-N1 interval. The larger P1-N1
response to targets following neutral versus non-neutral
primes is therefore suspect, pointing to differences between
the neutral and non-neutral conditions that are likely to be
non-semantic. Future studies should therefore include an
alternative baseline, such as the word ``blank'' (cf. Dien,
Franklin, & May, 2005).
Finally, it will be important to replicate these results
using hemifield methods, to permit integration of ERP
results with the behavioral research on hemispheric asymmetries in semantic processing. Given the complexity of
previous findings in this literature, and recent progress in

41

functional mapping of ERP components, the use of ERPs
may help clarify the cognitive and neural bases of hemispheric contributions to semantic organization.
