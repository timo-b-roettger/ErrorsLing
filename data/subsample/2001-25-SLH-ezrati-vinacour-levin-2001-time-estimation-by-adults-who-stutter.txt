In view of the fact that stuttering involves time pressure in communicative contexts,
the aim of this investigation was to study the effect of stuttering on time estimation.
Two matching groups of 47 adults each, one consisting of stutterers and the other
of fluent speakers, estimated the duration of four verbal tasks--two that involved
speaking and two that did not. Two methods of time estimation were used:
production and reproduction. In production, participants were required to
perform a task, terminating it when they felt that the specified interval had
elapsed. In reproduction, participants were asked to estimate the duration of a
task immediately after being stopped by the experimenter. The results reveal that
the differences in time estimation between adults who stutter and fluent speakers
were task dependent, with the stutterers estimating time less accurately on oral
verbal tasks. The conversation task in particular highlighted the inaccuracy of
their time estimation. Furthermore, severe stutterers estimated time less accurately
than mild stutterers. The greatest inaccuracy was displayed by severe stutterers
when estimating the time of an oral task by the production method. The results are
discussed in terms of cognitive models based on attention to time, method
measurement, and mental workload. Clinical implications are also suggested.

he phenomenon of stuttering is typically described as consisting of
three features: (1) abnormal motor speech; (2) affective reactions,
primarily negative emotions such as anxiety; and (3) overt as well
as covert physiological responses (Bloodstein, 1995; Van Riper & Emerick,
1984). Although numerous researchers have considered its emotional
implications, such as stress and time pressure (Blood, Wertz, Blood,
Bennett, & Simpson, 1997; Brutten, 1975; Brutten & Vanryckeghem,
1997; Cooper, 1993; Craig, 1990; Gregory, 1991; Schneier, Wexler, &
Liebowitz, 1997; Sheehan, 1970; Stunden, 1965), relatively few studies
have dealt with the cognitive aspects of stuttering. Those that exist focus on three domains: perception, attention, and time estimation. With
respect to perception, it has been reported that adults who stutter experience reduced visual and auditory perception during moments of stuttering (Froeschels & Rieber, 1963). Attention studies have shown that
when a stutterer performs a dual task, such as reading aloud, requiring
both verbal production and reading comprehension, the nonspeaking
part of the task--that is, comprehension--is disturbed. Unlike the fluent speaker, the stutterer pays more attention to speech than to content
(Kamhi & McOsker, 1982). Schmidt (1995) suggests that a person who
stutters passes into a state of internal thinking during the moment of
stuttering, and these thoughts absorb much of his/her attention.

The present study addressed the subject of time estimation, a cognitive factor that may be associated with
stuttering in several ways. Van Riper and Milisen (1939)
show that adults who stutter can anticipate and predict
the duration of their overt spasms. However, clinical
reports (Sheehan, 1970), as well as research data (Ringel
& Minifie, 1966), suggest that the period of disfluency,
which may last from a split second to several minutes,
is overestimated by the stutterer.
People constantly estimate how long whatever they
are doing takes, especially important activities. People
who stutter have the feeling they "are squandering (communication) time," as stuttering takes time. Although
their subjective feelings may exaggerate what actually
happens, there is a real waste of time in a state of communication for these people, and therefore study of this
phenomenon is clearly warranted.
Studies of the relation between time estimation and
time pressure in everyday experiences indicate that time
estimation cannot be separated from the anticipation of
an event or the progress of a task. Anticipation directs
attention to elements with the passing of time, thus increasing the subjective duration--a phenomenon epitomized by the maxim "a watched pot never boils" (Block,
George, & Reed, 1980; Cahoon & Edmonds, 1980; Fraisse,
1984, p. 23; Zakay, 1990, 1993a).
Zakay (1992a) suggests two concepts to explain the
dynamics by which mental states and cognitive strategies are processed in the sensation of time. The first,
Temporal Relevance, expresses the level of importance
assigned to the time dimension in a specific situation.
The second, Temporal Uncertainty, pertains to the level
of prior reliable knowledge that a person has concerning the duration of a specific time interval. Both concepts are in flux and may change constantly. In a series
of experiments, Zakay (1992a) reported that as the level
of these two factors increases, time estimates become
longer. Consequently, attention to time is viewed as the
system's willingness to absorb temporal cues.
The concepts of time relevance and time uncertainty
may be applied to the specific population of the present
study. It is well recognized that adults who stutter are
characterized by feelings of "being stuck," frustration,
anticipated stress, anxiety in speaking, and time pressure (Bloodstein, 1995; Gregory, 1991; Johnson, 1959;
Schmidt, 1995; Sheehan, 1970; Starkweather, 1995; Van
Riper, 1982; Wischner, 1952). All of these feelings can divert the individual's attention to temporal cues, thereby
resulting in an overestimation of time (Fraisse, 1963;
Harton, 1939; Hawkins & Tedford, 1976; Loehlin, 1959;
Meade, 1966; Michon, 1966; Orme, 1962).
The experience of psychological time pressure during communication is thought to be a major source of
stress for the adult stutterer. Sheehan (1958) posits that

acting under time pressure is a basic force influencing
the dynamics of stuttering. He suggests that a person
who stutters has a tendency to internalize the audience
time pressure and learns to act in anticipation of it.
Stress and time pressure are interrelated trait and
state factors that influence cognitive-affective processes
(Benzur & Breznitz, 1981; Janis, 1982; Wessman, 1973;
Zakay, 1990, 1993c). Time pressure increases feelings of
stress and causes hypervigilance, which, in turn, results
in an increased focus on the passing of time. Acting under this condition creates a state of divided attention
and competition between whatever task the individual
is performing on the one hand and time pressure on the
other. Mechanisms adopted for coping with time pressure include inhibition, acceleration, or shifting attention (Benzur & Breznitz, 1981; Janis, 1982; Lundberg,
1993; Schulz & Schonpflug, 1982; Zakay, 1993c). Thus
when time pressure is a factor in verbal communication, stutterers may be driven to speed up their speaking rate, avoid speaking altogether, or monitor their
manner of speaking, thereby activating and aggravating the stuttering (Bloodstein, 1995; Meyers & Freeman,
1985a, 1985b; Rustin, Cook, & Spence, 1995; Schneider,
1998; Starkweather, 1987; Vekassy, 1993).
In view of the mutual relationship between time
pressure and time estimation, we chose to focus on time
estimation in an attempt to obtain a better understanding of the stutterer's cognitive processes in oral and nonoral situations. The investigation of time estimation as
experienced by adults who stutter appears warranted
from both theoretical and clinical perspectives. Research
indicates that time estimation is sensitive to the presence of perceptual/cognitive demands, whereas tasks
that are done automatically do not interfere with it.
Thus, when performed simultaneously with another
task, time estimation may be used as a sensitive and
practical index of mental workload (Liu & Wickens, 1994;
Zakay, 1998; Zakay, Block, & Tsal, 1999). Speaking is a
multiple-dimension task that may not have gained automaticity in someone who stutterers. That is, in the
process of speaking, stutterers basically undergo the
same procedure as fluent speakers, yet additionally, and
simultaneously, also pay attention to the flow, rate, and
duration of their speech (Gregory, 1991; Sheehan, 1970).
Consequently, if a stutterer is asked to estimate the
duration of his or her conversation, the response can be
viewed as an index of the mental resources allocated to
it. This has implications both for the general body of
knowledge about stuttering and for the specific stutterer
in the clinic.
In spite of the clinical importance of the time factor
in stuttering, it has thus far been the focus of only two
studies. Time estimation through the discrimination of
sound intervals was tested by Herndon (1966), who found

that adult stutterers were poorer at discriminating time
intervals than normally fluent speakers. The only study
that focused on the ability of adults who stutter to estimate time in diversified speech and natural situations
was conducted by Ringel and Minifie (1966), motivated
by Van Riper and Milisen's (1939) observations. They
hypothesized that stuttering adults would overestimate
the duration of various situations. Their participants
consisted of three groups: adults who stuttered mildly,
adults who stuttered moderately to severely, and fluent
speakers--all of whom were asked to estimate 10 seconds in different situations, using the production method.
The results showed that although all participants tended
to overestimate time duration, the adults who stuttered
moderately to severely exhibited the highest estimates.
For the two groups of stutterers, there was a significant
difference between communicative situations and silent
ones, with overestimation of time occurring in communicative situations only.
These two studies suffered from several flaws. First,
they employed paradigms that restricted the results and
limited the ability to explain the phenomenon of greater
overestimation. In addition, they did not explain their
results by means of a cognitive model.
The objective of the present investigation was to
revisit time judgment using a more elaborate methodology and relying on a cognitive model to explain the
processes involved. A prospective paradigm was designed
to compare adults who stutter with normally fluent
speakers, as well as to compare stutterers exhibiting
differing levels of severity. Moreover, two methods of time
estimation and different tasks were used.
The method of estimating time is one of the factors
that influence the estimation itself (Hicks, Miller, &
Kinsbourne, 1976; Zakay, 1990, 1993a; Zakay & Block,
1997), as different methods entail somewhat different
cognitive processes (Zakay, 1993a). The present study
employed the production and reproduction methods of
time estimation. In production, a duration is stated verbally and the participant is asked to delimit an actual
time period judged to be the length of the specified duration. (This method was used by Ringel and Minifie,
1966.) In reproduction, the participants are asked to
delimit a time period corresponding to their previous
experience of the target duration. Although production
usually increases the greater the processing demands
during a given time period, the reverse generally holds
for time reproduction. With the production method, time
estimations are typically longer than the time given to
the participants--a phenomenon known as overestimation (Fortin & Rousseau, 1987; Hicks, Gualtieri, Mayo,
& Perez-Reyes, 1984; Zakay 1993b). In contrast, with
the reproduction method time estimations tend to be
significantly shorter than the actual duration of the

146

task--a phenomenon known as underestimation (Brown,
1985; Gardner, Reyes, Brake, & Salaz, 1984; Zakay,
1993b).
Four verbal tasks were chosen for the study, two nonoral (silent reading and listening to reading) and two oral
(reading aloud and conversation), in order to determine
whether time estimation would differ. We assumed that
for all participants oral tasks, which are more complex
(cognitively loaded), would require more attention and
thereby influence time estimation more than non-oral
tasks. Moreover, adults who stutter were expected to
feel more stress and time pressure on oral tasks than
on non-oral tasks, making their estimation of time less
accurate. Consequently, we hypothesized that (a) adults
who stutter would provide less accurate time estimation than fluent speakers; (b) time estimation would be
less accurate for oral tasks than for non-oral tasks; (c)
there would be an interaction in time estimation by population (adults who stutter and fluent speakers) and task
(non-oral and oral), and that the gap in time estimation
between non-oral and oral tasks would be greater for
stutterers; and (d) as severity of stuttering increased,
time estimation would be less accurate.

Method
Participants
Participants consisted of 94 males, 47 who stutter and
47 normally fluent speakers, between the ages of 18 and
43 years. Only males were selected because the pool of
adult women stutterers was too limited. The participants
who stutter were recruited from clinics that treat stuttering. Because of the location of the clinics, a high percentage of the participants were soldiers. The criteria
for determining stuttering were (a) self-definition, (b)
report of a speech-language clinician, and (c) quantity
and quality analysis of 600 speech samples recorded
syllabically in each of two situations: reading and conversational speaking. The minimum of "less typical"
disfluencies (Campbell & Hill, 1991, p. 49) was 3%. Individuals who met at least two of the three criteria were
included in the sample; 45 participants met all three
criteria, and two participants met two criteria. In addition, all participants received a rating of between mild
to severe on the Stuttering Severity Instrument (Riley,
1972).
Participants in the control group were regarded by
themselves and by the experimenter (a speech-language
clinician) as being fluent. To be included, their conversational and reading speech samples had to contain
fewer than 3% typical disfluencies. Each fluent speaker
was matched as well as possible to a stutterer according
to age, occupational group, education, matriculation,

birthplace, and socioeconomic status (measured by the
number of rooms in the subject's dwelling and the number of occupants). Table 1 shows the frequencies of the
nominal variables and Table 2 the means and standard
deviations of the continuous variables of the two groups.
Comparisons for the two groups on these variables were
conducted by 2 for the nominal variables and t test for
the continuous variables. Tables 1 and 2 show that the
two groups did not differ significantly in background
characteristics.
Additional criteria for the selection of participants
were the absence of (a) major neurological problems, (b)
language problems, and (c) psychiatric problems (as ascertained through a questionnaire completed by the
participant).

Stuttering Severity
The Systematic Disfluency Analysis (Campbell & Hill,
1991) was used to determine frequency of disfluency in
600 syllables (a detailed description of the method used
appears in the procedure section below) and constituted
one of the criteria for selecting participants. The category
of "less typical disfluency" (p. 39) included word repetition exceeding three iterations, syllable repetition, sound
repetition, prolongation, block, and tense interjection.
Stuttering severity was assessed by means of the
Stuttering Severity Instrument (SSI; Riley, 1972), which
provides a total scale score based on the frequency and
duration of instances of stuttering, in addition to ratings of physical concomitants (as derived from videotapes). Possible SSI scores range from 0 to 45; in the
current sample of adults who stutter, the SSI scores
ranged from 7 to 39. We divided stuttering severity into
two categories according to the median test score of the
SSI--namely, 23.5.
Interjudge reliability was based on the independent
scoring of 20 participants by two experienced clinicians,
one of whom is the first author. The coefficient for the
total number of disfluencies was r = .99, point-by-point
(location and type) comparisons yielded an overall reliability value of r = .85, and interjudge reliability of the
SSI scores for the total test score was r = .96. The reliability value for the various components varied from r =
.75 (extremity movement) to r = .99 (frequency).

they had performed immediately after being stopped by
the experimenter. As stated above the production method
generally leads to overestimation, whereas the reproduction method tends to result in underestimation (Zakay,
1990, 1993b).
The duration of the time interval that participants
were asked to estimate was 30 seconds. Four different
tasks were used: (1) silent reading of a short story; (2)
listening to a recorded short story; (3) reading aloud a
short story; and (4) conversation with the experimenter
on the subjects of family, leisure time activities, and
hobbies. All stories were Aesop and La Fontaine fables
(Fratelli, 1977). Tasks were performed in a counterbalanced order. Half of the participants began with the production method, whereas the other half started with the
reproduction method. The order of tasks was randomly
assigned to participants and was held constant for the
individual across the two methods.
A prospective paradigm was used--that is, the participants were informed before performing the tasks that

they would have to estimate the duration of performance.
They were asked to remove their watches and then received the following instructions: "Soon you will perform
different tasks. You will perform each task twice but
using different methods." In the production method, the
participants received the instruction: "I will play a 30second sound so that you get an idea of how long 30
seconds is. Then you will perform a task. At the beginning of the task you will press a button that will activate the timer. Press the button again to stop the timer
when you feel that 30 seconds have elapsed." In the reproduction method, the participants were instructed:
"You will perform the task, and at some point you will
hear a whistle. This means that you have to stop immediately and then estimate the time that has elapsed from
the beginning of the task to the moment of the whistle.
Press the button to activate the timer and press it again
to stop it."

Procedure
Before performing the tasks, the stutterers were
informed that the purpose of the study was to advance
understanding of stuttering by testing the influence of
various parameters on time estimation. The control
group was told that the purpose was to examine the
various parameters that may influence time estimation.
All participants were told that they were going to perform tasks using one method and then perform similar
tasks using another method. In all cases, time estimation would start the moment they heard the word begin.
They were also told that they would receive a description of the task and that they could ask questions. After
this they would hear the words Ready, begin.
All participants were videotaped using a Sony CCDF450E camcorder. In addition, their speech was recorded
by a voice-operated Sony TCM-5000EVcassette recorder.
This material was used to analyze stuttering and to
measure its severity. After all tasks were completed,
participants were asked questions and read a neutral
passage taken from a book of humorous short stories in
order to acquire 600 syllables for analysis of stuttering
assessment and severity. Finally, participants filled in
a personal information questionnaire that included background characteristics, which was used to match the two
groups of participants.

measure of time estimation in the current study was
the degree of accuracy (i.e., deviation from clock time),
poorer accuracy thus means higher overestimation in
the production method and greater underestimation in
the reproduction method. The level of significance (Alpha) for testing the hypotheses was .05.
Means and standard deviations of time estimation
by method, population, and task (oral/non-oral) are presented in Table 3. A three-way ANOVA with repeated
measures on two factors was performed with population (stutterers/fluent speakers) as one factor and
method (production/reproduction) and task category
(oral/non-oral) as the repeated factors and with time
estimation as the dependent variable. A significant effect of method was found [F(1, 92) = 39.08, p < .001],
resulting from less accurate time estimation in production as compared with reproduction--the means being
13.71 s and 4.47 s, respectively. No significant effect of
population was found [F(1, 92) = .074, p > .05], providing no support for the hypothesis that adults who stutter estimate time less accurately. However, in line with
expectations, the effect of task on time estimation was
significant [F(1, 92) = 156.07, p < .001], resulting from a
less accurate estimation of the oral than of the non-oral
tasks, with means of 13.91 s and 4.27 s, respectively. In
addition, we found an interaction between task category
and method [F(1, 92) = 75.73, p < .001]. In both methods, the time estimation was less accurate on the oral
tasks, but the gap between the oral and the non-oral
tasks was greater in production (D = 15.62) than in reproduction (D = 3.66).
As predicted, the interaction between task category
and population was significant [F(1, 92) = 4.13, p < .05].
As can be seen in Table 3 and Figure 1, the difference
between the two task categories is greater for stutterers
(D = 11.22) than for fluent speakers (D = 8.08). In addition, the difference in time estimation between stutterers
and fluent speakers was greater on oral tasks (D = 2.84)
than on non-oral tasks (D = -0.28). There were no significant interactions (a) between method and population

and (b) among method, task category, and population.
Each task category included two subtasks: (a) reading aloud and conversation for the oral and (b) silent
reading and listening for the non-oral. In order to further investigate the effect of task on time estimation,
we compared the two pairs of specific tasks: (a) silent
reading versus reading aloud and (b) listening versus
conversation. The former tested the effect of voice, articulation, and fluency, whereas the latter added a test
of communicative interaction. Two three-way ANOVAs
with repeated measures on two factors were performed,
with population (stutterers/fluent speakers) as one factor and method (production/reproduction) and task category as the repeated factors and with time estimation
as the dependent variable.
The first ANOVA was conducted on the reading tasks
(silent reading/reading aloud) and the second on the communicative tasks (listening/conversation). The means and
standard deviations of the time estimations are presented in Table 4.

The ANOVA of the reading tasks revealed a significant main effect of task [F(1, 92) = 92.09, p < .001], indicating a less accurate time estimation for reading aloud
(M = 11.32) than for silent reading (M = 3.15). A significant interaction did not emerge between task and population [F(1, 92) = 1.06, p > .05]. Moreover, here too a
significant interaction was found between task category
and method [F(1, 92) = 21.21, p < .001]. In both methods
the time estimation was less accurate on the oral task,
but the gap between the oral and the non-oral tasks was
greater in production (D = 11.71) than in reproduction
(D = 4.73). The results revealed no significant effect of
population [F(1, 92) = .03, p > .05]. However, we found a
significant main effect of method [F(1, 92) = 17.24, p <
.001], indicating a less accurate time estimation for production (M = 10.78) than for reproduction (M = 3.69).
There was no significant interaction among task category, method, and population [F(1, 92) = .58, p > .05].
The ANOVA of the communicative tasks revealed a
significant effect for task [F(1, 92) = 91.84, p < .001],
indicating a less accurate time estimation on the conversation (M = 16.50) than on the listening (M = 5.39)
task. A significant interaction also emerged between task
and population [F(1, 92) = 3.79, p < .05]. As can be seen
in Table 4, the difference between the two task categories is greater among adults who stutter (D = 13.37) than
among fluent speakers (D = 8.85). In addition, the difference in time estimation between stutterers and fluent speakers was greater on the conversation task (D =
4.54) than on the listening task (D = 0.02). Furthermore,
a significant interaction was found between task category and method [F(1, 92) = 58.13, p < .001]. Similar to
the findings for the reading tasks, in both methods the
time estimation was less accurate on the conversation
task, but the gap between the conversation and the listening tasks was greater in production (D = 19.53) than
in reproduction (D = 2.70). This analysis also produced
no significant effect of population [F(1, 92) = 2.26, p >
.05], in contrast to a significant main effect of method
[F(1, 92) = 59.69, p < .001], indicating a less accurate
time estimation for production (M = 16.64) than for

reproduction (M = 5.26). Again, there was no significant
interaction among task category, population, and method
[F(1, 92) = 2.47, p > .05].
In order to test the hypothesis pertaining to stuttering severity, we used the median of 23.5 as measured
by SSI (Riley, 1972) to classify the stutterers as mild or
severe. A three-way ANOVA with repeated measures on
two factors was performed with stuttering severity (mild
stutterers/severe stutterers) as one factor and method
(production/reproduction) and task category (oral/nonoral) as the repeated factors, and with time estimation
as the dependent variable. A significant main effect of
stuttering severity was found [F(1, 45) = 5.92, p < .05],
resulting from less accurate time estimation among severe stutterers than among mild stutterers, the means
being 24.81 and 14.75, respectively. A significant main
effect of task category was found [F(1, 45) = 93.57, p <
.001], with less accurate time estimation on the oral than
the non-oral tasks, the means being 15.34 and 4.13, respectively. A significant main effect of method was also
found [F(1, 45) = 11.55, p < .001], resulting from less
accurate time estimation in production than reproduction, with means of 13.33 and 6.13, respectively. The
interaction between stuttering severity and task category was not significant [F(1, 45) = 1.10, p > .05], although a significant interaction did emerge between
severity and method [F(1, 45) = 4.60, p < .05]. In both
groups time estimation was less accurate in the production method, but the gap in time estimation between
the two methods was greater for severe stutterers (D =
24.81) than for mild stutterers (D = 14.75).
For all stutterers, a significant interaction was found
between method and task category [F(1, 45) = 52.10, p <
.001]. In both methods, time estimation was less accurate on the oral tasks, but the gap in time estimation
between the two task categories was greater in production (D = 18.36) than in reproduction (D = 4.08). This
interaction also revealed the difference between the two
methods to be significant at p < .01 only on the oral tasks.
The three-way interaction yielded a significant effect [F(1, 45) = 5.06, p < .05] (see Figure 2). As can be
seen, the time estimation of the oral tasks was less accurate than that of the non-oral tasks in both methods
for both severity groups. In order to explain the interaction, paired t tests were conducted between time estimation of oral and non-oral tasks in each method for
severe and mild stutterers separately, with Bonferonni
correction for multiple comparison. The results of the
t tests revealed that for the mild stutterers the gap between the two task categories was significant at p < .01
both in production [t(24) = 5.48] and in reproduction
[t(24) = 5.15]. For the severe stutterers, the gap between
the two task categories was significant at p < .01 in the
production method only [t(21) = 7.56].

task category.

To summarize, the time estimation of adults who
stutter did not differ significantly from that of fluent
speakers. Severe stutterers, however, estimated time
less accurately than mild stutterers, and the time estimation of oral tasks was less accurate for all stutterers
than for fluent speakers. In addition, task category was
found to be different for the two populations; the gap in
time estimation between adults who stutter and fluent
speakers was greater on oral than on non-oral tasks. A
closer examination of the subtasks revealed that the
interaction between population and task category resulted from the communicative tasks and not from the
reading tasks.
Furthermore, the influence of task category on the
time estimation of severe versus mild stutterers was
found to be method-dependent. The greatest inaccuracy
was demonstrated by severe stutterers when estimating the time of an oral task by the production method.

Discussion
The results of the present study reveal that although time estimation is related to stuttering, the
nature of this relationship is complex and is affected
by type of task and method of measurement. The notion that a person who stutters will overestimate time
more than a fluent speaker was previously tested in
only one study (Ringel & Minifie, 1966). The present
study, conducted about 30 years later, provides support
for the first study while adding several important insights. Ringel and Minifie employed only one method of
time estimation: the production method. In the present
study, both production and reproduction were used to
estimate oral and non-oral tasks. The results produce
the same pattern as those of Ringel and Minifie (1966).

Thus, adults who stutter severely estimated time less
accurately than those who stutter mildly, but no difference was found between the stutterers as a whole and
the fluent speakers. Contrary to the findings of Ringel
and Minifie, a difference was observed in the present
study between tasks (oral and non-oral) and between
subtasks (silent reading and reading aloud, and listening and conversation). We also found an interaction between population and task category and among stuttering severity, task category, and method of measurement.
In adults who stutter, as well as in fluent speakers,
time estimation was less accurate on oral tasks than on
non-oral tasks. This may be explained by the increase
in information load processing involved in performing
an oral task, thus reducing the attention paid to temporal processing and resulting in a less accurate time estimation (Zakay, 1989, 1993a; Zakay, Block, & Tsal, 1999).
These results support cognitive models based on capacity and context-dependent processing, such as Zakay's
(1989, 1993a) Dual Contingency Model of Short Duration Judgment. According to this model, a negative correlation exists between nontemporal information load
processing and the subjective time estimation or degree
of accuracy. Viewing time estimation as a function of
information load processing may help to explain why in
the current study time estimation on the oral tasks was
found to be less accurate than on the non-oral tasks in
both populations and both methods.
Our results also indicate that the difference between
time estimation on the two tasks was population dependent. Although there was no difference between the two
populations on the non-oral tasks, adults who stutter
estimated time less accurately on the oral tasks. Thus,
the gap between the tasks was greater for stutterers
than for fluent speakers. A closer look at the characteristics of the tasks revealed that the interaction between
population and task resulted from conversation versus
listening and not from reading aloud versus silent reading. This may be explained in terms of the nature of the
two types of tasks that had to be performed simultaneously with time estimation. It may be assumed that
most people have developed a behavioral automaticity
for reading aloud (more so than for conversation). Consequently, the mental workload involved is less demanding, leading to more accurate time estimation (Liu &
Wickens, 1994). Conversation can be viewed as a task
for which the fluent speaker may have developed some
degree of automaticity. For the person who stutters, however, not only are the cognitive/linguistic demands and
anticipation of stress high, but the verbal communication
is unpredictable in terms of fluency (Bloodstein, 1995;
Boland, 1953; Conture, 1990; Craig, 1990; Fitzgerald,
Djurdjic, & Maguin, 1992; Greiner, Fitzgerald, Cooke,
& Djurdjic, 1985; Peters & Hulstijn, 1984). Therefore,
conversation is not an automatic task for stutterers,

which explains why their time estimation was less accurate here. As noted by Schneider and Shiffrin (1977),
interference between two simultaneous tasks will be
greatly increased if either of the tasks has not developed automaticity.
A further finding showed that adults who stutter
mildly estimated time more accurately than those who
stutter severely. Two explanations are suggested for the
influence of stuttering severity on time estimation. First,
in the present study we defined stuttering severity by
scores on the SSI test (Riley, 1972). Riley's view of severity includes more moments of stuttering, a longer
duration of each moment, and a higher level of tension.
This results in more "dead" moments, because there is
a decline in perception during stuttering moments
(Froeschels & Rieber, 1963). Secondly, as Perkins (1983)
describes stuttering as the feeling of losing control over
speech (a feeling of helplessness), we may assume that
as severity increases, the stutterer will experience higher
trait and state anxiety in the form of time pressure
(Brutten, 1975; Caruso, Chodzko-Zajko, Bidinger, &
Sommers, 1994; Fitzgerald, Djurdjic, & Maguin, 1992;
Schneider, 1998; Van Riper, 1982; Weber & Smith, 1990;
Webster, 1996). Stress is an additional load on working
memory and influences shared attention (Breznits &
Goldberger, 1982; Eysenck, 1982). Moreover, it has been
shown that anxiety stress interferes with time estimation as a cognitive process (Felix, 1965; Fraisse, 1984;
Hawkes, Joy, & Evan, 1962; Orme, 1962; Ornstein, 1969;
Osato, Ogawa, & Takaoka, 1995).
It thus seems clear that our categorization of severity (Riley, 1972) is useful for the understanding of time
estimation. Stuttering severity has historically been
described according to behavioral criteria, such as frequency and duration of stuttering episodes, and occurrence of secondary symptoms, such as signs of abnormal effort. Furthermore, there are physiological as well
as psychological correlates to behaviorally determined
degrees of severity (Borden, 1990).
Time estimation was also affected by the method of
measurement--that is, it was less accurate in production than in reproduction in both populations. In order
to explain these results we must consider the different
cognitive processes involved in time estimation in the
two methods. In the production method (i.e., participants
are required to perform a task, terminating it when they
feel that the specified time interval has elapsed), time
estimation is based on the predetermined number of
subjective time units that the individual has in his/her
mind after being told the required duration of the task
interval. This results in the objective time duration that
the individual signals, which is the subjective number
of time units multiplied by clock time. On the other hand,
the reproduction method (i.e., participants are asked to

estimate the duration of a task immediately after being
stopped by the experimenter) can be said to consist of
two phases. In the first, the accumulation phase, the
individual registers time experiences in memory; in the
second, the production phase, he or she estimates the
duration of the first phase by retrieving time information from memory. The subject's complete attention is
directed to the time estimation task (Zakay, 1993a, 1998;
Zakay, Block, & Tsal, 1999). In the production phase of
the reproduction method, time estimation occurs in all
four tasks without speech--that is, estimation in the
reproduction method is less sensitive to the uniqueness
of the tasks (Carlson & Feinberg, 1970; Fortin & Breton,
1995). This differential characteristic of the two methods explains the less accurate time estimation in production than in reproduction.
Furthermore, the influence of stuttering severity on
time estimation was more pronounced in production
than in reproduction. We would interpret these results
on the basis of the interface between the method of time
estimation and our unique population, specifically the
severity of stuttering. Fortin, Rousseau, Bourque, and
Kirouac (1993) claim that in the production method, time
estimation is accumulated from the beginning of the
task; any interference from the nontemporal task will
stop the subjective clock and, in doing so, will extend
the duration of clock time. When a person is asked to stop
a communicative task after 30 s, time units seem longer
because of the state of time pressure (Zakay, 1993c). Time
pressure is the most salient characteristic of adults who
stutter (Gregory, 1991; Schneider, 1995; Sheehan, 1970);
and, indeed, clinical observation reveals that as time
pressure increases, stuttering becomes more severe.
Thus, when stuttering severity increases, a higher number of subjective time units are predetermined. In the
moments of stuttering, which are more frequent in severe stutterers (Bloodstein, 1995; Riley, 1972), the accumulation of time units in the cognitive timer is stopped
or erased, while clock time continues until the stutterer
estimates that 30 s have elapsed. The production method
uses parameters that are more sensitive to the situational characteristics of the estimator (Block, 1989;
Carlson & Feinberg, 1970; McConchie & Rutschmann,
1971). Moreover, in the production method, the stuttering occurs in the direct process of time estimation.
This study lends support to the notion that stuttering severity plays a role in the cognitive processes of
adults who stutter (Hamre, 1985). The question remains
as to whether the cognitive process that is expressed in
time estimation is among the factors that determine
the severity of stuttering or whether it is the result of
performing a task while stuttering--and as such is a
cause that perpetuates it.
Only in the oral tasks, specifically the conversation

152

task (which entailed not only voice, as in reading, but also
language comprehension, language production, and interaction), did severe stutterers estimate time less accurately than mild stutterers. Our findings thus reveal
that the least accurate time estimation was yielded by
severe stutterers in the production method on the oral
tasks. This is consistent with Zakay's (1989, 1994) contention that we cannot project from one method to the
other. Production, more than reproduction, is hypersensitive to the internal and external influences of the characteristics of the estimator and the task (Block, 1989; Carlson
& Feinberg, 1970; McConchie & Rutschmann, 1971).
The results of this study highlight the importance
of time estimation in dual-task conditions (Zakay, 1998).
Because the stutterer estimates time in every oral task
in daily life, the worry about "overtaking other people's
time" is commonly observed in clinical interaction
(Sheehan, 1958, p. 144). Adult stutterers therefore divide their attention between the actual task and the timing of it (Zakay, Block, & Tsal, 1999). As a result of this
simultaneity--that is, the complexity of both performing an oral task and estimating its duration under conditions of time relevance and time uncertainty--the reflexive reaction of adults who stutter is to speak quickly
and/or to avoid speaking altogether. Time pressure, time
estimation, and overt stuttering behavior can all be
viewed as mutually interactive components of the syndrome of stuttering (Gregory, 1991; Schneider, 1995;
Sheehan, 1970).
The importance of time as an element of communication can be used as a clinical tool and a target in
therapy. Time estimation as a measure of mental workload appears to be sensitive to the presence of perceptual/cognitive demands. Tasks that are done automatically do not interfere with time estimation. Thus, we
suggest using time estimation as an evaluation index to
measure the subjective difficulty of the situation. Focusing on time in the therapeutic process may help to
reduce or diminish the reflexive reactions that increase
the severity of stuttering.
Time estimation can be practiced in therapy in order to improve the evaluation of time duration. This
can be done by either of two approaches: explaining the
model of time estimation (Zakay, 1989, 1992b, 1998) or
providing repeated feedback on duration evaluation.
Because we found that time estimation was least accurate during conversation, a person who stutters may
be helped to make the conversation more automatic by
learning to reduce the attention he or she pays to the
time dimension while speaking. This can be done
through practice of a technique to generate fluency
(Boberg & Kully, 1985; Ingham & Onslow, 1985; Onslow
& Packman, 1997; Ryan, 1974; Webster, 1980) or by
diverting the focus from the fluency of speech to the

process of communication itself (Sheehan, 1970). It is
also advisable in therapy to address the feeling of time
pressure (Gregory, 1991; Schneider, 1995). As Perkins
(1975) points out, pausing while speaking can help the
stutterer to resist feelings of time pressure. Time pressure habituation may also be achieved through repeated
experience with time pressure situations.
As mentioned earlier, the issue of time estimation
appears to be an important element in the dynamics of
stuttering. Nevertheless, current information is sparse.
Much more experimental research is needed for a thorough understanding of this important aspect of adults
who stutter and its implications for the treatment of
the disorder.
This study examined the time estimation of 30-s
durations of adult stutterers. We must therefore be careful in generalizing the results before further information is available. The question remains as to whether
less accurate time estimation is a general phenomenon
and if it can be observed in noncommunicative tasks,
such as eating, running, or some passive activity, as well.
Future research might be conducted using other durations, such as the length of a stuttering block. Investigating other populations in which time pressure but not
speech problems are characteristic or in populations with
different fluency problems that are not classified as subject to time pressure might answer the question of
whether inaccurate time estimation is dependent on time
pressure or is part of speech difficulty. It might also be
interesting to study the time-estimation behavior of children--as opposed to adults--who display no reactive
behavior, such as feelings of time pressure. This might
reveal whether inaccuracy in time estimation appears
at the onset of stuttering or whether it is the result of
the development of covert reactions to stuttering.
