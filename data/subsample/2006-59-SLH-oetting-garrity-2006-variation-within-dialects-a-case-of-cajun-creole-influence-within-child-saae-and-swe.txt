Purpose: This study examined whether child speakers of Southern African American
English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE) who were also perceived by some
listeners to present a Cajun/Creole English (CE) influence within their dialects produced
elevated rates of 6 phonological and 5 morphological patterns of vernacular relative
to other SAAE- and SWE-speaking children.
Method: A group comparison design was followed. The data were listener judgments,
1-min audiotaped excerpts of conversational speech, and transcribed language
samples from 93 children (31 classified as specifically language impaired while
the others were classified as either aged-matched or language-matched controls;
13 classified as SWE with CE, 40 classified as SWE only, 18 classified as SAAE
with CE, and 22 classified as SAAE only).
Results: Results indicated that children with a CE influence produced elevated rates of
vernacular phonology relative to the others, with 2 patterns (nonaspirated stops and
glide reduction) showing statistically significant group differences. In contrast, the
children's use of vernacular morphology was unrelated to their CE status, but was
instead related to their primary dialect (SWE vs. SAAE) and language ability
classification (impaired vs. normal).
Conclusions: The findings highlight the role of phonology in listeners' perceptions of
dialect variation within 2 nonmainstream dialects (SWE and SAAE). The findings also
demonstrate the ways phonological and morphological forms of vernacular can be
independently influenced by different types of child variables.

anguage use varies across individuals even when these individuals
are perceived to speak the same general dialect. In some cases, this
variation relates to individual differences between speakers (for
more discussion of idiolects, see Mufwene, 2001). In other cases, the variation can be tied to one or more variables that systematically influence
the language of a subgroup. One example of this latter type of influence
can be found in Myhill's (1988) study of AAE /r/-deletion. Within this
study, rates of /r/-deletion were found to vary as a function of two variables, speaker age and speaker contact with non-AAE speakers. Speakers under 25 years of age who had less contact with non-AAE speakers
were more likely to delete /r/ than those who were older and had more
contact. In addition, there were group differences in the linguistic conditioning of the deletion. For the former, /a/ disfavored deletion whereas
for the latter, /a/ had the same effect on deletion as other vowels.
The current study reflects a first attempt to study some of the language variation that is present in the nonmainstream English dialects of

children who live in Louisiana. Although Louisiana is
well known for its linguistic diversity and Cajun/Creole
French heritage, very few empirical studies have been
completed on the dialects of this state. Moreover, missing
from the literature is a well-developed framework and
set of methods for studying speaker variation as a variable
within a single dialect and / or multidialect investigation. An existing dataset of 93 child language samples provided us an opportunity to examine both of these
issues. The samples were collected from children who
lived in a rural area in southeastern Louisiana (for previous studies of these samples, see Oetting, Cantrell, &
Horohov, 1999; Oetting & McDonald, 2001, 2002; Ross,
Oetting, & Stapleton, 2004; Wynn, Eyles, & Oetting, 2000).
Although our past research has shown that the dialects within these samples reflect varieties of Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern
White English (SWE), results from an earlier listener
judgment study by Oetting and McDonald (2002) also
indicated that some of the children sounded a little Cajun
and/or Creole to some listeners. In the current study, we
further examined these data to learn more about the
linguistic factors that may have contributed to these
results. By doing this, we also aimed to establish a set
of methods that can be used by other researchers who
are interested in studying childhood language acquisition
and/or impairment within the context of dialect diversity.
As background, we review relevant findings from the 2002
listener judgment study and previous findings from adult
studies of Cajun/Creole English (CE).

2002 Listener Judgment Study
The listener judgment task asked three doctoral students in linguistics to independently classify the dialects of 93 children by listening to a 1-min excerpt from
each child's language sample. Although the earlier publication of this work focused on the children's use of SAAE
or SWE, other information about the excerpts was also
collected. For example, the raters were asked to indicate the language features they used to make their dialect
judgments, and when possible, to write down dialectspecific patterns of vernacular. To facilitate the raters'
identification of relevant language features, the rating
form asked them to check one or more of the following:
paralinguistic behaviors including stress and intonation,
phonology, morphology and syntax, and vocabulary. For
dialect-specific patterns, the rating form provided them a
blank area for writing.
The listeners' answers to these questions indicated
that all of the children were speaking a Louisiana variety
of SAAE or SWE; however, for 31 of the 93 cases, one or
more of the listeners also indicated that they perceived a
Cajun/Creole influence within the children's use of SAAE

or SWE. Specific comments on the dialect rating forms
were as follows: sounds a little bit Cajun/Creole, some
Cajun/Creole flavoring in his/her speech, and some
Cajun/Creole features heard. The listeners also indicated that their dialect judgments were based mostly on
phonology (86%), and this was followed by morphology
and syntax (61%), paralinguistics (41%), and vocabulary
(24%). Finally, for the children who were perceived
to sound a little bit Cajun/Creole, the raters wrote down
monophthongization as the most frequent vernacular
pattern that they heard. Other patterns that were listed
less frequently were vowel lowering, glide weakening on
vowels, vowel nasalization, /t, d/ for /q, 8 / substitutions,
/r/ weakening, and word final consonant deletions. As demonstrated next, these particular comments by the listeners, while self-generated, are consistent with what is
known about CE in Louisiana.

Cajun/Creole English
Consider first the listeners' perceptions of the children's dialects as reflecting SAAE or SWE instead of
CE. As mentioned earlier, very few empirical studies
have been completed on the dialects of Louisiana, and
this includes varieties of CE. As a consequence, what is
typically known about CE comes from illustrations of the
dialect from newspapers, film, books, songs, travel signs,
and advertisements (for two examples, see Boudreaux,
2000; Trosclair, 1973; for an anthology of CE works, see
also Scott, 1992). As discussed by Dubois and Horvath,
these portrayals of CE are impressionistic and do not
provide information about the language of modern-day
Cajuns and Creoles. Nevertheless, a stereotypical speaker
of CE is an elderly man who is bilingual in French and
English and lives in the Acadian Triangle (for sociocultural history, see Brasseaux, 1987, 2004; Din, 1999;
Dominguez, 1986; Hall, 1995; Henry & Bankston, 2001,
2002). Figure 1 demarcates the Acadian Triangle and
lists the percentage of adult residents within and outside
of this area who claimed the ability to speak French on
the 1990 U.S. Census. As can be seen, the children who
provided the samples studied here lived in the Acadian
Triangle, but their community was on the far eastern
border in an area where few residents claim the ability
to speak French. The age and bilingual ability of the
stereotypical CE speaker, along with the demographic
information about the Acadian Triangle, helps explain
why the listeners could be unanimous in their perceptions of the children's dialects as not stereotypical of CE
while at the same time perceive a CE influence in some of
the children's SAAE and SWE dialects.
Next, consider the listeners' use of the term Cajun/
Creole. Current studies of self-described Cajuns generally result in participant pools that are White and of
Acadian descent, and studies of self-described Creoles

often result in participant pools that are of African and
French descent. Nevertheless, Cajun and Creole histories
also include contact and assimilation with each other as
well as contact and assimilation with other French immigrants; German, Irish, Italian, and Spanish immigrants;
African Americans; and Native Americans. Creole history
is even more complicated, with different groups claiming
Creole status at different periods and with the impact of
Reconstruction, Jim Crow Laws, and the civil rights movement on Creole self-identity (for review, see earlier Cajun/
Creole references and Dubois & Melacon, 1997, 2000). Our
listeners' use of the term Cajun/Creole to describe perceived ethnic influences within the SAAE and SWE dialects of the children demonstrates an understanding of
the terms Cajun and Creole as having highly complex,
imprecise, debated, and at times overlapping histories.
Finally, consider the listeners' reliance on phonology
to identify the CE influence within the child samples. To
date, only one quantitative study has been completed on
the English that is spoken by self-identified Creoles and
only six have been completed on the English of selfidentified Cajuns (Cheramie, 1998; Dubois & Horvath,
1998, 1999, 2003a, 2003b; Rubrecht, 1971; Walton, 1994).
Nevertheless, the emphasis of these adult CE studies
parallels that of our listeners' comments, because six of

18

the adult studies examined phonology, three examined
morphology, and only one attempted to quantify (in a
very limited way) some of the words, phrases, discourse
features, and/or intonation characteristics of CE.
A review of the adult studies also indicates that
although CE is often linked to a French or Cajun/Creole
French variety, the origin and evolution of this dialect
is far more complicated than a simple model of language
interference or language transfer. Studies by Dubois and
Horvath (1998, 1999) provide evidence for this claim.
Their language samples come from a large database of
participants who represent speakers from three age
groups (young [20-39 years], middle-aged [40-59], and old
[60+]), both males and females, speakers whose first
language is either French or English, and speakers from
both open and closed social networks. As illustrated in
Table 1, some CE patterns (e.g., nonaspirated stops) show
a linear decrease of use from old to young speakers, a
finding that is consistent with a model of language
interference of French for the old speakers, with diachronic
assimilation to English by the middle-aged and young
speakers.

voiced contexts and final contexts) show a V-shaped pattern of change, with old and young speakers producing
higher rates of use than the middle-aged speakers. Finally, for some patterns and some speakers (e.g., substitutions involving /d/ for /8 / for males from open social
networks), a linear increase from old to young occurs.
Dubois and Horvath interpret the V-shaped findings and
linear increases of use as reflecting a Cajun renaissance or Francophone resurgence in Louisiana and
argue that these higher rates of use by young speakers help set current varieties of CE apart from other
English dialects.
In addition, Dubois and Horvath's research has
repeatedly documented the overlapping nature of CE
with other English dialects (e.g., SAAE and SWE and
other varieties spoken in England, Ireland, Scotland, and
elsewhere). Table 2 provides a comparative analysis of
CE, SAAE, and SWE, the three dialects that are relevant
to the current work. As can be seen, although some vernacular patterns appear unique to CE, those that Dubois
and Horvath have found to be frequent enough to quantify
are those that also occur in SAAE and SWE. To the sociolinguist, overlapping patterns across dialects are not sur-

prising, and this overlap does little to reduce a dialect's
authenticity or distinctiveness. In fact, sociolinguists
often study the overlapping patterns of dialects to examine the ways in which different internal and external
forces influence a speaker's rate of use and the ways in
which different dialects use the same pattern(s) to express
different meanings, grammatical functions, and pragmatic acts (for examples of the former, see Labov, 1994,
2001; for an example of the latter, see Rickford & Rafal,
1996).
The overlapping nature of CE with SAAE and SWE,
however, has implications for the types of results one can
expect to find with the child dialects studied here. In
particular, if a vernacular difference does exist between
our samples that do and do not have a CE influence, the
overlapping nature of CE, SAAE, and SWE makes it
highly improbable that we will find the difference to be
categorical in nature. Instead, the more likely result will
be a difference that relates to a speaker's rate of use
and/or manner of use. As shown with Myhill's (1988) /r/deletion work, a manner of use difference is often
discussed as linguistic conditioning and this conditioning
relates to the linguistic constraints that are placed on a

Past auxiliary in place of present with progressive forms (e.g., My brother was working for Entergy since high
school) is described, but quantified as a set of low frequency patterns (Cheramie, 1998).

speaker's use of a particular surface pattern (e.g.,
whether /a/ disfavors /r/-deletion). Manner of use differences can also involve the effect a pattern has on the
surrounding language context (e.g., whether /r/ deletion
causes a vowel merger). Of these two possibilities (rate
and manner), a rate-based difference will be the easiest
to detect given that our samples were not collected to systematically examine each target pattern within a wide
range of linguistic contexts. Note also that Dubois and
Horvath have repeatedly used rate-based information to
distinguish CE from other English vernaculars. Indeed,
for most cases of phonology and some cases of morphology, Dubois and Horvath have shown CE to present
higher rates of use than other dialects, especially when
race is controlled within the comparisons.
As a first step toward examining our data, we asked
the following question: Do child speakers of SAAE and

20

SWE who are also perceived to have a CE influence
within their dialects produce higher rates of vernacular
phonology and morphology than other SAAE and SWE
child speakers? Although the earlier listener judgment
task linked perceptions of CE to the children's use of
phonology, findings from the adult studies raised the
possibility that a CE influence could also be identified in
the children's use of morphology.

Method
Data
The data consisted of 93 language samples that were
collected, transcribed, and coded for use in Oetting and
McDonald (2001) and 93 one-minute audiotaped excerpts
from these same samples that were edited for use in

Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research  Vol. 49  16-26  February 2006

Oetting and McDonald (2002). Forty of the samples
were elicited from children who were classified as African
American and speakers of SAAE and 53 were elicited
from children who were classified as White and speakers
of SWE. An equal number of samples were elicited from 6year-olds with specific language impairment (SLI), agematched 6-year-olds with typical language ability (6N),
and language-matched 4-year-olds with typical language
ability (4N). The samples were elicited by having an examiner and child play together with toys and pictures in a
quiet room within each child's school. The average number of complete and intelligible utterances per sample was
216 (SD = 64); the total number in the full data set was
20,171. The mean, median, and mode number of utterances in each 1-min excerpt was 12 (range = 5-19).
Thirty-one of the 93 samples were classified as
presenting an SAAE or SWE dialect with a CE influence,
and the others were classified as presenting an SAAE or
SWE dialect without this influence. For a sample to be
classified as influenced by CE, one or more of the three
listeners had to have written a CE comment on the child's
dialect classification form during the 2002 study. One
rater wrote this type of comment down for 31 of the
excerpts and for 5 of these, a second rater also wrote a
similar comment. The third rater never wrote any type
of dialect comment on her rating forms. Although these
numbers may seem low, recall that the rating form did
not specifically ask the raters to make a judgment about
CE, but instead gave them a blank area to write comments about any other dialects and/or dialect features
that they heard. We also did not provide the raters any
formal training about the possible dialects that were
present on the tapes because we were interested in their
perceptions as blind listeners.
As can be seen in Table 3, a greater proportion of
SAAE speakers were represented in the samples with a
CE influence as compared to those without, but relatively
equal proportions of children with SLI were represented
in the two groups. The bottom four rows of Table 3
provide standardized language test scores, language
sample sizes, and mean lengths of utterance (MLUs)
for the two groups. The samples with and without a CE
influence were not statistically different from each other
on these measures. Although the averages mask the
heterogeneity of the participants, similar findings across
the two groups help rule out potential biases in the
listeners' judgments that may have been related to
perceptions of language ability.

Coding of Vernacular Phonology
and Morphology
There were two phases of data coding. The first
phase involved the 93 one-minute audiotaped excerpts
from the samples, and the second involved the electronic

transcripts of the children's full language samples. The
1-min excerpts were coded for vernacular phonology and
morphology. Phonological coding was completed by a doctoral student in linguistics who trained with Dubois; he
also participated in the coding and analysis of Dubois and
Horvath's (1998, 1999) adult data. The second author of
this paper, a doctoral student in communication disorders, completed the morphological coding. Coding involved listening to each 1-min excerpt and writing down
tokens of vernacular. The list of vernacular patterns
came from Dubois and Horvath's studies and included
nonaspirated stops, substitutions of /t, d/ for /q, 8/, heavy
vowel nasalization, monophthongization, glide weakening of vowels, was leveling, zero regular past, zero is, zero
are, and zero regular third person singular. For phonology, a sixth category titled Other was also provided on
the coding sheet so that the children's use of any other
vernacular pattern that sounded characteristic of CE
could be documented. Two instances of vowel lowering
were identified through the use of this category. Recall
that this pattern had also been independently identified
within the earlier listener judgment task. Although not
studied by Dubois and Horvath, this pattern has been
listed within other adult CE studies (e.g., Rubrecht, 1971;
Walton, 1994).
Both coders worked independently and were encouraged to listen to the tapes multiple times until they felt
comfortable with the coding of each excerpt. Also, given
that the samples had been previously transcribed and
coded for morphology in an electronic format, the second
author examined the electronic files to check her work.
At no time during coding did the coders have access to
the results from the earlier listener judgment study
and to the race, dialect, and language ability status of
the children.

The second phase of coding involved each child's full
language sample. For this analysis, the focus was on
patterns of morphology only. We added this second level
of inquiry because the 1-min excerpts seemed too short
to fully examine this aspect of language. For this coding phase, the second author searched each child's language transcript for was leveling, zero regular past, zero
is, zero are, and zero regular third person singular using
Systematic Analysis of Language Transcript software
(SALT; Miller & Chapman, 1992). Rates of use were calculated by dividing the number of vernacular patterns by
the number of opportunities for the patterns within the
samples. Opportunities were considered all contexts in
which a Standard American English speaker would have
produced were, regular past -ed, is, are, and regular third
person -s. Reliability of the original transcriptions and
morpheme codes were above 90% (for details, see Oetting
& McDonald, 2001).

Results
One-Minute Excerpts
We first examined the proportion of excerpts that
contained at least one of the target patterns of vernacular. For phonology, 87% of the excerpts classified as
presenting CE included at least one vernacular pattern,
whereas only 47% of the excerpts that were not classified
as presenting CE met this criterion. These proportions
were statistically different from each other, c2(93) =
10.36, p = .001,  = 0.33. For morphology, the proportions
of excerpts that contained at least one vernacular pattern
did not differ as a function of CE status; 52% with CE included a vernacular pattern versus 48% without ( = .03,
p > .05). Next, the frequencies at which the vernacular patterns were produced within the excerpts were
examined. For excerpts with and without a CE influence,
the average frequency of vernacular phonology was 5.13
(SD = 4.79) and 2.84 (SD = 4.35), respectively. For vernacular morphology, like averages were 1.21 (SD = 1.74)
and 1.89 (SD = 2.96), respectively. Only vernacular
phonology led to a significant difference for CE status,
F(1, 91) = 5.36, p = .02, h2 = .06.
To further examine the phonology data, we completed a series of three-way analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) for five of the six patterns. Vowel lowering
was excluded because there were not enough tokens to
analyze. The independent variables were the CE influence (present vs. absent), the children's primary dialect
(SAAE vs. SWE), and the children's language ability
status (SLI vs. 6N vs. 4N). For two of the patterns,
nonaspirated stops, F(1, 89) = 5.67, p = .019, h2 = .06, and
glide weakening, F(1, 89) = 4.15, p = .045, h2 = .05,
differences between the excerpts with and without CE
were statistically significant. Also, for three of the

found for the children's language ability. Tukey follow-up
procedures indicated that for both of these patterns, rates
generated by the children with SLI were higher than
those generated by the 6N controls (see Figure 3).

Discussion
Results indicated that the listeners' perceptions of
CE within the SAAE and SWE dialects studied here were
related to the children's use of vernacular phonology.

which the children produced a vernacular form within
these opportunities as a function of the children's CE
status, primary dialect, and language ability classification. As can be seen, effects of a CE influence on the
children's rates of vernacular morphology are not as obvious as they were for phonology. Moreover, the morphology rates appear more affected by the children's
primary dialect and language ability than by their CE
status. To examine these data, three-way ANOVAs
were again used to examine the influence of the three

The 1-min audiotaped excerpts provided three types of
evidence for this claim: (a) The listeners wrote comments
on their rating sheets that tied their perceptions of CE
to vernacular phonology, (b) a greater proportion of excerpts with a CE influence was found to contain one or
more tokens of vernacular phonology than the others,
and (c) the excerpts with a CE influence contained higher
frequencies of vernacular phonology than the others,
with rates of nonaspirated stops and glide reduction
resulting in statistically significant group differences.
In contrast, analysis of both the excerpts and the full
language samples indicated that the listeners' perceptions of CE were unrelated to the children's use of vernacular morphology. Instead, this aspect of language was
related to the children's primary dialect (SAAE vs. SWE)
and their language ability (normal vs. impaired).
The overlapping nature of CE with SAAE and SWE
helps explain why tokens of vernacular phonology were
found in 47% of the excerpts that were not classified as
CE. More difficult to explain are the 13% (n = 4) of excerpts
that were classified as influenced by CE within the
listener judgment task but then did not contain a single
case of vernacular phonology in the current analysis. We
can think of two possible explanations for these findings.
One explanation relates to the reliability of the listener
judgment task. Recall that this task required the raters to
make a number of judgments about the children's dialects
while they listened to a 1-min excerpt. Although we have
argued in previous work that this type of listener judgment task provides a reliable and time efficient way to
characterize the dialects of research participants, it could
very well be the case that this type of data becomes less
reliable when a speaker's idiolect is less prototypical than
others. Given that the children's dialects were far from
being stereotypical cases of CE, a 13% rate of measurement error does not seem unusually high or problematic.
Alternatively, all of the excerpts may have been
correctly classified by the listeners but the scope of our
coding may have limited our ability to identify the full set
of patterns that marked a speaker's dialect as influenced
by CE. Only vernacular patterns of phonology and
morphology were examined even though the listeners'
indicated that vocabulary and paralinguistic features of
the children's dialects sometimes influenced their judgments. Illustrations of CE by native residents and folklorists often include ethnic-flavored words (e.g., cher as a
term of endearment, paren to refer to a grandfather, and
bayou to refer to a slow-moving body of water) as well as a
rhythmic pattern of prosody that is sometimes referred to
as ``flat speech.'' Walton (1994) described this type of
speech as involving shortened words that are produced
with a staccato rhythm and with rising pitch
at the end of utterances. Future studies that control for
utterance content are critical for examining both of these
areas of language. Future studies of vocabulary and

24

prosody may also need to use a different method than an
examiner-elicited language sample with toys because CEspecific vocabulary and prosody may be tied to particular
topics and/or particular speaking partners. Moreover,
prototypical speakers of CE should probably be recruited
for initial studies of these language areas. Although a
comprehensive coding system of all aspects of CE was not
the goal of the current work, this type of research would
facilitate future language variation studies that are completed with children who live in areas where a stereotypical dialect of CE is more prevalent.
Additional studies of CE with children and adults
would be particularly interesting to researchers who
study dialect spread and other issues related to language
variation and change. Take for example, rates of vernacular morphology between Dubois and Horvath's (1999)
young adults who were White CE speakers to those of our
SWE child speakers who presented a CE influence. Recall
that in addition to age differences between their dataset
and ours, the speaker groups also differed in their place of
residency, Cajun ethnicity, and bilingualism status. Their
speakers lived in the heart of the Acadian Triangle, selfidentified as Cajun, and were bilingual; ours lived on the
border, their Cajun ethnicity was unknown, and they
were monolingual speakers of English. Nevertheless, both
groups demonstrated relatively low rates of zero regular
third (19% child vs. 16%-25% adult) and zero is (14% child
vs. 11%-32% adult). In contrast, our child speakers
produced higher rates of was leveling than the adults
(51% child vs. 22%-30% adult) and lower rates of zero
regular past (9% child vs. 29%-48% adult) and zero are
(41% child vs. 72%-73% adult). Additional comparisons of
these dialects and others that are spoken within and
outside of the Acadian Triangle are needed to identify the
factors that have led to these rate differences. This type of
information may also be useful for predicting future
changes in the dialects of this area.
Although the primary goal of the current work was
to identify vernacular patterns of English that corresponded to listener judgments of CE, the findings also
have broader implications for future child language
studies. Recall that a long-term goal of the work was to
identify patterns of vernacular that show systematic
variation across different speaker groups so that a larger,
multidialectal child study can be completed. In pursuit of
this goal, we learned that children's use of phonology is
an important area of language to include within this
future work. Of the six patterns of phonology that were
examined, glide weakening of vowels appears to be the
best candidate for this type of research. Recall that this
pattern was the only one that was affected by both the
children's primary dialect (SAAE vs. SWE) and their use
of CE. To broaden this category, the production of all
vowels may be the appropriate target, especially since
some describe the major phonological difference between

SAAE and SWE as relating to vowel space (for data and
review, see Bailey, 2001).
Although a CE influence was not found for morphology, one might also want to include this aspect of language in a future study, especially if one wants to examine
differences between the surface manifestations of typical
versus atypical sources of language variation. Recall that
the children's use of morphology was affected by both their
primary dialect (SAAE vs. SWE) and their language
ability status (normal vs. impaired), but the effects of
these influences were not identical (for additional evidence and discussion of this issue, see Oetting &
McDonald, 2001, Seymour & Pearson, 2004). If influences
of the former reflect normal sociolinguistic processes and
influences of the latter reflect atypical learning mechanisms, then comparative work that directly pits these two
sources of variation against each other should lead to
different types of language profiles, and the most rigorous
test of this claim would involve patterns of language that
are affected by both influences. The impetus driving
comparative work such as this is to better understand
the nature of each influence by delineating not only what
each one is but also what each one is not.
Of the morphological patterns that were examined
here, the two that were most affected by a childhood
language impairment were zero regular past and zero is.
Both of these patterns have been identified as markers of
SLI in children who speak standard varieties of American English (e.g., Rice & Wexler, 1996). Recall also that
surface manifestations of SLI were not found in the vernacular patterns of phonology. This finding is also predicted by at least one theoretical model of the SLI
condition (e.g., Rice, 2003). Future studies are needed
to test these findings, but if replicated, the current
results would support models of SLI that account for a
significant grammatical weakness involving tense along
with a developmentally and dialect appropriate profile of
phonology.
Finally, the findings of the current work should also
be relevant for future language variation studies that
are conducted outside of Louisiana. While the English
varieties of Louisiana are interesting, multiple dialects of
a language coexist in many other communities in the
United States and elsewhere. What the current work
offers to researchers who are interested in multidialectal
studies (and speaker variation within and across multiple dialects) is the conceptualization of dialect boundaries as not so much based on mutually exclusive lists of
contrasting patterns but instead dependent upon ratebased variation (and probably manner of use variation) of
sets and/or subsets of patterns that cut across the dialects
of interest. A focus on the shared patterns as opposed, or
in addition, to those considered unique to a dialect not
only broadens the number of patterns a researcher can

examine, but also allows the researcher to study the
dialect as a system rather than as a list of isolated surface
structures.
