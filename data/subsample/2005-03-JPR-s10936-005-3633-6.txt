Comprehending Semantic and Grammatical
Violations in Italian. N400 and P600 Comparison
with Visual and Auditory Stimuli
Michela Balconi1,3 and Uberto Pozzoli2
Arguments about the existence of language-specific neural systems and specifically about the
independence of syntactic and semantic processing have focused on the event-related brain measures (ERPs) as tool to monitoring moment-by-moment the cognitive processes underlaid. In
the present experiments, the available evidence indicates that the ERP response to semantic
anomalies is at least partially distinct from the ERP response to syntactic anomalies and that
two distinct processes are activated in sentences comprehension. ERPs were recorded from 10
electrodes while subjects read (Experiment 1) or listened (Experiment 2) to sentences containing semantic or syntactic violations. Final-words that were inconsistent with the sentence
context elicited a negative-going wave at about 400 ms poststimulus, whereas penultimate-word
incongruous with the grammatical structure (subject-verb non-agreement) elicited a positivegoing wave about 600 ms poststimulus. No differences based on the perceptual modality of
the stimulus (visual or auditory) nor different ERP correlates as a function of task-relevance
(explicit/implicit task induction) were found. The implications of our results for Italian language are explained.
KEY WORDS: ERP measure; semantic and syntactic violations; task-relevance; perceptual

INTRODUCTION
Electrophysiological measures of event-related brain potentials (ERPs)
hold great promise as tools for studying the cognitive processes that underlie language comprehension (Garnsey, 1993; Kutas & Van Petten, 1994).

The ERP procedure allows the analysis of the functional differences in
cognition through waveform variations. Specifically, certain endogenous
ERP components appear to be highly sensitive to specific changes in cognitive states. In this line, evidence that syntactic and semantic anomalies
elicit dissimilar patterns of brain activity could be construed as support
for the claim that separable syntactic and semantic processes exist. In a
series of experiments, Kutas and Hillyard (1980) found that semantically
anomalous words in sentences elicit a negative-going wave with a peak
amplitude around 400 ms after the onset of the word and more consistent in posterior right sites. They speculated that the N400 could be a cognitive sign of the reprocessing of semantically anomalous information. In
fact successively (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984) they found that N400 amplitude
vary in function of the "cloze probability" of the word in the sentence:
less expected final words elicited a larger N400 than more predictable completion. More recently Osterhout (1990) and Neville and coll. (1991) have
reported that certain violations of syntactic constraints elicit a measurable
ERP response: a late positive-going wave with an onset around 500 ms
after the anomaly (P600). Specifically, syntactic violations do not show the
same N400 effect seen for semantic anomalies and in the case where N400
was obtained, it likely was not induced by syntactic processes, but was a
consequence of the semantic incongruities resulting from a specific parse
(Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992).
Therefore, violations of semantic and syntactic constraints are clearly
distinct (Osterhout & Nicol, 1999). One basic question concerns the identification of the cognitive processes functionally involved during comprehension. For some theoretical models distinct sets of cognitive processes are
thought to interpret a sentence at each posited level of representation, and
distinct mental representations are claimed to result from these computations. This approach predicts that qualitatively different processing principles for syntax and semantics arise from the existence of qualitatively
different neural processing (Ferreira & Clifton, 1986; Frazier, 1987). This
first perspective advocates an autonomous parser and claims that lexical,
semantic and pragmatic information have their influence only after that
an initial syntactic parse is delivered, which is computed on the basis
of syntactic principles in combination with a limited number of parsing
preferences (Clifton, Speer, & Abney, 1991; Rayner, Garrod, & Perfetti,
1992). In contrast, other models have proposed that a semantic representation is assembled directly, without an intermediate syntactic representation (McClelland, St. John, & Taraban, 1989; Mitchell & Holmes,
1985). In this perspective syntactic information is integrated with lexical or
semantic/pragmatic information in a continuous process of mapping onto
a meaning representation of the whole sentence (MacDonald, Pearlmutter,

Violations in Italian Comprehension

73

& Seidenberg, 1994). The interactive approach claims that non-syntactic
sources of information are used either to direct the parser's initial analysis or to evaluate immediately the outcome of syntactic analysis on a
word-by-word basis during the construction of a semantic representation
of the input (Altman, Garnham, & Dennis, 1992; Spivey-Knowlton &
Tanenhaus, 1994; Taraban & McClelland, 1990). From our point of view,
the identification of different wave variations should invite to consider the
existence of distinct components that intervene in the sentence decoding,
that they are quite diversified phenomena, despite their co-occurrence in
the process of sentence comprehension (Kutas & Federmeier, 2000).
In line with the previous view is the hypothesis that N400 amplitude reflects the build-up of semantic constraint imposed by the sentence
context upon succeeding words (Van Petten & Kutas, 1991). About the
positive-ongoing wave variation (P600), although the syntactic anomalies
examined have elicited a variety of ERP responses, three types of anomaly
have been associated with a widely distributed positive-going wave, specifically phrase-structure violations, subcategorization violation and violation of subjacency (Balconi, 2001a; Garnsey, Tanenhaus, & Chapman,
1989; Kluender & Kutas, 1993; Neville et al., 1991; Osterhout, Holcomb,
& Swinney, 1994). The first hypotheses is that this positive-ongoing wave
is derived by linguistic analysis and that grammatical anomaly produces
this effect (Munte, Matzke, Wieringa, & Johannes, 1998). The second possibility is that it is a member of the family of the late positivity components (P300 family), observed following unexpected, task relevant events
(Coulson, King, & Kutas, 1998). Recent results appear to contrast with
the previous hypotheses, because implicit grammatically judgement produced the P600 effect as well (Osterhout & Hagoort, 1999). The authors
concluded that the pattern of responses to the syntactic violations generates a SPS (Syntactic Positive Shift) indicating the impossibility for the
parser to assign a preferred structure to an incoming string of words
(Hagoort, Brown, & Groothusen, 1993; Osterhout, Mckinnon, Bersick, &
Corey, 1996).
Moreover, in the current research we analyzed a specific sentence-level
context and we cannot generalize our results to the other cognitive processes, as the word-level one. The choice of sentence-level is motivated by
the exigency to compare more strictly the syntactic/semantic information
processing and to explore the dichotomy between structural and semantic
representation of words in the sentence context (Van Petten, 1993). The
principal paradigms of analysis have pointed out the difference between
word-level processes, that considered the recognition of isolated words
(words in single-word context), and sentence-level processes that included
the recognition of words in sentence-context and computation of syntactic

74

Balconi and Pozzoli

structure (Balconi, 2001b; Osterhout & Holcomb, 1995). They constitute
two different processes, first of all for the task that is assigned: the identification, conceptualization and storage in word comprehension are lexical
tasks qualitatively distinct from the sentence decoding, that sets the problem of the word processing in a sentence context. For example, it is necessary to ask if the sentence context influences the earliest stages of word
recognition or these processes are isolated from the effect of context. Specifically, Van Petten (1993) construed the evidence that qualitatively distinct processes underlie the two effects: the N400 for the sentential-context
level had a longer duration but smaller amplitude than for the lexical-level.
With regard to previous research, the small number of studies about
languages different from English make the overall consideration here
adduced more incomplete: it is unclear if ERP response to specific
syntactic/semantic violation can be generalized across different languages
(Kutas & Van Petten, 1994). Therefore, even if these syntactic violations
are the same according to their formal linguistic description, it does not
necessarily mean that have the same consequences for parsing in these languages. A more extended plane of analysis, that includes a larger variety of
linguistic contexts, is actually required. The present research is finalised to
the integration of the previous data, considering the possible effect on the
ERP measures of syntactic and semantic structures for the Italian. Most
of the studies reporting negative-going effect to semantic anomalies have
presented sentences in English, whereas the majority of studies reporting
a P600 effect have presented sentences in English and German.
Specifically, about syntactic anomalies little is known about the effect
of structure violation in Italian language, and here we extends the examination of syntactic analysis into an investigation of these processes during
comprehension of sentences. Although the Italian language shows some
peculiarities if compared with other languages (i.e. gender assignation
based on semantic conceptual information, see Cacciari & Padovani,
2002), it shares many relevant morphosyntactic properties with Spanish, as
well as other Romance languages. As shown by previous result, verb agreement violation (verb is plural, whereas noun phrase is singular) generates
in Spanish a positive shift (P600) in co-occurrence with number violation
(Garcia-Albea, 1999). Moreover, both gender and number agreement violations generated a LAN (left anterior negativity) and a classical P600
effect (Barber & Carreiras, 2002). Our intent is to verify the comparability
of syntactic processing in case of ungrammaticality (subject-verb number
mismatch) for Italian and other languages, as well as to extend this results
to a more general inter-linguistic background (Munte et al., 1998).
Secondly, task sensitivity for N400 effect also was explored in previous studies (Holcomb, 1986). Specifically, the degree of semantic relevance

Violations in Italian Comprehension

75

was varied in order to analyze the effect of voluntariness/automaticity
of the information elaboration in N400. Additional attention to semantic relationship had little impact on the amplitude of the N400 elicited by
unrelated (incongruous) words. This sort of data has led us to consider
the N400 as the standard response to words. More recently the impact
of attentional focus in semantic information elaboration was explored.
In the visual modality the spatial focus of attention was varied in the
different experimental conditions (Kutas, 1993; Nobre & McCarthy, 1993),
whereas in the auditory modality the word were presented in an unattended or attended task (Bentin, Kutas, & Hillyard, 1993). Therefore, at
the present, we can suggest that semantic effects on N400 amplitude are
observed in a variety of conditions but that demand attentional processing
(Balconi, in press). Therefore, the degree of relevance induced for the
semantic/syntactic elaboration task is expected to not greatly influence the
ERPs variations. We suppose that is required only a conscious perception
of the stimuli and a functional cognitive resources allocation (attentional
focus) for the elicitation of N400 and P600 effects (Kutas, 1987) and that
the quality of the cognitive process should not be effected by high/low
task relevance. In addition to the previous issues, other important questions required to be answered. First of all N400 effect has been observed
in the visual modality in a variety of language, including English (Kutas
& Van Petten, 1988), Dutch (Gunter, Jackson, & Mulder, 1992), French
(Ardal, Donald, Meuter, Muldrew, & Luce, 1990), and Japanese (Koyama
et al., 1991). In the auditory modality, N400 effects appears both in comparisons of congruous versus incongruous sentence terminations and for
semantically related versus unrelated words lists (Bentin et al., 1993). Nevertheless, the two perceptual modalities show differences in ERP correlates.
The data suggest that the auditory N400 begins earlier and is longer in
duration (Kutas, Hillyard, & Gazzaniga, 1988). The reason for this difference could be linked to the fact that the extraction of linguistic information from a printed word is likely to exhibit a different time course than
from a spoken word. A printed word can be captured in one visual fixation, whereas an auditory signal is extended in time (Kutas & Van Petten,
1994). Given these disparities, the similarities between auditory and visual
N400 are more striking than the differences. In fact, we hypothesized that
the same morphological properties characterized the two visual/auditory
ERP variations, deriving from the semantic/syntactic information elaboration, and that the comprehension system employes a similar parsing
strategy regardless the modality of the input. Moreover, previous studies
included only some languages and specifically English, Dutch and German
(Coulson et al., 1998), whose results are not directly extendible to others
linguistic contexts.

Balconi and Pozzoli

Therefore, in order to explore the effect of perceptual modality in
syntactic/semantic information processing, two different experiments were
realized: visual and auditory stimuli were considered for the sentence-level
condition. In particular, in line with previous results, we suppose that both
the visual (Experiment 1) and auditory (Experiment 2) stimuli can generate
similar N400/P600 effects. The two modalities of stimulation should induce
a negative-going wave in concomitance with semantic anomalies in sentence
processing, as well as a positive-going wave for the syntactic anomalies.
EXPERIMENT 1
Method
Participants
Twenty one students (12 were female and 9 male, mean aged 22.7)
enrolled at the Psychology Faculty of the Catholic University of Milan
took part in the experiment. They were native Italian subjects with normal
vision and all right-handed. Two different experimental conditions were
provided, with an explicit or an implicit task (see Procedure section), and
participants were distributed across the two tasks.
Materials
Stimulus materials consisted of 90 sentences randomized for the
sequence. Three subsets were considered: 30 semantically and grammatically congruous sentence, 30 semantically incongruous and 30 syntactically
incongruous sentences. Congruous sentences were defined as semantically
coherent and grammatically correct. Incongruous sentences were defined
as those which were semantically anomalous or which were judged as
ungrammatical. The semantically anomalous sentences consist of sentences
with no sense terminal word. The syntactic violation consists of sentences
in which the subject and the finite verb do not agree in number (singular subject noun, plural verb form). In particular, we took the past participle as the critical word. The words in each incongruous sentence (semantic
and syntactic) were identical to those in its congruous control, except for
the critical word which contains the anomaly. Example of each type and
their controls are displayed:
Semantic violation
(1) a. La lepre nel campo e *dipinta (The hare in the field is *painted).
b. La lepre nel campo e veloce (The hare in the field is fast).

77

Verb agreement violation
(2) a. La porta dell'ufficio *sono aperte (The door of the office *are open).
b. La porta dell'ufficio e aperta (The door of the office is open).
The sequence of 90 sentences did not contain filler items, following the
procedure adopted in previous experiment (Coulson et al., 1998). The frequency of the occurrence and the words length were controlled, because of
the potential effect of these two factors for the N400/P600 components.
The sentences were pre-tested in pre-experimental phase, in which
11 subjects (not experimental subjects) were instructed to answer if they
perceived any semantic/syntactic violation in the sentences. The results
of the pre-test showed the correct attribution for the congruous/incongruous conditions. The congruous sentences were valued as syntactically and semantically coherent (on a 5 point Likert scale--5 maximally
congruous/1 minimally congruous--M = 4.91); semantically incongruous
sentences were considered anomalous (M = 1.41), and the syntactically
incongruous sentences as ungrammatical (M = 1.88). To ensure the relevance and the right comprehension of the congruous/incongruous conditions, in a post-experiment validation the same subjects who participated
to the experiment were invited to value the congruence/incongruence of
the sentences. The judgement of the subjects were analogous to the preexperiment trend. In fact, the correct attribution for the congruous sentences was high (M = 4.81). On the contrary, the semantically (M = 1.12)
and syntactically (M = 1.24) incongruous sentences were judged, respectively, semantically anomalous and ungrammatical.
As previous researches revealed, the choice of the terminal position
appears to have a different effect on the ERP correlates with respect to
the intermediate position of incongruous word (Osterhout & Holcomb,
1995; Van Petten & Kutas, 1991). In this context we opted for incongruous words at the end position of the sentence. Moreover, it must be noted
that errors of number agreement are quite different and specific from
the other syntactic anomalies associated with overall sentence structure
or verb subcategorization violation (Hagoort et al., 1993). Specifically, in
Italian language subject-verb may not agree in gender (with incongruous
word suffixing at the ending of the word) or in number (with incongruous
concordance plural-singular) (Cacciari & Padovani, 2002).
Procedure
Each subject was instructed to pay attention to each stimulus and
to focus on comprehending the whole sentence. In the pre-experimental

78

Balconi and Pozzoli

phase, subjects were provided with a few examples of syntactically and
semantically incongruous sentences. No sentences presented during the
experiment were used as examples. The comprehension of the task was
tested and additional examples were provided if required. Two different
experimental conditions were provided, and the participants were distributed across two tasks. For the first condition, with an implicit task, no
additional task more than the general instruction was imposed. For the
second condition, with an explicit task, the subjects were told that some
sentences would be semantically or grammatically incongruous, without
any other information about the type of anomaly, and that they had to
take attention to these anomalies.
All tasks were performed in a quit darkened room, facing a CRT. The CRT
was approximately 100 cm away from the subject. Sentences were presented one
word at time in the center of a screen and each word was displayed in white letter
(font and letter size of 3 cm) against a dark background. The stimulus duration
was of 200 ms, with an ISI interval of 300 ms. Inter-sentence length was constant (400 ms), with the same dark background. Word-by-word presentation is
far removed from the usual manner of reading, and it could be that this mode of
presentation encourages subjects to adopt unnatural strategies for reading the
sentences (Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992, 1993). Nevertheless, in this study we
are not directly interested in analysis of continuous speech effect (Osterhout &
Holcomb, 1993) but in the ERPs which were time-locked to the presentation of
the word which made the sentence incongruous. Moreover, this procedure satisfies the necessity to plan a functional time-interval between the words for the
ERP registration and to make not overlapping the ERP components (Coulson,
et al., 1998).
EEG was measured with an Electrocap, with 10 electrodes activated
(international 10-20 system; Jasper, 1958), placed at four midline sites
(FZ, CZ, PZ, and OZ), at right or left frontal (F3 and F4), temporal (T3
and T4) and parietal (P3 and P4) sites, all referred to linked earlobes.
All single trial waveforms were screened for eye movements, electrodes
drifting and EMG artifacts, with electrodes placed above and below the
right eye. Trial contaminated by eyes movements or muscle artifact were
discarded. EEG was amplified using the NeuroScan SYNAMP 4.0 data
acquisition system, with filter band pass setting of 0.01-100 Hz and sampled at a rate of 250 Hz, and stored for subsequent averaging. Epochs were
comprised of the 100 ms preceding and 1900 ms following stimulus presentation. Approximately 7% of the trials were rejected.
Data Analysis and Results
The N400 component of the ERP was quantified as the mean voltage of the peak in a latency range of 300-500 ms poststimulus relative

Violations in Italian Comprehension

79

to a 100 ms prestimulus baseline. The P600 component was quantified in
the same manner, in a latency range of 500-700 ms poststimulus. The second measure considered is the latency, that reproduces the latency of the
peak detected for each of the two time-windows. Averaged waveforms were
computed by subject over the congruous and incongruous sentences, for
each of the three experimental conditions. The time-window reference is a
common procedure that allows to measure the average variation around a
peak, in line with the results of previous researches and visual inspection
of the obtained waveforms (Garnsey, 1993; Rugg & Coles, 1995).
All the statistical measures to be reported consisted of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA for repeated measures) with the amplitude and the latency measures used separately as dependent variables.
As the independent variables were considered the within-subject factors
recording site (10) and the condition (3), and the between-subject factor
type of task (2). ERP effect typically varies in amplitude from one recording site to another: consequently, most of the main effect of condition
were accompanied by interaction between condition and recording site, as
well as main effect of recording site. We didn't report data in the case of
a significant interaction between site and condition in absence of a main
effect for condition, because they did not elucidate the effect of experimental condition (Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992).
Semantic Negative-ongoing Variation (N400)
For the dependent variable of peak amplitude, the ANOVA for
repeated measures revealed the presence of the main effect of condition
[F (2, 20) = 2.76, p < .01] and electrodes [F (9, 20) = 8.32, p < .01].
No main effect for task nor for two- or three-way interactions were found.
The three experimental conditions showed differences between the semantic incongruous sentences and the other two sets of sentences.
The next table (Table I) reports the mean values and the standard
deviations for the three different conditions, distinct for amplitude and
latency measures.
A successive post hoc analysis (repeated measure ANOVA for contrast)
applied to the condition factor revealed that the semantic incongruous condition had a more negative peak at the latency of 428 ms than the syntactic
incongruous condition [F (1, 20) = 21.21, p < .01] and congruous condition
[F (1, 20) = 7.95, p < .01)]. The Figure 1 shows the grand average ERPs for
the three experimental conditions (-100/800 ms time window).
For the latency dependent measure, no significant effect of the experimental factors was found. In fact only the electrode sites show a statistical
significance. No other main effect (condition and type of task) or two- and
three-way interactions revealed a different trend of the data.

In order to analyze more deeply the effect of lateralization (right/left)
and localization (anterior, central and posterior sites) of the ERP variations, an additional ANOVA for repeated measures was conducted considering the three factors lateralization (2) condition (3) and localization
(3) for each of the dependent variables, the amplitude and the latency
measures. For the amplitude measure, although the mean profiles showed
a more negative variation for the posterior (Pz) sites than for the anterior (Fz and Cz) in the semantic incongruous condition, no main effect,
except for the condition, nor the interactions were significant at the
ANOVA. The Figure 2 reports the grand average for the three registration
sites.
In parallel, the latency measure did not show any significant effect for
the independent variables considered.
Syntactic Positive-going Wave Variation (P600)
For the 500-700 temporal window, an ANOVA for repeated measures
was applied to the data. The wave variation for the amplitude showed the
significance of some of the main effects, the condition [F (2, 20) = 7.89,
p < .01] and electrodes [F (9, 20) = 2.34, p < .01]. No other two- or threeway interactions are statistically significant.
Table II reports the mean values and the standard deviations for the three
conditions, for both the amplitude and the latency dependent measures.
The contrast analysis applied to the main effect of condition showed
a different wave profile for the syntactic incongruous condition with
respect to semantic incongruous [F (1, 20) = 7.21, p = .01] and congruous sentences [F (1, 20) = 6.89, p = .02]. Specifically, a higher amplitude

The ANOVA applied to the latency measure showed the significance
of only one of the main effects, the condition factor [F (2, 20) = 9.53,
p < .01]. In fact, as the Figure 1 reveals, the syntactically incongruous
sentences presented a more delayed positive-ongoing variation with respect
to the other two conditions. The successive contrast analysis revealed that
the syntactic incongruous condition had a more positive peak at about
650 ms poststimulus, than the other two experimental conditions (congruous [F (1, 20) = 6.65, p = .01] and semantic incongruous [F (1, 20) = 5.45,
p = .02]: the last two presented a more anticipated peak, respectively at
597 ms and 608 ms postimulus. No other main effects or interactions were
significant.
The lateralization and localization effects were tested in a successive
ANOVA for repeated measures (lateralization x condition x localization).
For the amplitude variable, no factors, nor their interactions were statistically significant. Therefore, the SPS variation showed a distributed effect
on the scalp surface. In the mean time, the ANOVA applied to the latency
variable did not reveal any significant effect of the three factors lateralization, condition and localization.
Discussion
The results of the current research allow us to suppose that violation of semantic or pragmatic constraints is quite distinct from violation of
syntactic constraints (Osterhout & Holcomb, 1995). Two morphologically

distinct ERPs have been found, correlated to different types of linguistic
anomalies, one related to syntactic incongruity, and one related to semantic incongruity. The two phenomenon are representative, on one side, of
a grammatical violation, the subject-verb agreement; on the other, of the
failure in the attribution of semantic value to the sentence, due to the
inconsistency between word and its sentence-context. The two different
ERP correlates appear distinctive not overlapping phenomenon, related to
the process of reading sentences. More generally we can conclude that
sentence comprehension involves more than simply retrieving word meaning: the sentence comprehension also requires an analysis of constituent
structure, that is, an analysis of the relative ordering of words in the sentence and of the grammatical roles played by these words (Garnsey, 1993).
Specifically, grammatical and semantic violations showed similar effects
observed in previous research on English, Dutch and Spanish languages
(Friederici, 2002; Gunter et al., 1992). These results make us more sure
that language comprehension activates analogous processes despite the
inter-linguistic differences and that the independence of syntactic/semantic
ways is a more general principle than a linguistically-confined effect.
Moreover, the two linguistic electroencephalographic correlates
appeared independent from the task-relevance, with respect to the salience
of the congruency/incongruity of the sentence (Kutas, 1993; Nobre &
McCarthy, 1993). In fact, on one side, the lack of a specific task to recognize the anomalies does not seem to affect the presence of a negative
or a positive-ongoing waves; on another, the experimental induction of
an explicit task does not produce a variation in the ERP profile, with
respect to peak measure of amplitude and of latency. Although previous
researches have underlined the independence of the N400 effect from the
linguistic relevance of the recognition task, less empirical data have been
advanced for the positive-ongoing variation P600 (Kutas & Van Petten,
1994). The question about the effect of the information processing induction on the P600 correlate appears only at the beginning. Nevertheless, like
for the semantic-message level, the grammatical decoding seems an automatic and immediate response to the perception of a syntactic incongruity.
In the present context, both the N400 and the P600 effects appear related to
a spontaneous decoding, automatically activated by comprehension of the
sentence and by evaluation of the stimulus.
A differential morphological property of the two ERP correlates is
related to the scalp distribution of the waves. In fact, whereas the P600 effect
appears more homogeneously distributed on the recording sites, without
a precise localization and right/left lateralization, the N400 effect presents
locational specificity, almost regards to the spatial anterior/posterior
dichotomy: a higher amplitude for the negative peak in the posterior site

(Pz) was found with respect to the central and anterior sites (Kutas et al.,
1988). A more interesting effect is the presence of a delayed peak for the
SPS in the co-occurrence with the syntactic anomaly: as our results suggest, the syntactic anomaly detection produces a P650 peak, with a more
delayed positive-ongoing wave than the other two experimental conditions.
The "temporal deferring" effect could be attributed to the more complex
process of syntactic anomaly detection in comparison with the congruence
condition. Almost in the present research, the presence of a delayed peak
appears strictly linked to the linguistic decoding of syntactic incongruity.
EXPERIMENT 2
In a second experiment we explored the possible effects of the perceptual characteristics of the stimulus for the semantic and syntactic
comprehension process, and we compared the visual to the auditory stimulation condition (Hagoort & Brown, 2000; Kutas, 1993; Kutas, Neville, &
Holcomb, 1987). In fact, we hypothesize that the cognitive high-order process of semantic and syntactic analysis are invariant and they induce a quite
similar ERP variation in both the visual and the auditory condition (Kutas,
Van Petten, & Besson, 1994). As in the previous experiment, two different
experimental conditions were provided (implicit and explicit task).
Method
Participants
Eighteen students (9 female and 9 male) enrolled at the Psychology
Faculty in the Catholic University of Milan participated in the experiment.
The mean age was 23.6 (range 21-26) and they were native Italian speakers with normal audition, and all right-handed.
Materials and Procedure
The overall experimental procedure was analogous to the Experiment 1.
As in the previous experiment, the materials were also presented in two tasks
mode, implicit versus explicit, across the subjects. The Experiment 2 was
conduced in the same quit darkened room of the previous. Two speakers
were placed behind at the right and left of the subject at a distance of 30 cm
from him. The volume was not too much low but distinctly audible. The sentences heard had a variable duration between 3 and 4 sec. As in the visual
condition, they were submitted in a word-by-word audio presentation, with
an ISI interval of 300 ms and an inter-sentences interval of 400 ms.
The sentences used in the previous experiment were adopted and the
visual material was translated into the auditory stimuli. A reader (a young

86

Balconi and Pozzoli

female), previously trained, recorded the 90 sentences used in the Experiment 1. She was invited to maintain the same register and speech profile
for all the sentences, and to be natural in her speaking, without introducing vocal variants between the sentences. The overall duration of the sentences, the time parameter, like pauses, and speech articulation rate, and
the vocal parameters, like pitch profile and loud, were controlled using the
digital CSL (Computerized Speech Lab) apparatus. This procedure gives
specific control of the parameter of F0 (Fundamental Frequency), duration of syllables and overall word length.
Eight judges evaluated the naturalness of the speech in a pre-experimental phase. Moreover, the same subjects tested the congruous/incongruous value of the sentences. As in the Experiment 1, the subjects recognized
the congruous (M = 4.69), the semantic (M = 1.09) and the syntactic incongruous sentences (M = 1.21). In parallel, the 18 experimental
subjects, submitted to the evaluation in a post-experimental questionnaire,
agreed with the pre-test evaluation (for congruous M = 4.77, semantic
incongruous M = 1.22 and syntactic incongruous M = 1.40 conditions).
The same procedure of the Experiment 1 was adopted. Epochs were
comprised of the 100 ms preceding and 1900 ms following stimulus presentation. Also in this case also approximately 6% of the epochs were rejected
for the eye or EMG artifacts.

Data Analysis and Results
Semantic Negative-ongoing Variation (N400)
Table III represents the mean values and the standard deviations of
the two dependent variables for the first temporal window, distinct for
condition.
A three-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to the peak
amplitude and latency measures for the temporal windows of 300-500 ms.
Specifically, the ANOVA (electrodes x condition x task) showed the significance of the two main effects, condition [F (2, 17) = 7.12, p = .01]
and electrodes [F (9, 17 = 12.63, p < .01]. Type of task did not appear
significant, nor the two- or three-way interactions. A following repeated
measures ANOVA for the contrast allowed us to compare the three experimental conditions. The semantic incongruous sentences showed a different
profile from syntactic incongruous [F (1, 17) = 11.12, p < .01] and congruous sentences [F (1, 17) = 5.71, p = .03], with a more negative peak
at about 400 ms poststimulus. Figure 3 indicates the grand average of the
epochs for the three different conditions.

The ANOVA applied to the latency variable did not show a significant difference for the condition, electrodes or task factors, nor for their
possible interactions. The temporal patterns of the wave variation was,
therefore, the same for all the experimental variables.
Moreover, the ANOVA for repeated measures applied to the three
factors, lateralization (2), condition (3) and localization (3) for to the amplitude measure revealed the presence of a significant main effect for localization, as well as for its interaction with the condition factor. In order to
explain the interaction effect, we applied a post hoc comparison (the Tukey
Test) to the two simple effects. For the first (comparing the three conditions
in each electrode sites), we found that in the posterior site (Pz) the semantic incongruous condition produced a more negative peak at about 400 ms
poststimulus in comparison with syntactic incongruous [F (1, 17) = 9.05,
p < .01] and congruous sentences [F (1, 17) = 4.55, p = .04]. On the contrary, the anterior (Fz) and central sites (Cz) respectively did not present
different negative-ongoing waves related to the three experimental conditions. Moreover, for the second simple effect (comparing the three electrodes in each condition), the posthoc analysis revealed a more negative
peak for the Pz site with respect to the Fz [F (1, 17) = 9.08, p < .01] and
no differences for Cz/Pz comparison [F (1, 17) = 1.32, p = .12] and Fz/Cz
comparison [F (1, 17) = 2.07, p = .10] in the semantic incongruous condition.The congruous and syntactic incongruous did not show significant
differences for the two-paired comparisons. The next figures (Figure 4a-c)
show the grand average for the anterior/central/posterior sites for each of
the the experimental conditions.
The independent variables considered did not show any significant
effect for the latency dependent measure.

With respect to the amplitude, the ANOVA revealed the main effect
of condition [F (2, 17) = 20.13, p < .01] and electrode sites [F (9, 17) =
18.63, p < .01]. On the contrary, no effect was found for the type of
task, and not for the two-three-way interactions. Specifically, at the contrast analysis the syntactic incongruous condition showed a different wave
profile in comparison with both the semantic incongruous [F (1, 17) =
10.87, p < .01] and congruous sentences [F (1, 17) = 12.40, p < .01]. The
grammatically incongruous sentences produced, in fact, a more positivegoing wave at about 638 post stimulus latency, as shown in Figure 2.
The ANOVA applied to the latency dependent variable did not report
any significant effect, except for the electrodes site [F (9, 17) = 30.56,
p < .01]. Moreover, the analysis of the lateralization and the localization
effects (lateralization x condition x localization) did not allow to define
adifferent distribution of the SPS on the scalp. The scalp map was homogeneous for the latency parameter too, without significant temporal differences of the peak in the sites of registration.

Perceptive Modality Comparison
A direct comparison of the data from the two experiments shows that
the visual and auditory presentation modes are not differentiated. A more
specific comparison between the two modalities of stimulation was conduced by an ANOVA for repeated measures for modality (2) x condition
(3) x localization (3), separately for the two temporal windows and for the
two dependent variables of amplitude and latency of the peak. For the
peak amplitude measure in the N400 window the condition effect was
significant [F (2, 28) = 12.62, p < .01], with more negative peak in the
semantic incongruous condition, against the absence of differences for the
visual/auditory condition [F (1, 38) = 1.16, p = .27] and for the localization
effect [F (1, 38) = 2.09, p = .43]. In parallel, the P600 effect did not show
different means as a function of the modality [F (1, 38) = 1.51, p = .49]
and localization factor [F (1, 38) = 1.49, p = .40] but only for the condition effect [F (2, 36) = 21.23, p < .01], with more positive peak in the
syntactic incongruous sentences.
For the latency variable, no main effect nor their interactions were
significant for the N400 effect. On the contrary, for the P600 the more
delayed peak observed in the syntactic incongruous condition was detected
in this comparison, with statistical significance of the condition factor
[F (2, 38) = 11.82, p < .01]. A more delayed peak was found in the syntactic incongruous condition in comparison with the semantic incongruous
and congruous sentences.

Discussion
The results observed in the previous experiment were confirmed in the
second experiment with auditory stimuli. As in the visual condition, the
N400 and P600 effect appeared linked to specific linguistic semantic anomalies, on one side, and to the grammatical-level, on the other. More specifically, the profile of the N400 effect appeared at all overlapping with
the negative-ongoing variation effect observed for the visual stimuli, considering both the peak amplitude and the latency components (Friederici,
2002). The absence of morphological differences for both the amplitude
and the latency parameters does invite to conclude in favor of a coincidence between the cognitive processes linked to the information elaboration in visual/auditory context. With respect to the peak localization, even
if the right/left distinction is not significant for our data, a more marked
effect is related to the second spatial map, the frontal/posterior distribution. Specifically, the strong association between the posterior site and the
N400 effect makes it likely that this area is appointed for the semantic
information elaboration.
In parallel, the SPS revealed in the Experiment 1 was linked to
the grammatical incongruous condition (not agreement subject-verb). The
morphological profile of the SPS is similar to the ERPs produced in the
visual condition. The same amplitude and latency parameters characterize
the positive-ongoing wave, with a more delayed peak in the syntactic
incongruous sentences compared to the other two experimental conditions. Previous studies of Neville et al. (1991) provided evidence consistent with the claim that the P600 is associated with syntactic anomaly,
rather than other aspect of the sentence processing. In fact, in our research
the inconsistency of the sentence with a "preferred" structural analysis
elicited a widely distributed positive-going wave (the P600 effect), even
if not specific for electrodes site, with a homogeneous effect all over the
recording sites. Moreover, the inter-linguistic specificity of the two semantic and syntactic processes was observed in the Experiment 2. In parallel
with some previous results, auditory comprehension of semantic syntactic
anomalies elicited two different ERP variations, quite similar to the N400
and P600 effects noticed in other linguistic domains (Brown, van Berkum,
& Hagoort, 2000; Garcia-Albea, 1999; Hagoort et al., 1993).
Also in the auditory condition, both the negative variation and the
positive shift occurred in absence of any task other than the request to
read the sentence. The unspecificity of the task is particularly important
for the P600, related to the question of the linguistic nature of the SPS.
The fact that we observed the positive shift in the absence of an explicit
evaluation task demands also makes a "surprise account" of the observed

positivity less likely (Coulson et al., 1998; Osterhout et al., 1996). In
particular, the possibility that the SPS is a member of the P300 family
becomes less probable in the light of the present study (Hagoort et al.,
1993). If we assume that subject anticipates grammaticality when reading
or listening to sentences, than perceived ungrammaticality might act as an
"unexpected event", eliciting a P300 component or similar effect. Indeed,
previous studies, in line with our results, observed positivity similar to
those reported here in response to syntactic violations when no explicit
judgement of syntactic acceptability was required (Balconi, 2000; Hagoort
et al., 1993).

GENERAL DISCUSSION
Our results allows us to speculate that the N400 and the P600 are
elicited as a function of the representational level of the anomaly, semantic and syntactic, respectively (Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992). In particular,
the N400 component might be a response to the semantic or message-level
anomaly associated with the incongruous sentences. Previous researches
have suggested that N400 amplitude may be a signal of semantic or lexical
priming between context and the word (Holcomb & Neville, 1990) or of
the semantic constraints engendered by context (Kutas, 1993; Van Petten
& Kutas, 1991). In the current research, we suggest that the N400 amplitude might be determined by the difficulty in integrating linguistic material at a semantic-message level: therefore, it appears to be related to the
sentence-level and not only to the word-level (Kluender & Kutas, 1993).
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that multiple N400 components exist,
regardless to the fact that different wave-forms have been observed in
function of short/long property of the unacceptable sentence (Osterhout &
Holcomb, 1995).
Similar considerations can be made for the SPS. Some authors had
found a difference between the explicit/implicit task condition in positivegoing wave production, with an hypothetical P300-like wave in the latter condition (Coulson et al., 1998). On the contrary, for other authors
(Osterhout & Hagoort, 1999; Osterhout et al., 1996) it is not excluded that
one unexpected and irrelevant event might have elicited the positive-going
component. In line with our experiments, the claim that P600 could be
sensitive to syntactic anomaly and also be a member of the P300 family
is quite improbable. In fact, whereas the amplitude of the P300 is proportional to the unexpectedness of a task relevant stimuli, we have found that
the P600 can occur even if the number-agreement violation is not relevant
for the experimental task.

Secondly, the results of the present research allow us to extend the previous data to the Italian language. In fact, we have obtained similar wave
variations, both for the semantic and the syntactic anomalies, observed in
other linguistic contexts. The inter-linguistic homogeneity of the two ERPs
is valid tool for explaining the linguistic valence of ERPs. In fact, our second
goal was to determine whether the ERP response to syntactic and semantic anomalies are independent from specific linguistic context, in addition
to being qualitatively distinct processes (De Vincenzi & Di Matteo, 2001).
We analyzed this question by showing that these anomalies have analogous
effects on Italian language in comparison with other language previously
explored. Regardless of the interpretation of the results reported in the literature, the results reported here demonstrate that the N400 and the P600 are
consistently distinctive under the experimental condition used here. Moreover, the application of the N400 and P600 effect to other linguistic domains
is a next main objective of the future experimental research.
Two more issues remain to be considered. The first issue is relative to
the lack of the modality-stimulus effect. In opposition to other experimental
evidences (Holcomb & Neville, 1990), the visual/auditory conditions showed
a homogeneous effect on the ERP measures, for both the amplitude and the
latency parameters. First, the late cognitive class of these ERP phenomenon
may not make surprising the lack of differences contingent on the modality
of input. Second, for the P600 effect, we can conclude that our results are
consistent with the claim that P600 is an electrophysiological marker of the
syntactic anomaly, one which occurs both during reading and auditory language comprehension. One additional conclusion may be added: P600 effect
was elicited in both modalities, suggesting that the comprehension system
employs a similar parsing strategy regardless of the modality of the input
(Osterhout & Holcomb, 1993).
Finally, we have to consider the problem of the task-specificity of
ERP variation or the role of an attentional mechanism in the semantic/syntactic decoding. As underlined by some authors, task sensitivity can
be considered as a cue of functional distinctiveness of the ERP correlates
(Osterhout & Hagoort, 1999). Manipulation of task-salience condition has
furnished a clear evidence that the P600 and the N400 effect are relatively
independent from the degree of relevance of the linguistic task. Substantially, the salience of the violation does not predict the size of both the
negative- positive-ongoing variations (Hagoort et al., 1993). The results of
the present research appear to confirm this trend, with a task-insensitivity
of the N400 and P600 effects.
At the end, until we know more about these underlying processes, stronger inferences about the separability and modularity of linguistic processes
remain premature for the Italian language. From our results we have not

enough data in favor or contrasting the previous theoretical perspectives
of integrative processing or autonomous parser. Nevertheless, the more
extreme version of the integrative view, that refuses the existence of a syntactic level of elaboration, is not in line with the distinctiveness of the
two ERPs here observed. A syntactic parser may have a proper role in
the message-level comprehension (Osterhout & Hagoort, 1999), even if,
on the basis of these results, we cannot make strong claims about the temporal relation between parsing operations and semantic/syntactic integration
processes. In fact, although the onset of negative shift seems to be earlier
than the onset of the syntactic positive shift, this in itself does not provide
with conclusive evidence about the time-course of the underlying processes.
Not enough is known about the temporal origin of processes resulting in
endogenous ERP components with specific latency characteristics, such as
time of onset and time of maximum amplitude (Hagoort et al., 1993).
