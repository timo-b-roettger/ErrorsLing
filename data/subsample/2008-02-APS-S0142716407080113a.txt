ABSTRACT
The performance of 8- to 13-year-old monolingual English-speaking children with language impairment (LI) on seven nonlinguistic tasks was compared with two groups of typically developing children,
monolingual English-speaking children, and proficient Spanish-English sequential bilingual children.
Group differences were apparent, with a key finding that the LI group was observably slower than both
typical groups in mental rotation and arithmetic, and also slower than the typical monolingual group
in odd man out, pattern matching, and form completion. Overall, the response time (RT) increased
equivalently across groups as task difficulty increased. Chronological age and perceptual-motor speed
contributed to task performance, especially for the shorter tasks. RT trajectories across the 6-year age
span showed that task RT decreased with age, but with greater variability for longer tasks that may
also be more vulnerable to the effect of experience.

Increasing attention is being paid to the behavioral phenotype of children identified with developmental language difficulties in the native language. Children
with primary (or specific) language impairment (LI) constitute about 7% of the
young monolingual English-speaking population in the United States (Tomblin
et al., 1997), and present an interesting case because the language difficulty is not
secondary to conditions such as hearing loss, developmental delay, neurological
insult, or environmental differences or deprivation. The search for a more refined
phenotype is taking place within broader investigation of whether LI subgroups
have overlapping performance profiles with other populations, including children
with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and attention-deficit disorder
(American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 1998; Tager-Flusberg,
2004). There also is the longstanding debate about whether LI forms a discrete
clinical population and/or represents societal concern about below-average language performance (Leonard, 1987; Tomblin, 2006).

Although language performance is, by definition, the central deficit in LI, several
factors speak against an exclusive focus on language to inform the LI phenotype
(Windsor & Kohnert, in press). These include a changing profile of salient spoken
language deficits during development, the differential influence of the specific
languages or dialects to be learned, and of key relevance here, the issue that a robust
phenotypic description is one that is reliable across diverse groups (McMahon,
1999). Language characteristics do not appear to be sufficient to identify LI in
the face of diversity. In particular, when typically developing sequential bilinguals
have been compared with monolingual children with LI on traditional language
measures in the second language, considerable overlap between the two groups
has been found (Hakansson & Nettelbladt, 1996; Paradis, Crago, Genesee, & Rice,
2003).
One reason that conventional measures such as standardized tests and language
samples may fail to separate children with LI from typical language learners is that
language is a highly experience-dependent ability that relies on cumulative, acquired knowledge. Performance in any given language reflects linguistic, cultural,
educational, social, and world experiences in addition to the underlying integrity
of an individual's cognitive system. When the experiential component of language
is reduced by using highly familiar or novel stimuli, language-based tasks such as
nonword repetition have been found to identify LI reliably in racially, culturally, or
dialectically diverse groups. For example, Campbell, Dollaghan, Needleman, and
Janosky (1997) and Ellis Weismer, Evans, and Hesketh (1999) found no difference
in nonword repetition performance by "majority" (White) children and "minority"
(primarily African American) children. Rodekohr and Haynes (2001) found no
reliable differences between African American English-speaking children and
their mainstream peers in nonword repetition and listening span.
However, these same measures do not identify LI reliably in linguistically
diverse groups (Kohnert, Windsor, & Yim, 2006; Windsor & Kohnert, 2004).
The purpose of the current study is to explore whether nonlinguistic performance
may inform the LI phenotype. Specifically, we were interested in which, if any
nonlinguistic tasks would separate monolingual children with LI from two groups
of children with intact language systems, including typically developing sequential
bilingual children as well as monolingual children.
A range of causal mechanisms have been proposed for LI, some of which address
nonlinguistic correlates. Proposals that address nonlinguistic status range from,
for example, the idea of LI as an instance of neuromaturational delay (Bishop &
Edmundson, 1987) to a focus on difficulties in elementary cognitive operations
and/or working memory (e.g., Kail, 1994) to the hypothesis of an atypical procedural memory system in LI (Ullman & Pierpoint, 2005). Our approach in examining
nonlinguistic performance has been to take a broader perspective that allows for
examination of a variety of instances of typical and atypical language learning.
That is, in better defining the phenotype, we initially do not want to a priori reify
unique causal mechanisms of LI, especially when there is considerable debate
about the nature of this group.
Instead, we draw on a general framework of cognitive-linguistic processing in
which individual differences in language performance emerge from a developing
biological system interacting with differential language and social experiences.

This framework is in line with approaches that emphasize both biological and
experiential factors, such as those proposed in various ways by MacDonald and
Christiansen (2002), Tomasello (2003), and Karmiloff-Smith (2007). This approach enables us to place LI and intact bilingual and monolingual performance
within the one framework. This approach also could incorporate other instances
of language learning, such as gifted language learning as well as language breakdowns in genetic disorders, in impoverished environments, and in attachment
disturbances (Windsor & Kohnert, in press).
NONLINGUISTIC DEFICITS IN LI

Nonlinguistic performance is of interest because of the repeated findings of subclinical nonlinguistic correlates of LI, especially in response time (RT). In what
appears to be the first RT examination of nonlinguistic performance in LI, Johnston and Ellis Weismer (1983) found that children with LI performed a mental
rotation task as accurately as age peers but more slowly. More recent research
has supported the finding that monolingual children with LI tend to be slower (at
the group level) to complete a range of speeded nonlinguistic tasks than typical
monolingual age peers (Miller, Kail, Leonard, & Tomblin, 2001; Miller et al.,
2006; Windsor, Milbrath, Carney, & Rakowski, 2001).
One study, by Kohnert and Windsor (2004), has examined the utility of nonlinguistic detection tasks to identify LI in linguistically diverse groups. The participants were 8- to 13-year-old monolingual children with and without LI and
typically developing sequential bilingual Spanish-English speakers who had high
proficiency in both languages. The monolingual children with LI were slower to
perform a choice visual detection task than both typical groups. The LI group also
was slower than the typical monolingual group in a simple visual and a choice
auditory detection task. The bilingual group approximated the performance of
the typically developing monolingual group in these two tasks; however, their
performance was not separated statistically from the LI group. There was no
group difference in the simple auditory detection task.
Although the finding that children with LI might be separated from typically
developing bilingual and monolingual peers on some nonlinguistic tasks is intriguing, there are at least four issues to consider in examining the nonlinguistic profile
in LI in a way that helps to characterize a behavioral phenotype. This includes
the role of experience, the influence of perceptual-motor speed in higher level
nonlinguistic tasks, the effect of task difficulty, and the impact of development on
nonlinguistic performance.
The role of experience

Although it may be less obvious than in language tasks, nonlinguistic tasks also
may be affected by experience and acquired knowledge. RT even in very simple
visual search tasks is affected by practice and by familiarity of target and distracter
stimuli (Mruczek & Sheinberg, 2005). RT in complex visuospatial tasks such as
mental rotation also may be influenced by experiential variables including acquired knowledge, practice, strategy use, and/or linguistic mediation in addition to

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2

240

underlying cognitive function (Birren & Fisher, 1995; Salthouse, 1993). Similarly,
RT in difficult arithmetic problems may rely as much on acquired phonology and
mathematical knowledge and practice as it does on underlying representational or
efficiency constraints.
Another type of experiential difference in nonlinguistic performance could be
introduced through the process of bilingual or monolingual language learning. Using an executive function framework, Bialystok (1999) and Bialystok and Martin
(2004) have proposed that learning more than one language may enhance typically
developing children's ability to control selective attention to specific aspects of
mental representations. That is, bilingual and monolingual children may have
equal ability to analyze the structure of a mental representation or problem. However, as an outcome of dealing with the demands of selective attention in bilingual
language learning, bilingual children may have an advantage in nonlinguistic tasks
that require inhibition of distracting or conflicting information. There is a need for
more research in this area. If it is the case that there are replicable differences in
bilingual and monolingual information processing, this presents another aspect of
nonequivalence in the sensitivity and specificity of nonlinguistic tasks to inform
the LI profile across diverse populations.
The role of perceptual-motor speed

There is a perceptual-motor component in nonlinguistic tasks in which RT is
the dependent variable. Although perceptually encoding a stimulus and making a
decision may overlap in time, the motor response typically is seen as adding an
independent time component (Bates & Eysenck, 1993). If LI reflects neuromaturational delay (Bishop & Edmundson, 1987; Hill, 2001) then children with LI may
best be identified on nonlinguistic tasks that emphasize motor RT versus higher
level cognitive function. The LI literature is replete with findings that children
with LI are slower than typical monolingual peers on nonlinguistic tasks that emphasize motor speed, such as auditory and visual detection tasks (Ellis Weismer &
Hesketh, 1996; Lahey & Edwards, 1996, Montgomery & Leonard, 1998). LI
groups also show deficits in fine and gross motor tasks, such as peg moving, bead
threading, ball rolling, and tapping (Bishop, 1990; Bishop & Edmundson, 1987;
Miller et al., 2001; Powell & Bishop, 1992; see Hill, 2001, for a review). Also,
children with LI have been found to perform equivalently on perceptual-motor
tasks to children with Developmental Coordination Disorder, a diagnostic category
identifying children who are delayed in reaching motor milestones (Hill & Bishop,
1998; Kaplan, Dewey, Crawford, & Wilson, 2001).
The broader issue is that different theoretical perspectives of LI may predict
different nonlinguistic profiles in LI. For instance, if constrained neural processing
speed for elementary cognitive operations is implicated in LI (Kail, 1994; Miller
et al., 2001), then RT in a choice detection task (e.g., identifying one of two tones)
should be somewhat more sensitive to the LI profile than RT in an otherwise
equivalent, simple detection task (e.g., responding to the presence of a single
tone). That is, the small decision-making component in the choice detection task
should reflect the underlying neural speed of the mental operation more directly
than a simple detection task, in which a greater proportion of RT reflects the

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2
Windsor et al.: Nonlinguistic performance in language impairment

241

time to make a motor response rather than decision time (Bates & Stough, 1998).
As a different example, if LI primarily is due to short-term or working memory
constraints (Hoffman & Gillam, 2004; Montgomery, 2000), then the RT from tasks
that emphasize a memory component or are particularly demanding of resources
might be expected to be most sensitive to the LI profile. However, nonlinguistic
task performance in LI has not yet been studied in a way that allows for reliable
separation of one type of nonlinguistic task from another.
The role of task difficulty

Another factor to consider is that, as in language, not all nonlinguistic tasks are
implemented in ways that present the same degree of difficulty. It may be that
only complex nonlinguistic tasks or tasks that are demanding in a specific way
are reliably sensitive to the LI profile. Task difficulty has theoretical as well
as methodological implications. For example, in a limited processing capacity
view of LI it has been argued that children with LI will show disproportionate
decrements in performance relative to typical monolingual peers as task difficulty
increases. This argument has been used to explain disproportionate LI performance
decrements for unfamiliar versus familiar words, low versus high phonetic substance inflectional morphemes, and less versus more phonologically transparent
derivatives (Dollaghan, 1998; Montgomery & Leonard, 1998; Windsor & Hwang,
1999). However, these interpretations often have relied on comparison of slopes
across two conditions that present very different levels of task difficulty. In this
situation, larger LI performance decrements in absolute terms may mask the reality
of equivalent proportional decreases across groups.
When we have examined RT in graded levels of within-task difficulty, monolingual LI performance has not been affected disproportionately relative to typical
monolingual peers in auditory or visual detection, auditory serial memory, word
recognition, or picture naming (Kohnert & Windsor, 2004; Kohnert, Windsor, &
Miller, 2004; Windsor & Kohnert, 2004; Windsor & Kohnert, in press). Kohnert
et al. (2006) did, however, find a disproportionate LI decline with increased syllable
length in nonword repetition. This previous work also has shown a qualitatively
similar RT response to within-task difficulty for typical monolingual and bilingual
children in nonlinguistic tasks.
The role of development

A final factor to consider is how nonlinguistic performance might change with
age and be more or less sensitive to LI at different points in time. Monolingual
children's RT on many nonlinguistic tasks is influenced heavily by age (which
may reflect both development and experience). RT varies substantially during
childhood (Cerella & Hale, 1994; Kail, 1988, 1993; Kail & Salthouse, 1994).
Examining RT at more than one point in time is also important for building a
developmental trajectory for LI nonlinguistic performance. Karmiloff-Smith and
colleagues (Karmiloff-Smith, 2007; Karmiloff-Smith et al., 2004) have argued that
task-specific trajectories are critical to inform the nature of delayed or different
cognitive processes over time. That is, even though LI groups may show equivalent

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2
Windsor et al.: Nonlinguistic performance in language impairment

242

behavior to groups without LI at any given time point, this type of comparison
masks the possibility of different developmental routes. Nonlinguistic RT appears
to decrease at an exponential rate during childhood and adolescence for typically
developing monolingual children (Kail, 1991b, 1993). However, there is minimal
data about task-specific RT changes over time for children with LI. One longitudinal study suggests that nonlinguistic RT deficits are a stable characteristic
of LI across development. Miller et al. (2006) found that the nonlinguistic RT
of 9-year-olds with LI was moderately correlated with RT on the same tasks at
14 years of age.
NONLINGUISTIC TASKS OF INTEREST

The current study explores nonlinguistic performance across a range of tasks that
were administered in a systematic, replicable way with the same children, in order
to lay the framework for more focused examination of critical aspects of the
LI phenotype. The participants were school-age English-only speaking children
with or without LI as well as typically developing, sequential bilingual Spanish-
English speakers. It currently is much easier to validly rule out, rather than rule in,
a diagnosis of LI in bilingual children using conventional language assessments.
That is, we can be much surer in determination of typical development for bilingual
children than in determining LI. Thus, to be conservative in interpretation of
results, we did not include a group of bilingual children with LI.
We examined performance on seven nonlinguistic tasks. All tasks were within
the visual modality, had systematic levels of within-task difficulty, and were administered in parallel ways. However, the tasks ranged from very elementary
cognitive tasks to tasks that invoked higher level cognitive abilities. The tasks
included odd man out; two memory tasks, pattern matching and serial memory;
number search; simple arithmetic; and two complex visual-spatial processing
tasks: mental rotation and form completion. Most research to date on these tasks
has focused on monolingual children with and without LI, with less research on
typically developing sequential bilingual children's performance. An overview of
the tasks is given below.
The task expected to be the simplest (with the highest accuracy and shortest
RT) was odd man out. In a typical odd man out task, participants see three target
stimuli spaced at different distances. The two stimuli that are closest together are
considered a pair, and participants identify the third stimulus as the odd man out.
The task is an elementary cognitive task that is more complex than visual detection
tasks but which does not invoke higher level, symbolic processing (Burns &
Nettelbeck, 2003; Frearson & Eysenck, 1986), and it appears to be a stronger
correlate of IQ than other elementary choice RT tasks (Diascro & Brody, 1984).
Although no odd man out tasks have been used previously with children labeled
as LI, this task has been used to identify speed differences between other child
groups. Kranzler (1994) found that children with reading disabilities were slower
on an odd man out task than age peers, although there was no group difference
when the groups were equated for IQ. Kranzler, Whang, and Jensen (1994) found
that gifted high school children had a faster RT than academically average age
peers on the task.

Visual memory tasks may take several forms. The first memory task of interest
was a pattern-matching task with different delay intervals between array presentations. The second memory task was a serial memory task in which patterns of
lights were recalled. Each task relies on visual perceptual skill and the ability to
maintain visual information in short-term memory. Although no RT studies appear
to have examined visual memory in LI, aspects of visual perception and memory
have been addressed. Children with LI have been found to be less accurate than
age peers in making same/different judgments about the length of vertical lines
and about the serial order of unfamiliar face and scribble pattern arrays displayed
for a short time (Fazio, 1998; Powell & Bishop, 1992). Lower LI accuracy also
has been shown in recalling the serial order of visually presented digits, especially
when the children used a pointing (vs. speaking) response to identify serial order
(Gillam, Cowan, & Marler, 1998). Finally, Hick, Botting, and Conti-Ramsden
(2005) found that, unlike typical age peers, the accuracy of young children with
LI for a visual pattern recall task did not increase over a 1-year period.
In the fourth task, number search, participants identify a target number from a
number array. In some simple visual search tasks (e.g., detecting a target red circle
in a row of green circles), parallel processing of the full array may be sufficient
to be successful in the task. However, because numeric characters can look quite
similar, number search emphasizes a slower serial search mechanism of focal
attention to each number in the array until the target number is found (Chelazzi,
1999). If the task invokes slower, serial search, it would be expected that there
would be a longer RT to detect target numbers that are systematically closer to
the end of the array. Miller et al. (2001) examined visual search using target
nonsense figures. Children with LI were as accurate as their age peers but tended
to be slower.
In the fifth task, simple arithmetic problems are presented visually. Task completion relies partly on visual-spatial processing and abstract, magnitude representation. Arithmetic also includes a phonological component, with numbers
being manipulated in a way that they are not in a number search task (Dehaene,
1992; Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu, & Tsivkin, 1999). The arithmetic task
arguably has the highest linguistic component of the seven tasks examined here.
To the extent that knowledge in the target language is involved, both monolingual
children with LI and typical bilingual children might perform with slower speed
than typical monolingual children on mathematical tasks. Young monolingual
children with LI have been found to be less accurate than age peers in oral counting tasks and nonoral numerosity tasks, such as matching or changing quantity
(Arvedson, 2002; Fazio, 1994). Difficulty with arithmetic facts and problems may
persist through the school years, although deficits may not be seen in skills that
do not rely on linguistic mediation, such as judging the relative size of single
and double digit symbols (Cowan, Donlan, Newton, & Lloyd, 2005; Donlan &
Gourlay, 1999; Fazio, 1996, 1999). Although magnitude representation may not be
affected by monolingual or bilingual language learning (Bialystok & Majumder,
1998), typical bilingual children have been found to show better performance
for verbal mathematical problems presented in the first versus second language
(Bernardo, 2002). Even in adulthood, speed and accuracy of mental arithmetic
may be subject to interference from the first language (Magiste, 1980). However,

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2
Windsor et al.: Nonlinguistic performance in language impairment

244

these effects may be subtle if a verbal response is not required (Geary, Cormier,
Goggin, Estrada, & Lunn, 1993).
The tasks expected to be the most cognitively demanding were two complex
visual-spatial processing tasks involving mental imagery and abstract problem
solving, mental rotation, and a form completion task. Neither task has a heavy
memory load because the visual stimuli are present throughout each task. Mental
rotation, involving visual-spatial representation and the ability to mentally "move"
those representations, is a cognitive skill that develops gradually. In a typical mental rotation task, participants see two shapes and make a same/different judgment.
One member of the shape pair is rotated at various angles, so successful task
completion depends on the ability to recognize shape identity despite the apparent
dissimilarity produced by rotation. For both adults and children about 8 years and
older (Courbois, 2000; Kail, 1991a), RT to recognize identical shapes tends to
increase linearly with angle of rotation. However, age and stimulus characteristics
play a significant role in task performance, with young children being poor at
rotating shapes without a salient axis and also poor at rotating shapes that have
identifiable components (that can be independently rotated). Thus, a linear trend
across rotation angle may not always be present in a given task (Courbois, 2000;
Rosser, 1994; Takano, 1989).
Participants in the mental rotation study noted earlier by Johnston and Ellis
Weismer (1983) were first and third graders who rotated geometric forms; children
with LI were slower than age peers to complete the task. Miller et al. (2001) found
that third graders with LI (an average of 9 years of age) were less accurate and
slower in mental rotation of nonsense figures than age peers. McLeay (2003) found
that proficient Welsh-English-speaking adults were quicker than their monolingual
English-speaking peers to complete a type of mental rotation task using images of
knotted and unknotted ropes. Group differences emerged only for complex stimuli
(i.e., ropes with five or six knots). Following Bialystok (1999), the results were
interpreted as proficient bilingual language processing leading to greater efficiency
in attentional control and nonlinguistic problem solving.
The other spatial task, form completion, was adapted from the Revised
Minnesota Paper Form Board Test (MPFBT; Likert & Quahsa, 1970), and involved mental assembly of several smaller geometric forms into one larger form.
Children with LI have been found to be less accurate than age peers on this
task (Kamhi, Catts, Mauer, Apel, & Gentry, 1988; Savich, 1984). For example,
Kamhi et al. (1988) found that 6- to 9-year-old children with LI or a reading impairment made more errors than age peers on MPFBT items. Bialystok
and Majumder (1998) found that bilingual children who were equally proficient
in French and English were more accurate in pattern analysis (a block design
task) than both monolingual English-speaking children and "partially" bilingual
Bengali-English-speaking children who showed greater proficiency in English.
The proficient bilingual children also tended to be more accurate than the other
two groups in a horizontal coordinate task (drawing a water line).
STUDY PREDICTIONS

We made four predictions about the possible roles of group differences, perceptual-
motor ability, task difficulty, and chronological age in nonlinguistic performance.

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2
Windsor et al.: Nonlinguistic performance in language impairment

245

All predictions were motivated by the empirical literature rather than being framed
in any one particular theory of LI. First, given the wide array of nonlinguistic
tasks on which children with LI have been found to show deficits, we made the
broad prediction that nonlinguistic performance in general is a reliable part of
the LI phenotype. We also assumed that the nonlinguistic tasks would be free of
language-specific experiences, and thus, that the typical bilingual and monolingual
children would perform equivalently across tasks. However, group differences
could be present in tasks that are linguistically mediated and/or have a visual-
spatial problem-solving component, such as arithmetic, mental rotation, and form
completion. The seven tasks were not designed to manipulate selective attention,
and we were less able to address the issue raised by Bialystok (1999) of a potential
bilingual advantage in tasks requiring inhibition of information.
The second prediction was that perceptual-motor RT would explain some but
not all of the variance in higher level tasks. That is, we expected the slower
RT of the LI group would reflect higher level cognitive operations as well as a
perceptual-motor deficit. Lahey and Edwards (1996) found that detection RT (an
auditory-visual task composite) contributed about one-third of the variance in
picture naming RT for 4- to 9-year-old monolingual children with and without
LI. Children with LI also were slower than age peers in another simple auditory
detection task; however, this difference was insufficient to explain slower LI RT
in a lexical decision task. Kohnert et al. (2004) found that group differences in a
choice visual detection task were not sufficient to explain LI slower RT in a word
recognition task relative to age peers.
Given our earlier findings of no qualitative group differences in response to
within-task difficulty, the third prediction was that we would replicate this result. Given the very small research base with bilingual children, we made the
parsimonious assumption that bilingual children would show the same patterns
as monolingual children. In the absence of information about a developmental
trajectory of nonlinguistic performance in LI, the fourth prediction was that RT
would decrease with age but that group patterns of performance would be similar
at different age points on each task. Although Miller et al.'s (2006) finding that
children's RT at one age predicted RT 5 years later does not speak to the course
of development per se, these findings do suggest the persistency of nonlinguistic
deficits in LI.

METHOD

Participants

One hundred 8- to 13-year-old children took part in the study, recruited mainly
through advertisements in local newspapers (see also Windsor & Kohnert, 2004).
Twenty-eight children (16 boys, 12 girls) were monolingual English speakers with
a primary LI (LI group), 50 children (22 boys, 28 girls) were typical monolingual
English speakers (EO group), and 22 children (13 boys, 9 girls) were typical
sequential bilingual Spanish-English speakers (BI group). Average age of the
LI group (M = 10 years, 6 months [10;6], SD = 1;7) and the EO group (M =
10;7, SD = 1;10) was equivalent; the BI group was about 9 months younger
(M = 9;9, SD = 1;5). All children passed screening tests of hearing (acuity),

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2

246

vision (color and acuity), and oral-motor skills; and no child had a history of
neurological or socioemotional concerns. Most children preferred to use the right
hand (Oldfield, 1971), and the proportion of right-hand preference was equivalent
across groups. About 70% of children in the LI group and all children in the
EO group were Caucasian. All children in the BI group were Hispanic/Latino.
Children tended to be from middle-income homes. However, some children in
the EO group came from higher income backgrounds than children in the other
groups. On the Hollingshead (1975) 5-point scale (1 = higher socioeconomic
status), the EO group obtained a mean rating of 2.00 (SD = 0.97). The LI
and BI groups obtained means of 2.39 (SD = 0.83) and 3.27 (SD = 1.08),
respectively.
The LI group met conventional criteria for specific LI. Each child had a listening
and/or speaking standard score on the English version of the Clinical Evaluation
of Language Fundamentals--Third Edition (CELF-E; Semel, Wiig, & Secord,
1995) that was greater than 1 SD below the mean. Thirteen children had a mixed
expressive-receptive impairment, with both listening and speaking standard scores
below 85. Nine children had an expressive-only impairment and 6 had a receptiveonly impairment. All but 2 of the 28 children had a history of receiving special
services. Each child in the LI group had a standard score of 85 or above on the Test
of Nonverbal Intelligence--Third Edition (TONI; Brown, Sherbenou, & Johnsen,
1997). Each child in the EO group had CELF-E and TONI scores that were no
greater than 1 SD below the mean.
The BI children all learned Spanish as a first or primary language and attended
English-only educational programs. Parents were interviewed about their children's pattern of language use in Spanish and English. Children were reported to
have 4-8 years of consistent English experience. All BI children were performing
at or above grade level in the mainstream English educational environment, and
could participate fully in the experimental tasks administered in English. Alongside
this overall reported English competency, children continued to use Spanish as the
primary language when interacting with parents in the home setting. Independent
validation of abilities in each language was obtained using Spanish (Semel, Wiig, &
Secord, 1997), and English versions of the CELF, administered in counterbalanced
order across children. Each child in the BI group had a standard score of 85 or
above on both test versions. Because parent report has not always been found to be
an accurate indicator of language ability in bilingual Spanish-English school-age
children, independent measures of ability in each language were considered most
appropriate (cf. Goldstein, Fabiano, & Washington, 2005). Standard test scores
for each of the three groups are shown in Table 1.

General procedures

Half of the children in each group first took part in odd man out followed in order
by pattern matching, form completion, arithmetic, mental rotation, serial memory,
and number search. The other half of the children took part in mental rotation
followed by serial memory, number search, arithmetic, form completion, pattern
matching, and odd man out. The two task orders were selected randomly and
tasks were administered over two 1.5-hr sessions. All tasks were implemented

as choice RT tasks using E-Prime software. In six tasks, children used the index
finger of the preferred hand to press one of two response buttons as quickly as
possible to indicate a decision, moving the finger from a home position to make
a response for each trial. Children used a computer mouse to respond in serial
memory. Children received standard task instructions, and took part in training
and practice trials prior to experimental trials. During eight training trials in each
task, children were given feedback about response accuracy and speed and about
consistent finger placement on the response buttons. In practice, children saw
another eight trials without feedback, and were required to achieve a minimum of
six accurate responses before proceeding to the experimental trials. Children who
did not meet this criterion repeated the training and practice. Each task included
four levels of task difficulty, with trials presented randomly. As a measure of
perceptual-motor RT in an elementary visual task, data from the same children
on a choice visual detection task (Kohnert & Windsor, 2004) was used. This task
matched the format of the other tasks in that children used the index finger to press
one of two response buttons as quickly as possible. Stimuli and procedures for
each experimental task and the choice visual detection task are described below.
Example stimuli are shown in Figure 1.
Odd man out. Eleven circles with a diameter of 25 ms were presented equally

spaced in a semicircular array on a computer screen. Three circles were yellow
target circles; the others were green nontarget circles. Target circles were identified
uniquely; one had an outer blue ring, another had a red ring, and the third had
no outer ring. Target circles were arranged so that either the blue- or red-ringed
circle was "paired" with the third yellow circle in the sense that it was closer to
this circle (Figure 1a). Children identified the other circle as the "odd man out."
There were 48 unique trials (12 trials in each of four levels of task difficulty), with
5 trials repeated for the purpose of checking response reliability. Task difficulty

was manipulated by varying the distance between the paired circles relative to the
distance between the pair and odd man out. Pilot testing indicted that the easiest
level, Level 1, was when the distance between the paired circles and odd man
out followed a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio (i.e., there was one nontarget circle between the

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2

249

paired circles and either three or four nontarget circles separating the odd man
out). In Level 2, the paired circles were positioned adjacent to each other, with
the odd man out being in any of the other nonadjacent positions. In Level 3 there
was either a 1:2 or 2:4 distance ratio. At the hardest level, Level 4, the distance
between the paired circles and odd man out was close, with a 2:3 or 3:4 ratio.
Children identified the odd man out by pressing response buttons marked by blue
and red dots. RT for accurate responses was measured from trial onset.
Pattern matching. As shown in Figure 1b, children saw a target five-shape array

on a computer screen. This was followed by an identical or very similar five-shape
array at a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-s interval (Levels 1-4). Shape arrays differed in the
shapes, colors, orientations, and/or interior details used. For example, one target
shape array consisted of a row of five different colored stars placed diagonally
across the computer screen. Another target array consisted of five hexagons placed
in two horizontal rows. The first array in each presentation pair appeared for
3 s; the second array remained in place until children pressed a response button.
There were 100 pairs of stimulus presentations, with 25 pairs at each difficulty
level (13 same, 12 different). Ten pairs (6 same, 4 different) were repeated for
checking reliability. Children pressed response buttons labeled same/different to
make a judgment about whether the two arrays were identical. RT for accurate
responses was measured from the onset of the second array in the pair.
Serial memory. Five equidistant, three-dimensional, colored circles were created

using Adobe software and presented on a computer screen. Four of the circles
appeared as the corner of a square, with the fifth circle placed in the center (Figure 1c). Children saw the circles illuminate in a given sequence, with each circle illuminating for 300 ms followed immediately by another circle illuminating. There
were 80 sequences, increasing from sequences of two to five circles (Levels 1-4,
with 20 sequences at each level). Eight sequences were repeated for reliability
checking. A 150-ms, 1000-Hz tone indicated the end of each sequence. Children
responded by clicking the computer mouse on each circle to replicate the sequence
as quickly as possible after the tone. To show that the children had used the mouse
accurately, the circle illuminated for 150 ms when the mouse was clicked on
any circle. Of interest was total RT to complete each sequence. RT for accurate
responses was measured from the end of the 1000-Hz tone with the 150-ms
illumination periods subtracted.
Number search. Children responded to the presence/absence of a target number

in a serial array of 19 numbers (Figure 1d). The target number appeared on the
left side of a computer screen and remained visible throughout each trial. In 100
experimental trials the target number also appeared in one of four equally spaced
positions in the number array, in the 2nd, 7th, 12th, or 18th position (Levels 1-4).
The target number appeared in each of the four positions in 25 trials, and was
absent from the array in 50 other trials. Ten trials in which the target number was
present were repeated for the purpose of checking response reliability. Children
were instructed to search for the target number by scanning from left to right. Only
numbers between 10 and 19 were used in the task to keep the visual similarity

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2
Windsor et al.: Nonlinguistic performance in language impairment

250

of numbers constant across and within trials, and to encourage serial scanning.
Thus, numbers (except the target number) could be repeated in the array. Children
pressed response buttons labeled yes/no to indicate the presence/absence of the
target number. RT for accurate responses was measured from trial onset.
Arithmetic. A series of simple addition problems with correct or incorrect answers

were presented vertically in large black font on a white computer screen (Figure 1e). There were 100 trials, with 25 addition problems at each of four levels
(13 correct and 12 incorrect answers). Levels 1-4 were represented by problems
involving the addition of two to five digits (using 0-9). Ten trials (five correct)
were repeated for the purpose of reliability checking. Children pressed response
buttons labeled yes/no to indicate the correctness of the addition problems. RT for
accurate responses was measured from trial onset.
Mental rotation. Shape pairs were presented on a computer screen, with the
target shape on the left side of the screen and the other shape on the right side
(Figure 1f). Ten black-and-white, straight-edged, nonsymmetrical polygons were
created using Adobe software. Each polygon was created from a 7.5-cm square
and contained six or seven angles. To make the task easier, a salient feature (e.g., a
distinct projection) was identifiable in each shape. Eight other stimuli were created
from each of the 10 target shapes. These included the target shape at 45 , 90 ,
135 , and 180 rotation and the mirror images of the target shape at the same
four angles of rotation. Thus, each target shape was paired with the same shape at
one of the four angles of rotation in 40 trials and paired with a different, mirror
image at one of the four angles of rotation in 40 trials. The 80 stimulus trials
were presented randomly. Task difficulty (Levels 1-4) was determined by rotation
angle of the second shape (45 , 90 , 135 , and 180 ), with 10 "same" and 10
"different" trials at each of the four levels. Eight trials (four same, four different)
were repeated to check reliability. Pilot work showed that the conventional format
with simultaneous shape presentations resulted in very low accuracy. Accuracy
was improved by presenting the target shape in isolation and then presenting the
second shape (via an examiner mouse click) when a child said he/she was "ready."
This procedure was used in the experimental task. Children pressed response
buttons labeled same/different to make a decision. RT for accurate responses was
measured from presentation of the second shape.
Form completion. Children were presented with geometric form stimuli from the

MPFBT and chose the correct form assembly from one of two choices labeled A
and B (Figure 1g). Forty MPFBT items were used, divided into four levels with 10
items. There were two forms to be assembled in items at Level 1, three forms at
Level 2, four forms at Level 3, and five forms at Level 4. Four items (one from each
level) were repeated to check reliability. Stimuli were presented in a small booklet,
with one item per page, with the unassembled pieces at the top of a page and the
two options of assembled forms at the page bottom. To obtain the RT measure, the
examiner pressed a computer key simultaneously with presentation of each page.
Children pressed one of two response buttons to indicate the choice for each item.
RT for accurate responses was measured from the examiner's computer key press.

Choice visual detection. The procedure and results for this task are described by

Kohnert and Windsor (2004). The task was administered in random order to the
children in the midst of the other seven tasks. Children indicated the presence of a
blue or red circle presented on a computer screen by pressing one of two response
buttons. RT for accurate responses was measured from stimulus onset. Children
responded in four blocked conditions, each with 25 trials. There were four blocked
response levels (pressing a response button with the preferred and nonpreferred
hand, pressing a foot pedal with the preferred and nonpreferred foot). All children
had at least 95% task accuracy, and chronological age accounted for about 40%
of the variance in overall detection task RT. RT from only the simplest level was
used here, that is, using the index finger of the preferred hand. Mean RT at this
level was 678 ms (SD = 181 ms) for the EO group, 745 ms (SD = 219 ms) for the
LI group, and 683 ms (SD = 135 ms) for the BI group.
Analyses

Task accuracy was determined from trials with "same" pairs in pattern matching
and mental rotation, from trials in which the target number was present in number
search, and from trials with correct additions in arithmetic. All trials were analyzed
in odd man out, serial memory, form completion, and choice visual detection. RT
was obtained from accurate responses in each task. RT outliers, defined as 2 SD
from the mean task RT for an individual child, were excluded. There were some
far-outlying RT values in serial memory and mental rotation, and responses above
8 s were excluded from these tasks before trimming 2 SD. These procedures
resulted in eliminating 5.0% of the data in odd man out, 5.4% in pattern matching,
3.9% in serial memory, 4.1% in number search, 4.6% in arithmetic, 5.5% in form
completion, and 9.9% in mental rotation (reflecting the number of outlying values
in this task). An equivalent proportion of responses was excluded from each group
in each task.
There were four sets of analyses. The first set of accuracy and RT analyses
explored differences in groups and difficulty levels in each task using an analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA; age as the covariate). Significant main and interaction
effects were examined with Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons. The second analysis examined interrelationships among tasks and the role of motor RT
from choice visual detection as a predictor of RT performance in the other tasks.
Because the easiest task level has the highest accuracy and also arguably minimizes
the effect of experience, it provides the least biased RT comparison among groups.
Thus, RT at Level 1 was of interest for this analysis. Pearson correlations were
used to identify task associations, again with Bonferroni adjustment. Even though
it might obscure group differences in patterns of association, all 100 children
were included in this analysis because of the large number of variables (i.e., the
smaller sample sizes in the LI and BI groups would lead to unreliable correlation
estimates). Regression analyses were used to determine the contribution of motor
speed to performance on other tasks. Separate regression analyses for each group
were used here because of the smaller number of predictors. The fourth analysis
provides a trajectory of individuals' mean RT at Level 1 in each task across ages.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify task differences at younger
versus older ages for each group.

RESULTS

Response reliability

Each of the three groups of children showed response reliability above 80% in
five of the seven tasks, with a mean reliability across groups of 84.9% in odd man
out, 81.3% in pattern matching, 82.9% in number search, 87.7% in arithmetic,
and 80.5% in mental rotation. Reliability was lower in form completion (77.6%)
and lower still in serial memory (71.1%). Reliability was equivalent across groups
except for serial memory. Here, LI group reliability was at 63.4% compared to
the BI group (73.8%) and the EO group (76.0%). Because reliability trials came
from the more as well as less difficult levels in each task, these reliability values
were not unexpected. Higher reliability also may have been constrained by the
relatively small number of reliability items (e.g., with only four trials repeated
in form completion). As shown below, reliability was lowest in the three tasks in
which there was the lowest group accuracy overall.
Accuracy across groups and levels of task difficulty

Figure 2 shows group accuracy (age adjusted) in each of the seven tasks. Because
our emphasis was on RT, the tasks were designed to be performed with high
accuracy by all groups. The Level 1 results confirmed that this was so when the
tasks were easy. The EO group showed at or above 90% accuracy at Level 1
in all tasks and the BI group did so in all tasks except in mental rotation and
form completion; accuracy was at or above 85% in these two tasks. The LI group
performed at 90% or above at Level 1 in all tasks except serial memory, where
accuracy was marginally lower than in mental rotation, where accuracy was at
80%.
The LI group's lower Level 1 accuracy in serial memory and mental rotation
remained when overall accuracy was examined. Separate two-way ANCOVAs
(Group x Level) indicated no significant group differences in odd man out (Figure 2a), pattern matching (Figure 2b), number search (Figure 2d), arithmetic (Figure 2e), or form completion (Figure 2g). However, the LI group had significantly
lower accuracy than both the BI and EO groups in mental rotation (Figure 1f ),
F (2, 96) = 12.29, p < .0001, f = .25. LI group accuracy also was significantly
lower than the EO group in serial memory (Figure 2c); BI accuracy fell between
the EO and LI groups on this task, F (2, 96) = 4.11, p = .02, f = .32.

Figure 2. Mean accuracy (adjusted for age) across groups and tasks. (a-g) For Levels 1-4,
odd man out levels are (1:3 or 1:4), (adjacent), (1:2 or 2:4), and (2:3 or 3:4) distance ratios.
Pattern matching levels are "same" arrays at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-s delay intervals. Serial memory
levels are two-, three-, four, and five-tone presentations. Number search levels reflect the target
number in the 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 18th serial positions. Arithmetic levels are two-, three-, four-,
and five-digit additions. Mental rotation levels are "same" items at 45 , 90 , 135 , and 180
rotation angles; form completion levels are two, three, four, and five forms to be assembled. [A

Group accuracy declined in five of the seven tasks as difficulty level increased.
There were significant effects of task level for pattern matching, F (3, 288) =
2.91, p = .03, f = .13; serial memory, F (3, 288) = 10.18, p < .0001, f = .72;
number search, F (3, 288) = 38.60, p < .0001, f = .29; arithmetic, F (3, 288) =
4.74, p = .003, f = .72; and form completion, F (3, 288) = 4.32, p = .005, f =
.63. Accuracy was close to ceiling level in odd man out, precluding robust level
effects. There was no significant decline in accuracy as angle of rotation increased
in mental rotation. There was no significant Group x Level interaction effect in
any ANCOVA except for form completion. The overall group difference and large
effect size in this task was driven by the lower LI accuracy compared to the other
two groups at Level 4, F (6, 288) = 4.84, p = .004.
RT across groups and levels of task difficulty

Figure 3 shows groups' mean RT (age adjusted) for each level in each task.
Although age adjusting was appropriate because of the broad age range, age and
motor RT were expected to be correlated. That is, removing the variance for age
in an ANCOVA also removed at least some of the variance due to motor RT.
The group differences in Figure 3 should be considered with this in mind. The
LI group was observably slower than the other groups in arithmetic and mental
rotation, with the two typical groups showing overlapping performance (Figure 3e
and f). There were three tasks in which the LI group also was observably slower
than the EO group, but with the BI group falling between the other two groups.
These three tasks were odd man out (Figure 3a), pattern matching (Figure 3b),
and form completion (Figure 3g). Although there were no large differences in the
other two tasks, serial memory (Figure 3c) and number search (Figure 3d), the BI
group tended to be faster than both monolingual groups.
Two-way ANCOVAs for each task were used to analyze the effects of group
and task level. As expected from visual inspection, statistically significant group
differences were found in five tasks: odd man out, F (2, 96) = 4.15, p = .02, f =
.23; pattern matching, F (2, 96) = 6.12, p = .003, f = .10; arithmetic, F (2, 96) =
2.94, p = .05, f = .13; mental rotation, F (2, 96) = 3.33, p = .04, f = .22; and
form completion, F (2, 96) = 5.05, p = .03, f = .14. In each instance, the LI group
had a significantly longer RT than the EO group. In addition, as was expected,
there was no significant difference between EO and BI RT; however, there also
was no significant difference between LI and BI RT. The EO and BI groups had
an essentially equal mean RT in arithmetic and mental rotation (and indeed the
BI group had a slightly faster mean RT than the EO group in arithmetic); and the

Figure 3. Mean response time (RT, adjusted for age) across groups and tasks. For serial
memory, the increasing RT across levels is an artifact because the RT is directly affected by
the length of the tone sequences in this task. In the case of mental rotation, the English-only
(EO) group spent a shorter mean time looking at the first shape before seeing the second shape
appear (1784 ms); however, this RT was not significantly different from that of the language
impairment (LI) group (2007 ms) or bilingual (BI) group (2027 ms). [A color version of this

nonsignificant BI-LI group difference in these two tasks most likely reflects the
greater variability in the BI group at Level 4 (Figure 3e and f).
Significant and robust main effects of difficulty level were found in four of the
six tasks where this was relevant: odd man out, F (3, 288) = 10.47, p < .0001,
f = .14; number search, F (3, 288) = 34.94, p < .0001, f = .18; and arithmetic,
F (3, 288) = 57.09, p < .0001, f = .72. For pattern matching, there was a Group x
Level interaction effect, with only the LI and BI groups showing an increasing RT
with difficulty level, F (6, 288) = 2.90, p = .009. Although there was a tendency
for RT to increase across levels (Figure 3f and g), there were no significant level
effects in the two complex spatial tasks, mental rotation or form completion, and
no other Group x Level interaction effect. (Note that the RT increase for serial
memory is artificial because RT reflects the length of the total sequence, with the
longest sequence at Level 4.)
Contribution of perceptual-motor speed to task RT

Table 2 shows the correlations among age and task RT, using each child's mean
RT at Level 1 for each task, including choice visual detection. There were robust
and largely significant correlations among tasks. The one outlier is the correlation
between number search and mental rotation in which the LI group showed a
different pattern to the EO and BI groups (see Table 2). As expected across this
age range, choice visual detection and age were significantly correlated (r =
.50). Each contributed to task RT. The effect of removing both chronological age
and choice visual detection RT is shown in the partial correlation matrix. Robust
intercorrelations among tasks remained after accounting for these shared contributions, although the strength of association was lower. The highest correlation was
for arithmetic and number search (r = .54) followed by mental rotation and form
completion (r = .47), odd man out and form completion (r = .44), arithmetic and
odd man out (r = .40), arithmetic and form completion (r = .37), and arithmetic
and mental rotation (r = .35).
Stepwise regression analyses for each group were used to analyze the
contribution of choice visual detection beyond that of age to RT in the tasks. To
be conservative, age always was entered first even when choice visual detection
was the stronger predictor. The results are shown in Table 3, with what appears
to be the least reliable results for the smallest BI group. For the EO group
(N = 50) 47-62% of the RT variance in five tasks could be explained by age and
choice visual detection RT. A lower proportion of variance could be attributed to
these two predictors in the two longer tasks, mental rotation and form completion
(17%). Lower proportions of variance were captured in each task in the LI group,
but this could well reflect the smaller sample size. However, relative to the EO
group, a much smaller proportion of variance, only 6%, could be attributed to age
and choice visual detection RT for serial memory. For the small BI group (N =
22), no significant variance was captured by the two variables, except in pattern
matching, number search, and arithmetic, where age contributed significantly to
the variance. CELF-E (for the EO and LI groups) and CELF-S (for the BI group)
was entered as a predictor after age and choice visual detection to explore the
contribution of language ability. Table 3 shows that CELF score accounted for a
significant portion of additional variance in mental rotation for all three groups.

RT and development

oldest. The EO group showed a systematic decrease with age in RT and in withintask RT variability on the four shorter tasks: odd man out, pattern matching, serial
memory and number search. This was true also for arithmetic, but with more
variability at younger ages than in the other four tasks (Figure 4a). For the longer
visuospatial tasks, RT also appeared to decrease with age, but with high individual
variability in form completion and to a lesser extent in mental rotation (Figure
4b). The same general pattern held for the BI group (Figure 4c and d) and for the
LI group, although Figure 4e suggests a somewhat flatter RT slope across age for
this group, perhaps especially for serial memory. In the EO and BI groups, there
was marked variability in mental rotation and form completion (Figure 4f) and
some greater variability in arithmetic (Figure 4e).
To examine performance over time statistically, each group was divided in half
into younger and older subgroups. The younger EO subgroup had a mean age of
9;0 (SD = 0;10) and the older subgroup were about 3 years older at a mean age
of 12;2 (SD = 1;0). The younger and older LI subgroups were separated by about
2.5 years, with mean ages of 9;3 (SD = 0;11) and 11;8 (SD = 0;7), respectively.
The two BI subgroups were about 2 years apart, with mean ages of 8;8 (SD = 0;6)
and 10;11 (SD = 1;0). Separate two-way ANOVAs were used to analyze the effects
of age subgroup and task. The older EO subgroup had a significantly shorter RT
than the younger subgroup, F (1, 48) = 29.35, p < .001, d = .49, and arithmetic,
mental rotation, and form completion were longer than other tasks, F (6, 288) =
11.40, p = .001, f = .90. The Age x Task interaction was not significant. The LI
group also showed significant effects of age, F (1, 26) = 15.21, p = .001, d = .16,
and task, F (6, 162) = 7.03, p < .001, f = .32, with the same three tasks being
longer than the other tasks. The BI group also performed equivalently, with the
same significant effects of age, F (1, 20) = 17.99, p < .001, d = .48, and task,
F (6, 120) = 12.88, p < .001, f = .70. The Age x Task interaction effect also
was significant, F (6, 120) = 5.14, p = .001. This statistical effect is difficult to
identify unambiguously but appears to be because of the larger RT decrease with
age for form completion and arithmetic than for other tasks.

Summary

The LI group was less accurate in mental rotation than both typical groups and
also less accurate than the EO group in serial memory. Group accuracy declined
as task difficulty increased in all tasks except mental rotation (and odd man
out, in which there was ceiling performance). There was a qualitatively similar
accuracy profile across groups for all tasks except the most difficult task, form
completion. In this task, the LI group showed disproportionately lower accuracy
at the hardest task level. The LI group was observably slower than both typical
groups in mental rotation and arithmetic, and also slower than the EO group in
odd man out, pattern matching, and form completion. RT significantly increased
as task difficulty increased except in the two longest tasks, mental rotation and
form completion. There was a qualitatively similar RT profile across groups for
all tasks except pattern matching. Unlike the LI and BI groups, the EO group did
not show an RT increase with task difficulty here.

Significant correlations among tasks remained after accounting for age and
choice visual detection RT. Age and choice visual detection RT together contributed significantly to all tasks for the EO group, but with choice visual detection adding significant variance after age in only four tasks (odd man out, serial
memory, number search, and arithmetic). For the LI group additional significant
variance was contributed only in odd man out and number search. Although no
significant effects were found for the BI group, this likely reflects the relatively
small group size. RT trajectories across age showed an overall decline in RT
across tasks for each group, with marked RT variability in mental rotation and
form completion.
DISCUSSION

There are four main study results related to the predictions of nonlinguistic task
similarity in informing the LI phenotype, qualitative similarity across groups,
and the contributions of perceptual-motor speed and age. Each of these issues is
discussed below.
Group effects across tasks

The children with LI showed a slower RT (age adjusted) than typical monolingual
peers on many but not all tasks. When compared with typical sequential bilingual
peers, the LI group still tended to show a slower RT, but there were some differential task responses between monolingual and bilingual children that complicate
the interpretation of nonlinguistic visual task performance. When only the two
monolingual groups are considered, the LI group consistently was slower than the
EO group in all tasks except number search and serial memory, a task in which
the two group's RT was remarkably similar. Although there also was no difference
in number search accuracy, the LI group did show lower serial memory accuracy
than the EO group. Given Miller et al.'s (2001) finding that children with LI tended
to be slower than age peers in a visual search task using nonsense figures, it was
expected that we would find the same group difference in number search as in the
other tasks. It may be that the use of similar-looking digits rather than nonsense
figures introduces a different kind of scanning or search process.
One new contribution of this study is to compare LI visual task performance
with that of bilingual peers. The BI group was separated statistically from the
monolingual LI group in only two tasks, in mean accuracy and RT for mental
rotation and in mean RT for arithmetic. Although neither RT group difference
reached statistical significance, the equivalent mean EO and BI performances in
Figure 3e and f strongly suggest that this is an issue of statistical power associated
with ANCOVA. Task accuracy also may play a role in reliability of the RT results,
with the slightly lower accuracy at Level 4 in these tasks leaving a fairly small
number of trials on which to base the RT measures (Salthouse & Hedden, 2002).
Arguably, these two tasks are the most related to language ability, and the finding
that the LI group's performance should fall below that of the two typical groups
is not surprising from this perspective.

263

However, the BI group fell between the EO and LI groups in odd man out, pattern
matching, and form completion. Although we assume that different mechanisms
are at play in the BI and LI group's performances; we do not know why the BI
group was not significantly faster than the LI group in these three tasks or why the
BI group tended to be faster than the two monolingual groups in serial memory
and number search. It may simply be an issue of statistical power, with high
variability in the fairly small BI group. The nonlinguistic tasks were not designed
to manipulate Bialystok's (1999) notion of differential processing for analysis and
inhibition in problem solving tasks, and this may be a useful avenue to explore
with these tasks.
Response to task difficulty

A second contribution of the study is to show that typical monolingual and bilingual language learners and impaired monolingual language learners respond to
increasing nonlinguistic task difficulty in the same highly predictable way. Where
there were robust effects of task level in accuracy or RT, the performance of the
three groups was qualitatively similar. All groups had lower accuracy and/or a
slower RT as task difficulty increased. The two exceptions to this finding were that
LI accuracy was significantly lower than EO or BI accuracy in form completion
only at Level 4 and only the LI and BI groups showed an increasing RT with
difficulty level in pattern matching (although all three groups showed a decline in
accuracy). Even in mental rotation and form completion, where there is substantive
RT variability among younger and older children, all three groups show the same
type of variability on these tasks that they do not show on other tasks.
The overall qualitative equivalence in response to task difficulty, as well as the
general across-task equivalence with increasing age, supports the idea that language learning may be considered within one theoretical framework that addresses
differences introduced by both cognition and experience. Notably, for informationprocessing accounts of LI that highlight attention, speed, and/or memory efficiency
or capacity limitations (see Leonard, 1998, for an overview); these findings suggest
that the LI group did not disproportionately exceed those limitations relative to
typical peers. Even in the case of pattern matching, where the LI group RT did
increase in a disproportionate way to that of the EO group, the LI pattern closely
matches that of the typical BI group. It remains possible that qualitative group
differences emerge on tasks that are more difficult than those examined here.
Contribution of age and perceptual-motor RT

Children spanned a 6-year age range, and it was expected that age would play a
role in task performance. The contribution varied across tasks for the EO group,
with age accounting for only 14% of the variance in form completion and 56% in
number search. Perceptual-motor speed, as measured by choice visual detection
RT made a significant contribution beyond that of age in the EO group across
most tasks. The notable exceptions were the two longer visuospatial tasks, mental
rotation and form completion, as well as pattern matching. One limitation of
the choice visual detection measure is that we cannot isolate motor RT from

Applied Psycholinguistics 29:2

264

the time needed to perceptually encode the visual stimulus (inspection time). A
more fine-grained RT paradigm is needed to do this, for example, defining the
time component from stimulus presentation to the release of a home button as
perceptual encoding and the time from release of the home button to pressing
the response button as motor speed (Bates & Eysenck, 1993). In addition, larger
sample sizes are needed to make more robust predictions for the BI and LI groups.
The significant partial correlations among tasks shown in Table 2 may suggest nothing more than a general component related to rapid execution rather
than any deeper relation (Savage & Frederickson, 2005). Given this caveat, the
pattern of association between some tasks bears further investigation to refine
the underlying constructs that the tasks may be assessing. This includes the predictably strong association between the two tasks using numeric stimuli, number
search and arithmetic, and the two visuospatial tasks, mental rotation and form
completion.
The developmental trajectories for each group also speak clearly to the effect of
age, but are particularly important for identifying task variability across age. Even
though the trajectories are for the easiest level in mental rotation (45 rotation)
and in form completion (two shapes to be assembled), there were substantial RT
differences in these two tasks beyond the effect of age. The other task where there
tended to be higher variability was arithmetic. These are the longest three tasks,
and they are thus much more vulnerable to be influenced by individual differences
in experience and strategy use than the other tasks. It is notable that the two
tasks that most clearly separated the LI group from the EO and BI groups, mental
rotation and arithmetic, also may be linked to individual variation in language
more directly than the other tasks. Also, there appears to be a flatter LI RT
trajectory across age for serial memory than there is for the EO group (see Figure
4a and e), with age accounting for a substantive proportion of EO but not LI task
performance (Table 3). Although age also accounted for no significant variance in
serial memory performance for the BI group, the variability in this smaller group
precludes robust interpretation. Serial memory was a task in which the EO and LI
groups showed a strikingly equivalent mean RT, although EO accuracy was higher.
The developmental trajectory provides additional information that distinguishes
the performance of these two groups.
Overall, we cannot assume that all nonlinguistic tasks are equally sensitive to
the LI profile. There is a clear need for systematic cross-task and cross-stimulus
comparisons to describe specific nonlinguistic deficits in LI and to identify the
underlying mechanisms that are associated with different instances of diverse
language learning. Finally, as the linguistic and cultural diversity of the United
States increases, there is a compelling practical need to develop assessment tools
that are not biased against children who have a native language other than English. Nonlinguistic measures that deemphasize language ability may provide an
additional avenue to address this need.
