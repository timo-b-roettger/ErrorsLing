a b s t r a c t
Selective attention to grapheme-phoneme mappings during learning can impact the circuitry subsequently recruited during reading. Here we trained literate adults to read two novel scripts of glyph words
containing embedded letters under different instructions. For one script, learners linked each embedded
letter to its corresponding sound within the word (grapheme-phoneme focus); for the other, decoding
was prevented so entire words had to be memorized. Post-training, ERPs were recorded during a reading
task on the trained words within each condition and on untrained but decodable (transfer) words. Within
this condition, reaction-time patterns suggested both trained and transfer words were accessed via sublexical units, yet a left-lateralized, late ERP response showed an enhanced left lateralization for transfer
words relative to trained words, potentially reflecting effortful decoding. Collectively, these findings
show that selective attention to grapheme-phoneme mappings during learning drives the lateralization
of circuitry that supports later word recognition. This study thus provides a model example of how
different instructional approaches to the same material may impact changes in brain circuitry.

1. Introduction
Success in early reading acquisition depends on a learner's
ability to master the association between spoken words and their
corresponding visual word forms. When learning these mappings,
a student may attend to individual letters and link them to sounds
within a word, thus focusing on sublexical grapheme-phoneme
mappings. Alternatively, the budding reader might attend to larger
grain sizes, such as letter clusters, onsets, rimes, or even whole
words (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005). Reading development theories
concur that gaining robust grapheme-phoneme connections is vital
for achieving reading proficiency (Ehri, 1991; Frith, 1985; Gough &
Juel, 1991). In addition to promoting the refinement of known word
representations (Perfetti, 1991), proficiency in manipulating
attained grapheme-phoneme associations serves as a crucial selfteaching device, which enables beginning readers to decode novel
words that they have not encountered previously (Share &
Stanovich, 1995). Overall, relative to approaches that promote
memorization of the spelling patterns of entire words, sublexical
phonics-based strategies yield superior reading acquisition outcomes according to behavioral cognitive psychology meta-analyses

(e.g., Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, & Seidenberg, 2001) and
systematic investigations of curriculum effects (e.g., Ehri, Nunes,
Stahl, & Willows, 2001).
Reading instruction has valuable potential for directing a
student's attention to representations at grain sizes that bolster
the acquisition of reliable alphabetic and word knowledge
(McCandliss, Beck, Sandak, & Perfetti, 2003). The need for specific
attentional guidance during learning is highlighted by the fact that,
upon viewing a word, this gamut of grain sizes is available - all at
once - to a beginning reader. Additionally, although grapheme-phoneme decoding is typically advantageous, skilled reading of exception words, which cannot be decoded, requires fluent switching
between grain sizes. Given the central role of grapheme-phoneme
conversion for masterful reading, intentionally directing attention
to sublexical specifically subsyllabic mappings might be an essential
component of a learner's emerging decoding skills (McCandliss &
Yoncheva, 2011). The brain mechanisms of this process remain largely unexplored yet are pivotal to understanding how instructional
strategies can best be harnessed to support the development of the
perceptual expertise for reading (McCandliss, 2010).
Skilled reading engages specialized brain processes allowing
rapid categorization of orthographic input as language. One of
the earliest print-sensitive responses indexed in the event-related
potential (ERP) is the N170 visual word effect, typically characterized as greater occipito-temporal negativity within 200 ms of

viewing a word relative to a visually matched control stimulus.
This N170 response temporally coincides with the time-window
that reflects initial word recognition in eye movement studies
(for review, see Posner & McCandliss, 1993). The educational
experience of learning to read one's own language is crucial for
the tuning of the N170 effect to the specific properties of one's
native script. Language-specific effects in the perceptual expertise
for visual words have been reported in literate adults when reading
a known, relative to an unfamiliar, script in another language
(Wong, Gauthier, Woroch, DeBuse, & Curran, 2005). Similarly,
specific educational impact is evident in pre-literate children
who progress through their literacy training to eventually exhibit
native script sensitivity, characteristically left-lateralized as in
skilled adult readers (Brem et al., 2009). Studies examining the
visual word N170 response throughout reading skill accruement
often report accompanying modulations of later ERP components
(Brem et al., 2006; Brem et al., 2009; Maurer, Blau, Yoncheva, &
McCandliss, 2010). These include the N400 component, thought
to reflect deeper semantic processing as commonly revealed by
comparing expected with unexpected sentence endings (Kutas &
Federmeier, 2011), and the Late Positivity Complex (LPC) family
of components often attributed to domain-general engagement
of learning, attention, and memory functions (Polich, 2007). In
the context of reading, LPC effects can be sensitive to old/new word
recognition (Friedman, 1990) and explicit/implicit memorization
effects frequently observed under repeated word presentation
(Rugg et al., 1998). Either or both phenomena might be relevant
to emergent decoding skills.
Orthographic (e.g., Dehaene & Cohen, 2011) as well as phonological processes (e.g., Vigneau et al., 2006) are predominantly left-lateralized in fluent readers (for review, see Schlaggar & McCandliss,
2007). Moreover, across individuals the left lateralization of reading-related activations is tightly coupled with the left lateralization
of activations linked to speech perception (Pinel & Dehaene, 2010).
Visual and spoken word lateralization are also systematically influenced by both genetic and environmental factors (Pinel et al., 2014).
Importantly, selective attention to language can engage this left-lateralized integrated network in a purely top-down fashion in skilled
readers: in the absence of visual input, phonological computations
recruit the visual word form area yet acoustic non-linguistic judgments on this same word pair do not (Yoncheva, Zevin, Maurer, &
McCandliss, 2010). Furthermore, selective attention to phonology
can shape perception by modulating processes as early as online
stimulus encoding via transient, temporally specific engagement
of orthographic and phonological regions within the left hemisphere (Yoncheva, Maurer, Zevin, & McCandliss, 2014). Such attentional processes may influence neural circuitry during initial
learning and thus impact later word recognition. Thus the exact
relation between such modulations and learning beckons direct
investigation within an approach that combines educational manipulations, learning, and functional brain imaging.
1.1. The current study: approach, questions, and hypotheses
Motivated by accumulating evidence that selective attention to
grapheme-phoneme mappings dynamically recruits left-lateralized linguistic processes, the present ERP study addressed questions
central to a beginner's grapheme-phoneme (GP) decoding during
reading. Early reading acquisition was modeled in a well-controlled
paradigm training literate, adult English speakers to read artificial
scripts. This manipulation allowed us to investigate - in relative isolation from other, typically confounded factors (e.g., ongoing print
exposure, stimulus properties, training time, and a learner's preexisting attentional biases) - how attentional focus shapes subsequent reading responses. Two artificial scripts were created: a GP
script, in which each grapheme mapped consistently onto a single

phoneme, and another, whole-word (WW) script, in which the pairing between individual graphemes and corresponding phonemes
was arbitrary across training trials. Any putative incidentally
acquired knowledge of particular letter-sound associations in the
WW script was therefore not generalizable to decoding transfer
(not previously trained) words, forcing learners to further attend
to WW-level mappings. Training was implemented by concurrent
presentation of frequent, single-syllable spoken English words and
their corresponding artificial script representations. Following
training, each learner completed a reading verification task while
we recorded their behavioral and ERP responses.
First, we tested the hypothesis that GP decoding engages left-lateralized processes and examined the time-course of this visual word
ERP modulation. The theoretical focus of this paper, the left-lateralized N170 effect, is linked more closely to overall script familiarity
rather than knowledge of particular visual word forms (Yoncheva,
Blau, Maurer, & McCandliss, 2010); therefore we anticipated decoding-related ERP modulations to manifest after the initial perceptual
categorization indexed by the N170 component, while active decoding processes were at play, e.g., during the N400 or the LPC ERP components. Second, we examined how attending to GP mappings
during learning biases a learner's subsequent reading. Response
latencies were studied first focusing on trials where a visual word
did not match the concurrent single-syllable auditory word.
Contrasting latencies during verification of syllable onsets (i.e., initial consonant) relative to syllable rimes (i.e., central vowel and final
consonant) provided a behavioral assay likely reflective of decoding
processes. To more directly link observed effects to the impact of
attentional focus on GP grain sizes, behavioral and visual ERP
responses to words trained under GP focus were contrasted with
responses to words trained under WW focus, since the two training
conditions were equated for total exposure and learning time. We
expected to find reading expertise effects, indexed by a left-lateralized N170 response, only when the same student read the script
learned under selective focus to GP mappings and not under WW
focus. Capitalizing on high-density recordings to capture ERP topographic differences and on Bayesian statistics to temporally localize
attentional effects, we carried out data-driven analyses unconstrained by a priori assumptions and examined the duration and persistence of effects throughout and following the N170 component.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
Native English-speaking, right-handed (Oldfield, 1971) volunteers
were recruited for the study. Each participant was neurologically
healthy with normal hearing and normal, or corrected-to-normal,
vision, and was screened for reading disability and prior knowledge
of logographic scripts, such as Chinese. To ensure that every subject
attended to the training and showed learning progress, accuracy
greater than 85% on the average of the two training conditions in
the final test of trained words on day 1 was required to invite participants for the second day session, which included the EEG recording
(two subjects did not reach criterion). Further, two additional subjects
did not meet the ERP data quality criterion detailed in 3.2. ERP preprocessing. Data from 16 participants (mean age: 21.7 years, range:
18-31; 8 women) are reported here. Ethical approval was granted
by the Institutional Review Board of Vanderbilt University. All
subjects were fully briefed and provided written informed consent.
2.2. Training in artificial orthography
2.2.1. Procedure
Each participant learned to associate sets of auditory words
with corresponding visual characters under two training

Y.N. Yoncheva et al. / Brain & Language 145-146 (2015) 23-33

conditions: grapheme-phoneme (GP) and whole-word (WW). The
training in both conditions was identical except for the different
instruction slide in the beginning of the training phase prescribing
the use of one of the two strategies: GP (focus on the embedded
letter-figures and associate each of the three sounds of the word
to a given letter-figure within the glyph) and WW (focus on the
whole glyph and link it to the spoken word) (Fig. 1).
Training took place over two consecutive days, 24 h apart. On
each day, participants were trained on one word list per condition.
Training was broken into three alternating training blocks per condition. Each block contained seven repetitions of a word. After
every training block, participants were tested in a two-alternative
forced choice whether the visual word character matched with an
auditory word. If the training was in the GP condition, the participant was additionally tested on a transfer list that assessed the
accrual of alphabetic knowledge, as indexed by ability to decode
transfer words composed of known letter-figures within a character. At the end of the second day, after the six sessions, all participants completed the EEG reading verification task experiment.
After the EEG experiment, participants answered a series of
questions probing adoption of a GP or WW strategy throughout
learning. For the WW (control) condition, subjects also elaborated
on their personal approach to memorizing the entire characters
(e.g., imagining how the shape of the visual character might
remind them of the spoken word's meaning). None of these
whole-word memorization strategies involved alphabetic knowledge. All subjects reported compliance with the prescribed
strategy.
2.2.2. Stimuli
Single-syllable, consonant-vowel-consonant English words
were created using six consonants (b, d, k, n, s, t) and four vowels
(a, u, e, i). The embedded letter-like figures were novel black line
drawings on white background, and each character subtended
2.4 horizontal by 2.6 vertical visual angle. The spoken words
(average duration = 600 ms; SD = 55 ms) were recorded by a
female native English speaker.
2.2.3. Word list selection
Each student was trained on 4 lists of English words associated
with glyphs. The 4 lists of spoken English words were used to algorithmically generate WW and GP glyph stimuli by converting the
initial consonant, vowel, and final consonant into individual glyph
segments. This allowed us to counterbalance the four word lists
across training condition (GP, WW). At the orthographic level of
analysis, the letter position distribution and combination of units
were equivalent between the GP and WW sets of glyphs.
However, at the level of mapping of orthographic units to phonological representations, the sets differed to preclude possible learning of grapheme-phoneme mappings during the WW training
condition. Unlike the GP glyphs, the mapping between WW glyphs
and spoken English words was arbitrary, i.e., each ``letter'' was
paired with different sounds during training. For each letter in
the GP glyph set, an analogous letter existed in the WW glyph

25

set, and it appeared with equal frequency in each position and
within each bigram across the two sets, thereby preserving the statistical letter probabilities at the orthographic level across the two
training scripts.
On each of the two training days, a student was trained on two
lists that were unique to that training day: one presented within
the GP condition and another presented within the WW condition.
This also enabled counterbalancing the 4 lists across assignment to
training session (first day, second day) and assignment of list to
position within training session (first, second).
Each word list consisted of 12 unique words. Every list contained six consonants (appearing in the first and last positions
twice in each list) and four vowels (each appearing three times
in a list). Two additional six-word transfer lists (each with equated
letter frequency in each position) were used to monitor progress
on use of the GP rules acquired during training to decode untrained
words. Transfer lists were counterbalanced across the 16 participants. To create mismatch trials, each word in the list was paired
with a corresponding foil from the same list, designed to differ at
one of two levels of orthographic/phonological position within
the syllable: the onset unit (i.e., first consonant) or the rime unit
(i.e., the central vowel and final consonant). Thus, mismatch trials
either shared onset and differed in rime, or conversely, differed in
onset and shared sounds in rime.
2.3. EEG
2.3.1. EEG Reading verification task
The reading verification task was a two-alternative forced
choice task. Participants rapidly decided whether the presented
visual word character matched with the auditory word (Fig. 2). A
trial commenced with fixation (mean duration 750 ms) followed
by the presentation of a visual character (mean duration
2000 ms). Next, an auditory word (mean duration 600 ms) was
presented at a normally distributed jitter ranging from 667 to
1000 ms after the onset of the visual character. After an average
of 3000 ms (2500-3500 ms), during which participants could
respond, the next trial began. Three types of visual characters were
presented in mini-blocks: GP-trained, WW-trained, and GP-transfer (unfamiliar but decodable) words. Each training day contributed an equal number of trained words, resulting in miniblocks composed of twelve unique words repeated twice, once as
a target and once as a foil. Conditions were presented with equal
probability in each position over five consecutive mini-blocks.
Participants could take breaks between the mini-blocks. Overall,
the task lasted approximately 60 min. EEG was recorded and
ERPs time-locked to onset of the visual character are reported.
2.3.2. EEG recording and preprocessing
The 128-channel EEG was acquired using a Hydrocel Geodesic
Sensor Net (Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, Oregon) referenced
to the vertex electrode. Data were sampled at 1000 Hz/channel
with calibrated technical zero baselines and a low-pass filter set
at 0.1 Hz. Electrode impedances were maintained below 50 kO.

Fig. 1. Manipulating attentional focus during training. Each student learned a set of English words focusing on grapheme-phoneme (GP) mappings, and another, in a different
script, focusing on whole-word (WW) mappings. Learning conditions and duration were identical for the training conditions apart from the instruction slide at the onset of
training.

Fig. 2. EEG reading verification task. On each trial learners indicated whether or not
the written glyph and the spoken word matched. Short blocks of words trained
under GP and WW focus were presented. Alphabetic transfer words, i.e., unfamiliar
but decodable based on learned GP mappings, were tested in separate blocks. ERPs
time-locked to the onset of the visual word were analyzed.

Spline interpolation was applied to channels with excessive artifacts (on average 11.6 channels per subject), followed by eye blink
correction in BESA 5.3 Research software (Berg & Scherg, 1994).
EEG data were then digitally band-pass filtered (0.1-30 Hz,
24 dB/oct), epoched from 200 ms pre-stimulus (visual character)
to 800 ms post-stimulus. Artifacts exceeding  100 lV in any channel were automatically rejected. Single-subject averaging was done
separately for each condition on correct trials only. In Brain Vision
Analyzer 2.0, ERPs were transformed to the average reference
(Lehmann & Skrandies, 1980), and grand averages and Global
Field Power (GFP) were computed separately for each condition
and - for the purposes of adaptive segmentation and quantitative
ERP quality control - collapsed across all conditions. Any individual that had did not produce a GFP peak N1 response that was
equal to or greater than nine times the baseline GFP response
was excluded from further analysis.
2.3.3. ERP analyses
The analysis strategy involved a data-driven approach sensitive
to topographic differences, including lateralization (Yoncheva,
Blau, et al., 2010; Yoncheva et al., 2014). First, we identified
time-intervals where significant differences between conditions
of interest occurred, indicating differential perceptual and/or cognitive processing (i.e., segmentation). Then, ERPs were averaged
across these time-intervals, and the resulting segments were
directly contrasted between conditions with respect to map
strength, topography, and latency.
2.3.3.1. Segmentation. Topographic bootstrapping tests (topographic analysis of variance, TANOVA (Strik, Fallgatter, Brandeis,
& Pascual-Marqui, 1998)) on raw ERP maps were conducted
because TANOVA detects systematic topographic differences and
overall amplitude variations between the contrasted conditions.
To this end, global dissimilarity for each time-point was computed

(Lehmann & Skrandies, 1980; Strik et al., 1998), and subsequently a
probability distribution was created (randomization test with 5000
re-samplings (Manly, 1991)). Finally, a z-score of the original dissimilarity in relation to its respective distribution was calculated.
The multiple comparisons problem was addressed by an unified
algorithm, which first fitted an empirical null model and then estimated tail, area-based and local, density-based false discovery
rates (fdr) based on a modified Grenander-density estimator
(Strimmer, 2008a). This approach was chosen for several reasons.
First, the empirical model fitting deals with the time-sample correlations inherent to the time domain (Efron, 2007). Additionally, the
truncation point for model fitting is selected to minimize false nondiscovery rate, i.e., type II error, increasing leverage in interpreting
both significant and non-significant findings (Efron, 2004). Finally,
the estimated local false discovery rate represents the empirical
Bayesian posterior probability of the null hypothesis, which is
readily interpretable unlike some variants of corrected
p-values. The fdrtool algorithm, strimmerlab.org/software/fdrtool
(Strimmer, 2008b), as part of the R package archive from CRAN
(R Development Core Team., 2007) was used for this analysis with
input z-scores for each time-point, separately for each condition of
interest. Statistical significance was set at local fdr p < 0.05. This
procedure was previously applied to other independent ERP data
sets (Yoncheva, Maurer, Zevin, & McCandliss, 2013; Yoncheva
et al., 2014). Finally, to address which robust ERP components were
modulated by experimental manipulation as revealed by TANOVA
differences, an adaptive segmentation based on GFP minima was
also performed (Lehmann & Skrandies, 1980) indicating that 72-
144 ms corresponded to the P1; 144-306 ms corresponded to the
N1, while late positivity complex (LPC) components spanned
306-375 and 375-581 ms.
Given our two central questions, separate segmentation was
carried out for each condition of interest.
2.3.3.1.1. Effects of alphabetic decoding. To isolate when reading
novel decodable words modulated the ERP response, a raw-map
TANOVA contrasting GP-transfer with GP-trained words was
adopted in the 0-500 ms range. Significant differences were found
in three time-intervals: 324-336 ms; 363-387 ms and 399-
453 ms (local fdr p < 0.05, fitting parameters: g0 = 0.179 with
SD = 0.32). These intervals were used as time-windows for LPC segmentation. Due to our a priori interest in lateralization, for these
LPC modulations we focus on positive centroid positions on the
x-axis.
2.3.3.1.2. Effects of attentional training focus. To isolate when words
trained under GP focus were differentially processed from ones
trained under WW focus, a direct raw-map TANOVA contrasting
GP-trained with WW-trained words was performed for each
time-point in the 0-500 ms range. Significant differences were
found only from 197 to 222 ms (local fdr p < 0.05, fitting parameters: g0 = 0.946 with SD = 1.28). This time-interval was characterized by an N170 topography and concurrent with the N1
component, and thus was selected as the N170 segmentation
interval.
2.3.3.2. Map strength, topography, and latency summary
measures. Within each TANOVA-selected time-segment individual's potentials were averaged to produce a mean map for each
condition. The topography of each mean map was reduced to six
descriptors using 3D centroids (averaged, voltage-weighted electrode positions of positive and negative map areas (Brandeis,
Vitacco, & Steinhausen, 1994) in Talairach space). Between-condition position differences of the negative centroids specifically on
the x-axis (left-right) were reported to test the hypothesis that
attentional focus modulates N170 lateralization. Map strength
was indexed by its GFP (i.e., the spatial standard deviations of
the voltages in that map) (Lehmann & Skrandies, 1980). In line

27

Y.N. Yoncheva et al. / Brain & Language 145-146 (2015) 23-33

with our whole-map analysis approach, latencies were determined
via topographical component recognition (TCR) (Brandeis, Naylor,
Halliday, Callaway, & Yano, 1992; methodological strengths discussed on page 273 in Luck, 2014). The TCR approach has been successfully used across different investigations of N170 lateralization
(Brem et al., 2006; Maurer, Zevin, & McCandliss, 2008). First, a template map was created by computing the grand-averaged map
within TANOVA-selected segments, averaged across conditions
from potentials that have been GFP-normalized in order to prevent
bias by stronger maps. Then, within the boundaries of the relevant
ERP component, the topographically most similar time-point in
individual's ERP (as determined by maximal correlation) was
selected as the latency for that condition.
2.3.3.3. Statistical analyses. Analyses of GFP, centroid locations, and
latencies were conducted in SPSS v18. Multivariate analyses of
variance (MANOVA) for repeated measures with within-subject
factor learning condition (WW-, GP-trained characters) were performed, as well as planned comparisons separately of GP-trained
with GP-transfer words. The centroid analyses included polarity
(positive, negative centroid) as an additional factor, and the three
location dimensions of the centroids (x-, y-, and z-axes) were treated as multivariate dependent measures. Polarity is only reported
when it interacts with other factors. Effects on the x-axis indicate
lateralization effects: negative x-values correspond to left
lateralization.
Finally, to facilitate comparison with conventional ERP analyses,
the grand-average waveforms time-locked to visual word onset,
shown separately for GP-trained, GP-transfer, and WW-trained
words, are presented. Nine non-overlapping channel clusters are
created by selecting the approximate 10-10 equivalents of hallmark channels (Luu & Ferree, 2000), finding their immediate
neighbors, and averaging ERP potentials within the cluster. The
resulting clusters are: ``FC5'' (E28 and E20, E24, E27, E29, E34,
E35); ``FCz'' (E6 and E5, E7, E12, E13, E106, E112); ``FC6'' (E117
and E110, E111, E116, E118, E123, E124); ``CP5'' (E47 and E41,
E42, E46, E51, E52); ``CPz'' (E55 and Cz, E31, E54, E79, E80);
``CP6'' (E98 and E92, E93, E97, E102, E103); ``PO7'' (E65 and E58,
E59, E64, E66, E69, E70); ``POz'' (E72 and E62, E67, E71, E76, E7);
``PO8'' (E90 and E83, E84, E89, E91, E95, E96).''
3. Behavioral data analyses
To assess overall processing difficulty across tasks, accuracy and
reaction times (RT; 5% trimmed mean RTs on correct trials reported
in ms from spoken word onset) were computed for each condition.
First, echoing the ERP analyses, planned comparisons were performed contrasting GP-trained with GP-transfer words (alphabetic
decoding effect) and contrasting GP-trained with WW-trained
words (attentional training focus effect). Additionally, to directly
assess the potential contribution of task difficulty (average of zscored RTs and error rates) as a mediator of the differential N170
lateralization for GP relative to WW training, a bootstrap Sobel test
followed the main analysis (Sobel, 1982).
Secondly, to assess issues regarding the grain size accessed during word recognition under the different training conditions, reaction times were investigated to directly examine the impact of
sublexical overlap between the visual and the auditory word
within a trial. This analysis capitalized on the trial design, which
manipulated the position of the initial disambiguating information
for deciding whether or not the visual word corresponded to the
single-syllable spoken word. Initial mismatch could occur at the
onset unit of the syllable (e.g., /t-I-n/ vs. /k-I-d/) or at the rime unit
(i.e., /k-ae-t/ vs. /k-I-d/). Trial types based on whether the onset
within a `no' trial was the same or different were collapsed and

contrasted directly within each condition (GP-trained, GP-transfer,
WW-trained). Our trial types could not be segregated to uniquely
inform second relative to third letter mismatches within the rime
unit of the syllable due to practical constraints. Namely, foils were
engineered to be English words that were being taught in the same
training session and the number of combinations of six consonants
(first and third position) and four vowels (always second position),
which create frequent English words, is inherently limited.
Additionally, within each of the 3 training conditions, we contrasted `yes' with `no' trials. Within `no' trials, higher RTs for shared
onset than for different onset would indicate an impact of alphabetic grain sizes on RTs and plausibly implicate underlying alphabetic decoding. Such an onset verification effect is expected most
notably for GP-transfer words, but also for GP-trained words, if
participants still focus on the GP mappings acquired throughout
learning. WW-trained words should produce equivalent RTs
regardless of sublexical overlap position. Directly contrasting
`yes' with `no' trials for the GP-trained and WW-trained words
would help inform whether differential facilitation for trained
exemplars is produced by the two attentional focus training conditions. For WW trained words, endorsements of familiar words are
expected to be faster than rejections.

4. Results
4.1. Behavioral results
Performance in the reading verification task for words trained
under WW focus was more accurate (t(15) = 8.58, p < 0.001) and
faster (t(15) = 5.54, p < 0.001) than for words trained under GP
focus as shown in Table 1, in line with previous short-term training
results (Yoncheva, Blau, et al., 2010).
Importantly, accuracy for transfer words was much greater than
chance (t(15) = 15.37, p < 0.001). Further, despite slower reaction
times (t(15) = 4.9, p < 0.001), the equivalent error rate for GP-transfer relative to GP-trained words (t(15) = 0.32, p = 0.76) suggested
that participants were sensitive to sublexical unit organization
when reading GP trained words as well as GP transfer words
(Table 1).
A finer-grain analysis directly assessing how the position of letter-sound mismatch impacts response latencies revealed modulation patterns that notably differed between the two scripts while
remaining broadly consistent within the GP script. When decoding
GP-transfer words, participants were faster to reject foils where
the mismatch was at syllable onset rather than syllable rime
(t(15) = 2.29, p < 0.05). An analogous trend was detected when
decoding GP-trained words (t(15) = 1.31, p = 0.1). It was confirmed
that for the WW script, a mismatch at onset relative to rime did not
affect response latencies (t(15) = 0.06, p = 0.5). Notably, for the
WW script, `yes' trials were faster than `no' trials (t(15) = 4.57,
p < 0.0005), as expected for over-trained exemplars. In contrast,
latencies to reject GP-transfer foils showed the opposite pattern
and were greater than these to endorse a match, t(15) = 2.30,
p < 0.05. GP-trained words showed no difference between `yes'
and `no' trials, t(15) = 0.75, p = 0.5 (Fig. 3).

LPC2: t(15) = 1.26, p = 0.23; LPC3: t(15) = 0.43, p = 0.97).

Reaction times reported from the onset of the spoken word. On mismatch trials, we
manipulated whether the onset syllable unit was shared (and the rime unit
differed) or whether the onset syllable unit differed between the visual and the
spoken word. Match trials presented familiar words. Onset verification was
significantly faster relative to rime verification for GP-transfer words, as well as
for GP-trained words. WW-trained words show an RT advantage of word
familiarity.

4.2. ERP results
4.2.1. Differences between GP-trained and GP-transfer words in
consecutive ERP maps
Differential ERP responses over time based on visual word
familiarity were evaluated using a topographic analysis of variance
(TANOVA). Significant differences based on TANOVA were
observed at 324-336 ms (termed here LPC1); 363-387 ms (LPC2)
and 399-453 ms (LPC3). All three segments were characterized
by the same consistent LPC topography.
4.2.1.1. Topographic centroid effects. Left-lateralization of the positive centroid in the GP-transfer condition was tested in each of
the three LPC segments (LPC1: t(15) = 0.92, p = 0.19; LPC2:
t(15) = 0.11, p = 0.46; LPC3: t(15) = 1.63, p = 0.06). Further
investigation of the LPC3, the component showing the strongest
left lateralization for GP-transfer words, demonstrated that relative to WW-trained words, GP-transfer topographies were significantly more left-lateralized (t(15) = 2.44, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). This
held also for GP-trained words relative to WW-trained words during the LPC3 (t(15) = 1.91, p < 0.05). For the other two components
(LPC1 and LPC2), there was no difference between GP-transfer and
WW-trained (tmax = 0.94, pmin > 0.4) and no difference between GPtrained and WW-trained (tmax = 1.54, pmin > 0.15).
4.2.1.2. GFP. GFP for GP-trained and GP-transfer words were generally comparable (LPC1: t(15) = 1.92, p = 0.074; LPC2: t(15) = 0.39,
p = 0.70; LPC3: t(15) = 1.13, p = 0.28).

4.2.2. Differences between GP and WW-trained words in consecutive
ERP maps
Differential ERP responses over time based on training focus
were evaluated using a TANOVA. Processing visual words trained
under GP as opposed to WW focus differed (fdr p < 0.05) in the
197-222 ms time-range, which was characterized by an N170
topography. Further, an adaptive segmentation approach (collapsed over training strategy, thus reflecting the robust N1 ERP
response associated with visual word processing) corroborated
that the 197-222 ms segment fell within the boundaries of the
N1 component. Hence, this N170 segment was selected for further
investigation.
4.2.2.1. Topographic centroid effects. Centroid distribution differed
between WW-trained and GP-trained words (multivariate
MANOVA: polarity by training F(3, 13) = 6.098, p < 0.01; x-axis univariate: polarity by training F(3, 13) = 4.707, p < 0.05) with the negative centroid along the x-axis (i.e., left-right) being more negative
for GP-trained than for WW-trained words, indicating a more leftlateralized N170 negativity for GP-trained words (Fig. 5). The Sobel
test indicated that task difficulty was not a significant mediator of
the differential - by training condition - N170 lateralization
(z = 0.16, p = 0.85).
4.2.2.2. GFP. Reading GP-trained words evoked smaller GFP than
reading WW-trained words (1.55 lV  0.2 vs. 1.81  0.2 lV:
t(15) = 2.92 p < 0.05).
4.2.2.3. Latency. No significant differences were found between GPand WW-trained word latencies (t(15) = 1.08, p = 0.30).
4.2.3. Planned comparison: N170 of GP-trained and GP-transfer words
No significant whole-map differences between GP-trained and
GP-transfer words were present in the N170 interval.
Nevertheless, since a robust N170 response was notable in both
conditions, the positions of the negative centroids on the x-axis
were directly compared between the two conditions. N170 lateralization was equivalent for complete overlap between the GPtrained and GP-transfer words (t(15) = 1.22, p = 0.24). No N170
latency differences were detected (t(15) = 0.73, p = 0.48). GFP when
reading GP-trained and GP-transfer words was also comparable
(t(15) = 0.43 p = 0.67).

5. Discussion
Selective attention to grapheme-phoneme (GP) mappings
throughout training in an artificial script drastically biased behavioral and ERP responses in later tests. Specifically, reaction time
patterns showed evidence of differential onset relative to rime verification when reading GP words suggesting that alphabetic decoding was readily engaged upon subsequent encounters of the GP
script. Notably, decoding visual words that were not previously
trained, as opposed to familiar words in the same GP script, produced a left-lateralized ERP modulation of the late positivity complex (LPC) response. Finally, despite identical stimulus exposure
and training times for the two scripts, the left-lateralized N170
perceptual expertise for visual words was only observed when
reading words that had been trained under GP attentional focus
and not under WW focus.
5.1. Decoding familiar visual word forms
Greater left lateralization was evident for words in the GP script
that were not previously trained relative to words in that script
that were specifically trained, potentially indicating effortful
decoding processes in a time-window approximately 400 to
450 ms, as characterized by whole-map divergence (fdr p < 0.05).
The LPC topography characterizing this segment would be broadly
consistent with domain-general modulations of post-perceptual
processes (Polich, 2007). For instance, differential LPC engagement
might be associated with differential memory strength for
entire words relative to constituent letters (Friedman, 1990).
Furthermore, decoding transfer words might engage explicit recall
of grapheme-phoneme mappings to a greater extent than decoding trained words. In the context of reading expertise development,
recent studies seem to show additional later ERP modulations of
visual word processing at least under implicit reading conditions
(Brem et al., 2006; Brem et al., 2009). Such observations might
speculatively be related to differential automaticity of the
emergent decoding skills that are not specifically needed for task
performance. This interpretation dovetails with our previous findings of training-induced ERP changes that showed an LPC-like modulation in addition to the N170 learning effect, when probed in a
phonologically shallow, implicit reading task (Maurer et al., 2010).
Interestingly, the modulated time-window showed a significantly right-lateralized topography in the WW script suggesting
lack of engagement of left-lateralized linguistic processes to any
recently trained, control script. Notably, the decoding ERP effect

was not merely a sustained modulation of lateralization carried
over from the N170 effect but seemed to reflect a distinct engagement of decoding processes. Not inconsistent with a growing body
of studies mapping phonological to orthographic influences
(Pattamadilok, Knierim, Kawabata Duncan, & Devlin, 2010; Pinel
et al., 2014), we recently suggested that attentional influences
may act on the early integration of grapheme and phoneme representations. Specifically, an fMRI study revealed that a left-lateralized network, including the visual word form area, was
differentially engaged when focusing attention on phonological as
opposed to general acoustic features (Yoncheva, Zevin, et al.,
2010). This was the case when contrasting two equally difficult
tasks performed on identical auditory stimuli (combining speech
and tones), thus isolating the impact of attentional focus on phonology, and demonstrating how such focus impacts regions associated
with orthography, even in the absence of any visual stimulation. In
a parallel paradigm, ERP responses during stimulus encoding were
shown to be modulated by intentionally focusing on phonological
distinctions within spoken words (Yoncheva et al., 2014). In both
the fMRI and the ERP studies, these top-down attentional effects
were observed without visual word presentation. In light of these
convergent findings, the current left-lateralized engagement may
reflect aspects of acquired print-to-speech associations, rather than
mere attentional biases on phonological processing.
Behavioral response latency analyses at a finer grain size scale
(Ziegler & Goswami, 2005) provided a more direct link to decoding
processes, inaccessible in aggregate RTs. The central question of
the current experiment involved isolating selective attention,
which required task demands, i.e., reading verification, to be kept
identical across all attentional focus conditions. However, we
manipulated, within the constraints of a limited set of frequent
English words, the visual-auditory stimulus pairing in `no' trials
to allow examining the effect of onset relative to rime verification
on behavioral performance. When rejecting mismatching pairs in
the GP script, faster RTs were observed when the first sound was
the different from, rather than the same as, the first letter.
Importantly, this onset/rime verification auditory RT effect was
present for both transfer and trained words, albeit as a non-significant trend for trained items. In contrast, the manipulation of grain
size in stimulus pairing produced no effect on behavioral performance for the WW script. The finding that onset match/mismatch
biased responses within the GP script, but elicited no differences
when reading the WW script suggests involvement of active GP
decoding when processing the GP script. Secondly, in the WW
script, latencies to endorse `yes' trials were found to be much faster
than ones to reject mismatching `no' trials. Despite identical training times for the two scripts, no such RT advantage was found for
processing the well-rehearsed, over-learned GP stimulus exemplars. Thus, the overall behavioral pattern of GP trained items
echoed more closely that of GP transfer words, rather than WW

Fig. 6. Grand-average waveforms time-locked to the onset of the visual word within the reading verification task at nine channel clusters. Three conditions are shown
separately: words that have been previously trained in the GP script (GP-trained, solid dark green), words that have not been previously trained in the GP script but are
decodable based on GP-mappings (GP-transfer, dotted green), and words that have been trained in the WW script (WW-trained, solid gold). The 9 sites cover approximately
the 10-10 equivalents of fronto-central (top row), centro-parietal (middle row), and occipito-parietal (bottom row) in the left hemisphere (odd numbered channels, leftmost
column), midline, and the right hemisphere (even numbered channels, rightmost column). Gray vertical rectangles illustrate significant intervals (fdr p < 0.05) based on the
whole-map TANOVA analyses. Highlighted are the two sites - PO7 and PO8 - in which the whole-map effect of attentional focus during learning (contrasting GP-trained with
WW-trained words in the N170 segment) and the effect of decoding (contrasting GP-trained with GP-transfer words in the LPC segment) are most prominent. Notable also is
the lack of differences between GP-trained and GP-transfer word processing during the N170 interval.

trained words. This provides complementary evidence that even
after extensive training, reading trained words in the GP script
can evoke active decoding processes. The present GP visual ERP
effects also likely reflect these trained patterns of selective attention to GP mappings.
Single-letter processing seems to elicit differential responses
relative to letter strings in skilled readers (Coch, Hart, & Mitra,

2008; James, James, Jobard, Wong, & Gauthier, 2005; Stevens,
McIlraith, Rusk, Niermeyer, & Waller, 2013). Intriguingly, it is the
relative pattern of lateralization of the N170 effect that differs
between single letter and letter string viewing (Stevens et al.,
2013). Moreover, elegant developmental work suggests that the
type of experience through which reading knowledge is accrued
(e.g., writing or viewing) can powerfully modulate the circuitry

Y.N. Yoncheva et al. / Brain & Language 145-146 (2015) 23-33

subsequently engaged in reading (Butler, James, & James, 2011;
James, 2010). Finally, far from being static, along its protracted
development a learner's performance typically shows differential
characteristics, proposed to reflect distinct reading phases relevant
to the degree to which alphabetic processing has been consolidated (e.g., amalgamation theory Ehri, 1991), which naturally
interacts with propensity to focus on different grain sizes. Our current visual ERP and behavioral findings further highlight the
importance of delineating the factors relevant to decoding as
opposed to whole word familiarity in order to ensure that the budding reader's attention is focused on the appropriate grain sizes.
5.2. Training focus impacts subsequent reading expertise recruitment
Under identical task demands - reading verification - and following identical training time, whole-map topographic ERP differences (fdr p < 0.05) between WW and GP training conditions were
observed only during the time interval coinciding with the typical
engagement of the N170 perceptual expertise for reading. The only
difference between the two conditions was that the same learner
was prevented from using a GP strategy when training on the
WW script. Notably, the current within-subjects design controls
for relevant differences among learners, which might generate
biases in the degree of a student's engagement in one strategy
(e.g., GP) relative to another (e.g., WW) during learning (for an
example of such effects in extreme preference readers, see Wise,
Yoncheva, & McCandliss, 2011). Additionally, the subjects we
report on had no prior knowledge of logographic scripts, which
minimized potential meaningful inter-individual learning differences due to propensity or skill to focus on WW as opposed to
GP strategy.
The functional asymmetry of visual word processing in skilled
readers holds interest from different theoretical perspectives.
After assessing genetic and environmental factors, Pinel and colleagues have argued that an individual's lateralization of spoken
language shapes the extent to which their responses to visual
words are more strongly left-lateralized (Pinel et al., 2014).
Further, Seghier and Price have used fMRI to delineate sub-regions
of left ventral occipito-temporal cortex, demonstrating spatial segregation of sub-regions predominantly activated by semantic as
opposed to visual properties of written words (Seghier & Price,
2011). We have theorized that selective attention to phonology
drives the development of the left-lateralized reading expertise
effect (McCandliss & Yoncheva, 2011) and have supported this idea
with empirical demonstrations that attentional focus on language
can co-activate phonological and left-lateralized orthographic circuits (Yoncheva, Zevin, et al., 2010; Yoncheva et al., 2014). Most
theories concur that examining the relative strength of hemispheric contributions to reading-relevant brain responses is more
fruitful than merely ascribing processes to each hemisphere in isolation from the other (McCandliss & Yoncheva, 2011; Pinel &
Dehaene, 2010; Seghier & Price, 2011). Indeed, relative lateralization assays have provided valid correlates of reading processing
(Brem et al., 2009; Maurer et al., 2008; Maurer et al., 2010;
Yoncheva, Blau, et al., 2010) and have collectively suggested that
the degree of N170 lateralization may be influenced by training
focus, task demands, and familiarity with script. Against this backdrop, our investigation highlights the unique contribution of a
specific process - selective attention to GP mappings - as key to
the recruitment of the predominantly left-lateralized language
network.
Short-term training lasting only two days was sufficient to produce robust ERP differences when learners read a novel script. An
analogous pattern of ERP and behavioral results has been shown
even following a twenty-minute learning session (Yoncheva,
Blau, et al., 2010). Such findings are consistent with recent

31

demonstrations of lateralization effects in the fusiform gyrus elicited by differential alphabetic as opposed to logographic training
over eight consecutive days (Mei et al., 2013). Likewise, modulations in activity of the visual word form area were evident after a
three-day language training (Song, Bu, Hu, Luo, & Liu, 2010).
Undoubtedly, perceptual expertise for reading develops progressively over years of exercising and honing one's decoding skills
(Brem et al., 2006). Gaining perceptual expertise for laboratorytrained objects, e.g., Greebles, also requires multiple hours of practice (reviewed in Bukach, Gauthier, & Tarr, 2006). Therefore, the
short time-scale of such adult training study findings on the order
of minutes or days might appear puzzling. The current fast emerging left-lateralized N170 effects are explained well by an assimilation learning account (Nelson, Liu, Fiez, & Perfetti, 2009), which
would suggest that skilled readers recruit their specialized network mediating perceptual expertise for visual linguistic information during novel learning and subsequent reading activities that
notably pose the same demands as reading in the native language.
The finding that only GP focus training produced novel script
assimilation into literate adult's reading expertise lends further
support to the idea that selective attention to GP mappings in particular is central in biasing which brain networks get trained, and
consequently honed, as a student progresses with training.
The ERP modulation we found based on prior attentional carryover notably manifested as a greater left-lateralization of the N170
topography to the alphabetic GP script in contrast with the more
right-lateralized N170 to the WW trained script. To further refine
the interpretation of the current ERP findings as reflecting attentional focus on grapheme-phoneme mappings, below we differentiate this construct from more general, perceptually driven forms
of attention known to bias early ERPs. First, visuo-spatial attention
are commonly characterized by retinotopic organization and a
latency corresponding to the P100 component of the visual ERP
(Woldorff et al., 1997). All current effects took place after this
time-window, and this was the case irrespective of whether attention was putatively directed left-to-right (current findings) or topto-bottom (Yoncheva, Blau, et al., 2010). Secondly, hierarchically
organized figures might engage focus on local as opposed to global
stimulus features. However, specific predictions regarding the timing and direction of ERP lateralization differences remain complex
given its sensitivity to experimental context (Beaucousin et al.,
2011; Hubner, 2014). Finally, the current ERP findings could be
potentially considered along the learning trajectory from controlled, attention-demanding processing to automatized processing (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977). After only two days of training
with room left to improve performance, and given that acquisition
of perceptual expertise takes many hours over multiple sessions of
training (reviewed in Bukach et al., 2006), it is reasonable to
assume that across all conditions subjects were still in the early
stages of learning well before automatic, attention-free processing.
Together, these considerations support the notion that the current
findings tap into a distinct, domain-specific type of selective attention to linguistic information.
A left-lateralized N170 response during reading verification of
GP words was observed relative to the more right-lateralized
N170 response for the WW script despite superior behavioral performance when reading the WW script. This opposing pattern of
ERP and behavioral results mirrors directly our previous findings
(Yoncheva, Blau, et al., 2010). Such correspondence might raise
the question of whether the lateralization of the ERP effect reflects
mere domain-general task difficulty differences in processing the
two scripts. A direct test demonstrated that task difficulty (reaction times or error rates) was not a significant mediator of the
effect of training condition on lateralization. Collectively, these
findings indicate that the left lateralization of the N170 response
robustly evoked by the GP script cannot be reduced to task

32

difficulty differences and instead indexes the GP focus exercised
during learning.
6. Conclusion
Collectively, the current results demonstrate how the left-lateralized networks that sub-serve phonological processing get
engaged under different training focus conditions and differential
need for active decoding during reading. Since the whole gamut
of grain sizes - from graphemes to entire words - is typically present during exposure to print, focusing beginning learners' attention is invaluable to ensure that their emerging decoding skills
are best supported and that perceptual expertise for visual words
is fluently integrated with left-lateralized phonological regions.
Notably, we show that the footprints of instruction are evident
well beyond training. The present findings underscore the role of
selective attention to grapheme-phoneme mappings during training in reading expertise acquisition with implications not only for
recognizing trained visual words but also for self-teaching of unfamiliar but decodable words.
