ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Language is constantly evolving through speakers' natural innovations. However, our
understanding of how subtle linguistic innovations are processed is still surprisingly limited. To
date, most studies investigating processing of non-conventional language have focused on
metaphors. Using both brain event-related potentials (ERPs) and offline judgements, the present
study investigated the acceptability, as well as the temporal dynamics, associated with
processing novel and conventional multiword units. By manipulating both the degree of
similarity and degree of conventionality, the results revealed that the acceptability of novel
items hinges on their similarity to known multiword units. ERPs revealed that similarity
modulated a late positive component (LPC) 550-750 ms after stimulus presentation; this LPC
was significantly correlated with acceptability. Additionally, processing of novel multiword units
was not modulated by exposure to related multiword units, indicating that similarity-based
processing was not dependent on recent prior exposure.

1. Introduction
One important aspect of the architecture of human cognition is that novel information is not only stored but, critically, integrated within a network of existing
representations (Backus et al., 2016; Bjork & Bjork,
1992; Gisquet-Verrier & Riccio, 2018; Lindsay & Gaskell,
2013; Schlichting & Preston, 2015; Tamminen et al.,
2010; Tulving & Thomson, 1973). Previous research on
the processing of creative language indicates that
incoming information is evaluated in real time as
related (or not) to existing memories, allowing to interpret even input that is novel and unfamiliar (e.g.
Coulson & Van Petten, 2007; Gentner, 1983, 1988;
Schlichting & Preston, 2015).
Production and comprehension of similarity-based
linguistic generalisation has been proposed to be a key
mechanism that allows speakers to expand their linguistic knowledge based on relational thinking, in which
novel and known information become integrated
(Baayen, 2003; Boas, 2003; Eddington, 2000; Lieven
et al., 1997). Linguistic innovations are believed to be
anchored in prior related experience (e.g. Bybee, 2010;
Goldberg, 2006, 2009), as is their comprehension. For
example, once familiar with the sentence "they eat the
cake", a speaker encountering "they eat the ..." will
expect an edible referent that shares some of the

semantic properties of related familiar exemplars
(Altmann & Kamide, 1999). That is, based on knowledge
of concrete multiword units ("eat the cake") cumulative
exposure to related exemplars ("eat the cookie"; "eat
her dinner") gradually gives rise to more abstract representations, (eat + [edible referent]) and, ultimately,
schematic constructions (verb + direct object) (Ellis &
Ferreira-Junior, 2009; Goldberg, 2006; Theakston et al.,
2015). Similarly, knowledge of familiar multiword units
(e.g. "to order a hamburger") would be thought to
enable the comprehension of novel utterances, even if
these are non-conventional and somewhat unexpected
(e.g. "order the leftovers") by virtue of their semantic
similarity; in contrast, a non-conventional phrase such
as "order the concern" is not relatable to any familiar representations, and cannot be immediately interpreted on
its own. Therefore, it has been proposed that "the probability and acceptability of a novel item is gradient and
based on the extent of similarity to prior uses of the construction" (Bybee, 2010, p. 57), and specifically "based on
similarity to frequent, conventionalized sequences"
(Bybee, 2010, p. 59).
Nonetheless, the mechanisms that allow for generalisation remain largely unaddressed by empirical studies.
For example, despite the proposed association between
novel and familiar representations, it is not clear to what

extent the plausibility of novel phrases is modulated by
the degree of semantic relatedness to known multiword
units; or whether, e.g. recent exposure to related conventional items is necessary.
Moreover, our understanding of the temporal dynamics
of the processing of non-conventional multiword units is
surprisingly limited, and is only informed indirectly by previous research. For example, a large body of corpus-based
studies has examined the consequences of linguistic innovation, but this strand of the literature is most concerned
with the consequences of change long after it has been
initiated (e.g. Brown & Cortes-Torres, 2012; Eddington,
2000; Baayen, 2003; Boas, 2003; Bybee & Eddington,
2006). At the same time, experimental research in cognitive
neuroscience has explored the temporal dynamics of
online novel language processing, but this body of work
has focused on creative language, such as metaphors
and similes, which are not interpretable in a literal sense
(in metaphors, e.g. "that lawyer is a shark", "brainwaves
are stethoscopes"). While potentially relevant, it is not yet
clear whether the same mechanisms involved in processing metaphorical language underlie the comprehension
of the type of innovations that are common in everyday
language usage.
Understanding the mechanisms that allow to process
novel input in connection with stored representations in
real time is of high theoretical importance, as it represents
the first step of a process in which novel input is transformed into part of the knowledge network. The
present work seeks to, first, address a gap in the current
literature by examining the processing of novel multiword expressions that are conventional or not based on
usage (as indexed by corpus data) (RQ 1). Secondly,
using behavioural data as well as brain event-related
potentials, this study seeks to provide insights into the
time course of processing of novel utterances and generalisation in comprehension (RQ 2). By analysing judgements of multiword expressions and simultaneously
recorded neurophysiological data, it will examine the
association between ERPs and behavioural judgements.
Finally, an additional goal is to explore whether processing of novel phrases is dependent on the recent activation of the related conventional representations (RQ 3).
The background section that follows will first provide
a brief overview of the role of similarity and analogybased processing in the comprehension of linguistic
innovations; and will also summarise relevant previous
findings on the real-time processing of novel language.

1.1. The role of similarity in linguistic innovation
Previous research on corpus data has indicated that,
even by conservative estimates, a large proportion of

word choices are not made spontaneously but are
instead based on conventionalised multiword units
(ranging from 30% to 80% depending on the method
used and type of corpus analysed; Biber et al., 1999;
Erman & Warren, 2000; Conklin & Schmitt, 2012). This
highlights two important facts about language usage.
On the one hand, speakers rely heavily on previous
experience of conventional language; at the same
time, there is a large proportion of usage that is nonconventional (i.e. it is "novel") from a quantitative perspective. However, considerable previous work indicates
that novel language is still not entirely removed from
prior experience. Rather, evidence indicates that productivity at multiple levels of representation is achieved
by gradually building upon prior experience through
"analogy" (Eddington, 2000; Baayen, 2003; Boas, 2003;
Krott et al., 2001; Bybee & Eddington, 2006).
An important finding of previous corpus work is that
the distributional trends in prior usage may account for
innovative and non-conventional combinations (Boas,
2003; Brown & Cortes-Torres, 2012; Bybee & Eddington,
2006). For example, when an infrequent adjective must
be used, corpus data shows that speakers select one
verb or the other based on the semantic similarity
between the known and novel combinations (Boas,
2003; Brown & Cortes-Torres, 2012; Bybee & Eddington,
2006; Vergara Wilson, 2014). Semantic similarity has
been proposed both to enable generalisations as well
as to constrain them, so that based on older phrases
such as "to drive someone crazy", variations such as
"to drive someone insane/up the wall" are possible,
but "to drive someone intelligent" is not (Boas, 2003).
This basic analogical mechanism has proven to provide
a powerful account for generalisation. Such evidence is
the basis of increasingly influential usage-based
approaches proposing that knowledge of more schematic, abstract representations (i.e. linguistic "constructions") emerges gradually based on generalisations
made on initially limited knowledge of concrete exemplars (Bybee & Eddington, 2006; Goldberg, 2003; Kidd
et al., 2010; Theakston et al., 2015; Tomasello & Brooks,
1999).

1.2. Online processing of novel language
The processing of novel language and meaning composition has also received attention from neuroscience
studies. Much evidence on the time course of meaning
composition has come from MEG experiments, that
examined how words combine to form unique meanings (e.g. red + boat) (Bemis & Pylkkanen, 2011; BlancoElorrieta & Pylkkanen, 2016; Ziegler & Pylkkanen, 2016).
Previous MEG studies have characterised early stages

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

of semantic combination as originating in the left
anterior temporal lobe within a few milliseconds after
stimulus exposure (by the first 400 ms, Bemis & Pylkkanen, 2011). However, as noted by Fritz and Baggio
(2020), there are difficulties in comparing data from
MEG directly with other neurophysiological methods
such as EEG, even when the same paradigm is used.
In an ERP study a paradigm based on previous MEG
research, Fritz and Baggio (2020) investigated meaning
composition in adjective-noun phrases, where the
type of adjective was manipulated. Of relevance to the
questions explored here was the comparison between
semantic (i.e. interpretable) phrases vis-a-vis non-semantic phrases containing nonce-adjectives. The results
showed a composition effect, by which ERPs revealed
a larger positivity after the noun in interpretable trials
(such as "current president" or "former president") relative to non-interpretable trials, which contained either
nonword ("xqprngk president") or non-existing pseudoword adjectives ("tradisk predisent"). The authors
suggested that the posterior positivity, described as a
P600 effect, was indicative of semantic composition in
a post-N400 frame. This proposal seems to fit well with
views of the N400 as an index semantic access, in
which access is modulated based on the preceding
context (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas & Hillyard,
1980, 1984), followed by semantic integration in the
post-N400 time window (although for views of the
N400 as indexing integration see, e.g. Hagoort & van
Berkum, 1481; Van Berkum et al., 1999). The findings of
the study provided insight into the temporal dynamics
of semantic composition in ERP data. One limitation of
this ERP data, however, was the fact that the lack of
interpretability was based on a comparison with
nonce-words, instead of implausible combinations with
real adjectives.
In an ERP study that examined meaning composition
employing only real words, Molinaro and colleagues
(2012) manipulated the likelihood of Spanish noun-
adjective combinations. In their manipulation, they compared "neutral" plausible adjectives (e.g. monstruo solitario "lonely monster") with "anomalous" implausible
combinations (monstruo geografico "geographical
monster"), with the latter eliciting the expected N400
effect; a third condition contained interpretable lowtypicality adjectives (monstruo hermoso "beautiful
monster"). Importantly, while the anomalous adjectives
were implausible, low-typicality adjectives were interpretable, allowing for semantic composition. The
results revealed a late positive component (LPC, 550-
750 ms) over frontal electrodes, which was elicited by
all but the anomalous phrases. The authors suggested
that the LPC reflected successful semantic

653

combinatorics, and indexed meaning combination of
non-anomalous noun-adjective pairs.
One limitation of Molinaro et al.'s (2012) study was
that the materials were not manipulated based on
their degree of conventionality in usage (i.e. corpus
data), nor on the similarity of novel items to conventional phrases. Therefore, the findings cannot speak
directly to the question of how, and to what extent, processing of novel items was facilitated by knowledge of
previous representations, or what other mechanisms
might have played a role. That is, it is yet unclear to
what degree the processing of novel but non-figurative
multiword units relies on similarity to previously
known conventional representations. Examining similarity-based generalisation in literal, rather than metaphorical, language bears important theoretical import
to linguists, as well as cognitive scientists, concerned
with the nature of linguistic generalisations and their
reception in interlocutors who speak the same language.
While the research on novel language processing
using ERPs is still scarce, the extant data is also consistent with findings from another body of literature,
namely, on the processing of non-literal metaphors
(e.g. Coulson & Van Petten, 2002; Jankowiak et al.,
2017, 2021; Lai & Curran, 2013; Regel et al., 2010;
Rutter et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2017a, 2017b; Weiland
et al., 2014).
Studies that examined analogical thinking in metaphor comprehension - while different from the focus
on non-figurative multiword units here - are relevant
to inform the predictions and methods of the present
study. Similar to the findings from adjective-noun
phrases, studies on metaphor processing have reported
an LPC, often observed within 600-800, that has similarly
been suggested to be an important index of semantic
composition during processing of novel language. In
an early study that investigated metaphor processing,
Coulson and Van Petten (2002) found that, relative to
literal items, metaphors elicited an N400 effect (i.e.
indexing costlier word-level semantic access) as well as
a late positive component (LPC) over posterior sites,
which changed polarity (became more negative) over
frontal electrodes. Relevant to the present study is the
fact that the LPC was associated with semantic composition in the novel items ("power is a strong intoxicant"),
relative to literal multiword units ("whiskey is a strong
intoxicant").
Subsequent studies on metaphors that employed
different experimental manipulations have helped
further characterise the functionality of the LPC (e.g. Jankowiak et al., 2017, 2021; Tang et al., 2017a, 2017b;
Weiland et al., 2014). For instance, studies have found
that a LPC is elicited during processing of novel

654

M. F. PULIDO

metaphors (These lobbyists are hyenas) relative to literal
controls (These carnivores are hyenas) (Bambini et al.
2016; Weiland et al., 2014). Importantly, the LPC has
been elicited both in the presence or absence of an
N400, showing that the two components are independent (Bambini et al., 2016). Using source localisation,
Bambini et al. (2016) suggested that the LPC effect was
generated in the right inferior temporal gyrus, which
has been associated with figurative language processing
and the interpretation of alternative meanings (Zempleni et al., 2007).
Taken together, the converging evidence from the
research on semantic composition in literal and nonliteral (i.e. metaphorical) language points at the LPC as
a likely correlate of meaning integration in non-conventional expressions. However, previous work did not
directly investigate the role that the degree of similarity
between novel and conventional expressions plays on
the processing of innovative language. This is the
focus of the experiment reported here.

2. The present study
The goal of the present research is to investigate the role
that prior knowledge of conventional multiword units
plays on the processing of novel language. To do so,
this study employed ERPs to examine the online processing of verb-noun multiword units in which the noun is
either related or unrelated to the noun of conventional
verb-noun collocations. To manipulate the degree of
relatedness between novel and conventional items, a
selected set of verbs in multiword units was employed,
while the nouns in the phrases were selected based on
their (dis)similarity to the familiar verb-noun collocations. For example, given a conventional sentence in
Spanish such as pedir una hamburguesa ("order a hamburguer") or lavar el dinero ("launder the money"),
items containing a semantically related (pedir los carbohidratos "order the carbohydrates"; lavar las ganacias
"launder the profits") or unrelated noun (pedir el
dominio "order the domain"; lavar la concentracion
"launder the concentration") are presented for participants to rate as either acceptable or unacceptable
phrases in their native language; the novel items (e.g.
pedir los carbohidratos, pedir el dominio) differ only in
relatedness, but are matched in their non-conventionality and unpredictability based on corpus statistics (as is
detailed in Section 3.2). A critical aspect of this design
is that, while the degree of relatedness of novel items
will be manipulated, all novel items will be equally
unconventional, based on frequencies from corpus
data. By collecting acceptability ratings concurrently
with EEG data from the same participants, this study

examines the association between neurophysiological
responses and comprehension of novel multiword
units.1.
Furthermore, an additional question of interest, as
mentioned above, is whether the processing of novel
phrases is dependent on the recent activation of the
known base referents to which some novel phrases are
connected. In particular, while there is some evidence
of similarity-based analogy in offline judgements
(Bybee & Eddington, 2006), the claim that novel
language is facilitated by knowledge of related conventional referents has not been directly tested during
online processing. To test this assumption, the experimental design will employ a three-block design, consisting of a first block with novel multiword units (e.g. "order
the carbohydrates"), a second block with related conventional collocations of reference ("order a hamburger"), and a third block in which additional novel
multiword units will be presented after the related collocations appeared in the previous block (e.g. "order the
gluten"; the block order of the items - "order the
gluten/carbohydrates" - will be counterbalanced
across participants). This design will allow to examine
whether online processing of novel multiword units is
facilitated by seeing the related conventional phrase
that serves as a reference ("order a hamburger") relative
to the first block, in which they will be presented in the
absence of a previously activated identifiable referent.
Grounded in the literature reviewed above, the following research questions were formulated, regarding
processing in what concerns both online (ERPs) and
offline measures (acceptability judgements):
RQ 1: How are plausibility judgements of multiword
phrases affected by their status as conventional (i.e. "collocational") or unconventional, based on corpus data?
RQ 2: How is the plausibility of novel phrases affected by
their degree of semantic relatedness to known conventional collocations?
RQ 3: How are plausibility judgements of novel phrases
affected by recent exposure to related phrases?

2.1. Predictions
RQ 1: How are plausibility judgements of multiword
phrases accepted by their status as conventional (i.e. "collocational") or unconventional, based on corpus data? In
behavioural data, there is a clear prediction that collocations should be rated as highly acceptable, given their
conventional status in the language. Additionally,
grounded in previous data from corpus-based studies,
there is a strong prediction that novel related multiword
units will also be judged as acceptable at a significantly

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

higher rate than novel unrelated multiword units.
However, it is not entirely clear to what extent related
but non-conventional items will differ from the conventional items in terms of their acceptability.
In ERPs, the N400 component is expected to be
modulated by the conventional status of collocations.
In familiar collocations (in which the individual words
in the phrase are statistically associated), the verb facilitates (i.e. primes) the processing of the following noun,
modulating the N400 component (Pulido & Dussias,
2020; Pulido, 2021a). Consequently, during processing
of conventional verb-noun collocations (e.g. "order a
hamburger"1) the noun should elicit a reduced N400,
relative to novel items in which the verb cannot facilitate
processing of an unexpected noun that follows (e.g.
"order the leftovers", "order the domain"). Importantly,
because novel related and unrelated items will be
equally unconventional, no modulation of the N400
due to priming is expected (i.e. non-conventional
nouns are by definition unexpected, and will not be
primed by the preceding verb).
RQ 2: How is the plausibility of novel phrases affected by
their degree of semantic relatedness to known conventional collocations?
In behavioural judgements, the degree of similarity
between novel and conventional items is expected to
significantly predict the acceptability rates of individual
items. To address this question, a dedicated analysis
will be performed on behavioural judgements for
novel related and unrelated phrases, to examine the predictive value of semantic relatedness.
Taking direction from previous ERP studies on
meaning composition, it is expected that the LPC component (550-750 ms) will be modulated by the degree
of interpretability of items (Fritz & Baggio, 2020; Molinaro et al., 2012). If the LPC indeed reflects semantic
integration, as has been previously proposed, it should
be elicited by interpretable phrases (Molinaro et al.,
2012); specifically, both conventional collocations and
novel targets (both of which are plausible) should
present the LPC, but no LPC should be found in noninterpretable controls.
Control phrases, which are both unconventional and
uninterpretable, will provide a critical baseline. That is,
relative to collocational targets, an anomalous phrase
such as "control the coffee" should elicit processing
costs associated with two independent sources: (i) it is
unconventional and, therefore, unexpected (eliciting
an N400); (ii) it is implausible, which prevents the semantic integration of the noun following the verb (failing to
elicit an LPC). To summarise, conventional collocations
are expected to present a reduced N400 relative to controls, while all novel phrases and their controls are

655

expected to elicit an N400. Target interpretable
phrases (but not controls) are expected to elicit an LPC
(Fritz & Baggio, 2020; Molinaro et al., 2012)
RQ 3: How are plausibility judgements of novel phrases
affected by recent exposure to related phrases?
Given the lack of data examining this question
directly, it is not clear to what extent the related linguistic representations that facilitate semantic processing of
a novel multiword unit need to be activated, or how
explicit the connection between the novel and known
multiword units needs to be.
Based on previous evidence from studies on longterm semantic priming (Becker et al., 1997; Francken
et al., 2011; Hughes & Whittlesea, 2003; Was et al.,
2019), it was hypothesised that cumulative exposure to
related conventional items in the second block might
modulate processing in the final block. In this scenario,
between-block semantic priming would be in line with
evidence and proposals that greater initial semantic processing demands result in persistent, rather than transient, semantic priming (Becker et al., 1997; Joordens &
Becker, 1997).
Seeing the same or related words in a recent time
lapse is expected to facilitate (i.e. to prime) access to
the meaning of individual words. Based on this, a
reduced N400 to the nouns of novel-related phrases
may be expected in block 3, indexing easier processing
of the individual words, after processing of semantically
related phrases. More important to the question at hand
are potential modulations in later time windows where,
based on the research reviewed, semantic integration is
predicted to occur. If an LPC reflecting semantic integration in novel phrases is elicited, this component
might be modulated in block 3 relative to block 1, indicating greater ease in semantic integration. Alternatively, if semantic integration is effective already in the
initial block, no significant differences in the LPC will
be found between blocks 1 and 3. In any event, the
outcome of ERPs would be expected to mirror the patterns in behavioural data.

3. Materials and methods
3.1. Participants
Twenty-three native speakers of Spanish participated in
the study (13 female, 10 male).2 All participants were
right-handed, reported normal or corrected-to-normal
vision, and had no history of neurological disorders.
The experimental protocol was approved by the university's Internal Review Board. Participants gave informed
consent prior to beginning the study, and were paid

656

M. F. PULIDO

10 USD per hour of participation or per the corresponding fraction of an hour.

3.2. Materials
Three types of materials were created: one base list of
conventional verb-noun phrases (40 items); lists that
contained acceptable verb-noun phrases, consisting of
80 novel-related phrases derived off the first list (referred
to as "targets"); and a final set of 120 novel-unrelated
control items ("control" items).
To create the materials, first, (a) a list of 40 target collocations was created. These were developed based on
twenty initial collocations that were identified, consisting of conventional verb-noun phrases ("pedir una hamburguesa" "order a hamburger"), to which twenty
additional "sister" collocations were added, consisting
of the same verb and a semantically related noun
("pedir una pizza" "order [a] pizza"). Phrases were
defined as collocations based on t-scores  2.0
(Hunston, 2002) calculated with data from the Corpus
del Espanol (Davies, 2016). T-scores were used as they
have been found to avoid inflation in lower-frequency
(i.e. less conventional) collocations, relative to mutual
information scores (for details on these measures see,
e.g. Evert, 2009); t-scores also allowed for comparability
to previous recent work on processing of collocations
behaviourally (e.g. Pulido & Dussias, 2020; Wolter & Gyllstad, 2011, 2013) and with ERPs (Pulido, 2021a). In
addition to the quantitative (corpus-based) approach
implemented here, in terms of their semantics, collocations were phrases containing largely non-figurative
nouns (this is in contrast with idioms, in which referents
are figurative, i.e. in "spill the beans" no beans are spilt,
but a secret is revealed; Howarth, 1998). However, while
the collocations in the materials were selected to have
non-figurative referents, as noted by an anonymous
reviewer, some of the resulting items could be construed
as not being entirely literal; for example, the phrases
such as "lavar el dinero" ("launder the money"), or
"pedir los carbohidratos" ("order the carbohydrates')
would be considered to be less literal than phrases
such as "pedir los restos" ("order the leftovers') or "publicar una frase" ("publish a phrase"). To control for the
potential role of literality on acceptability, materials
were split into four lists and normed by 40 native speakers of Spanish recruited via Prolific (each list was completed by 10 speakers), who were asked to rate the
literality of each phrase in a scale from 1 to 7, while
ignoring other aspects such as familiarity, naturality,
etc. Literality was found to only have a weak-to-moderate correlation with similarity (r = .38, p < .0001); a literality factor is considered in the analysis reported below.

Based on this first list of 40 collocations (a), the rest of
the materials were created, consisting of (b) two sets of
novel target phrases (40 items in each set) and (c)
matched control items for the target collocations and
target novel phrases in the preceding lists (three
control lists of 40 items each). Importantly, unlike the
collocations, novel items and controls were all selected
to have negative t-scores, indicating that they were
unconventional word pairs.
The novel related phrases were formed using the
same verbs as the target collocations (e.g. "pedir" from
"pedir una hamburguesa" "order a hamburger") and
novel nouns that were semantically related to the collocation noun (e.g. based on "hamburger", "leftovers" and
"gluten" were selected for novel list A, and "carbohydrates" and "protein" for novel list B). These formed
novel phrases, which were semantically related to the
base collocation (e.g. "order a hamburger"), but which
were non-conventional phrases, i.e. had negative collocational (t-score) values. Because target and control
lists were based on the same individual words recombined, the individual words of control lists were inherently matched on word properties (frequency and
orthographic length).
Importantly, target novel-related and unrelated controls were matched in that they were all equally unconventional (all had negative collocational strength) but
were designed to systematically differ in the degree of
relatedness of nouns to the base collocations. That is,
they were selected to be equally unconventional -
both in terms of usage (log-transformed phrase frequency) and collocational strength (log-transformed tscores) - while manipulating their semantic relatedness.
This serves the hypothesis that novel phrases with nouns
related to familiar collocations will be acceptable
(despite their novelty), while previous knowledge will
not be generalisable to those with unrelated nouns.
To create control items, the verbs from the target lists
were re-combined with a new noun from the same list
to form unconventional V + NP combinations that were
semantically unrelated to the base collocations. For
example, for the target novel phrase "pedir los restos"
("order the leftovers"), the unrelated control "pedir el
dominio" ("order the domain") was created, in which
"hamburger"-"domain" are unrelated. This way, for each
unconventional but semantically related phrase, a control
V-det-N sequence was created that was both unconventional and semantically unrelated to the base collocation.
The semantic relatedness between the nouns in multiword units was measured through Pointwise Mutual
Information (PMI) scores (Budiu et al., 2007; Bullinaria &
Levy, 2007; Recchia & Jones, 2009). PMI has been shown
to be a valid index of semantic relatedness, and to be

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

even more highly correlated to human judgments than
more computationally intensive measures such as
Latent Semantic Analysis, when based on large corpora
(in a corpus of >400 million words correlations with
human ratings reached up to r = .85; Recchia & Jones,
2009). PMI scores were calculated based on data from
the web-based section of Corpus del Espanol (Davies,
2016), containing over two billion words, allowing to
derive an index of semantic relatedness between the
nouns across lists. PMI scores showed that target items
were semantically similar to the base collocation items,
while unrelated controls were not (mean similarity score
for unrelated items: -2.13; SD: 2.11; mean for related
items: 2.22, SD: 1.62; t(148.14) = -14.66, p < .0001).
Paired sample materials are shown in Table 1; the full
set is available in the Supplementary Materials. Descriptive statistics and p-values for similarity (PMI), collocational strength (t-scores), literality, and log-transformed
V-N phrase frequency are presented in Table S1 of the
Appendix.

3.3. Procedure
Participants gave informed consent after arriving in the
lab. Their linguistic background information was collected through the LEAP-Q (Marian et al., 2007). Participants were set up with an EEG cap and completed a
plausibility judgement task. Completing this procedure
took approximately 1 hour.
The task instructions indicated that participants would
be presented with a series of phrases that would vary with
regard to their familiarity, and it was made clear that familiarity was not the focus of the task. Rather, they should
use a button box to indicate whether they considered
the phrases to be acceptable (right button) or not (left
button). For example, a phrase like "read a poem"
expresses a plausible action and is therefore acceptable,
while a phrase like "compose a sock" would be considered non-sensical and therefore unacceptable. They
were told that many items would fall somewhere in
between these two extremes, and that it was up to
them to judge whether phrases expressed plausible
actions or not. None of the example or practice items
were part of the experimental items.
During the task, phrases were presented one word at
a time in a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm
(RSVP). ERPs were time-locked to the presentation of
the nouns. In each trial, first, a fixation cross was displayed for 700 ms; it was followed by the verb (400
ms), which functioned as the prime for the following
noun (target), and a determiner (250 ms). The target
noun was displayed for 400 ms, followed by a response
screen that was presented up to 6,000 ms or until a

657

response was detected, whichever came first. Participants were instructed to blink during a "blinking
screen" which followed each trial; this served as a
1,100 ms ITI before the beginning of the next trial, in
addition to the following fixation cross screen (700
ms). A sample trial is illustrated in Figure 1.
The task was divided into three blocks which, based
on the research questions and the goals described
above, were made so that Block 1 contained half of
the novel items (before participants saw any of the
related collocations); Block 2 contained the conventional
collocations; finally, in Block 3, participants saw the other
half of the novel items related to the collocations in
Block 2.
To avoid any potential effects of specific novel items
displayed in Blocks 1 and 3, two versions of the materials
were used. Novel list A, containing half of the novel
items, was presented in Block 1 for about half of the participants (11/23, 48%), with the other half appearing in
Block 3; and Novel list B was presented first in the
other half (12/23, 52%). This ensured that grand ERP
averages contained the same novel items before and
after the collocations were seen (Block 1 vs Block 3).
Within each block, for target items that shared the
same verb (recall that each verb appeared twice within
each list, e.g. "order the leftovers / order the gluten"),
the second item was not repeated until all other verbs
had appeared in that block; which of the two items
appeared first in the block was also counterbalanced
across participants. Finally, in order to minimise repetition effects between nouns that appeared in both
targets and controls, the control items were randomised
across all three blocks of the experiment, so that the
controls for novel items in a given block (e.g. the first
block) were distributed across the three experimental
blocks.

3.4. Analysis
3.4.1. Behavioural data
Acceptability judgements from behavioural responses
were analysed using generalised linear mixed-effects
modelling, implemented through the lme4 package
(version 1.1.26; Bates et al., 2007) in R (v. 4.0.2, R Core
Team). To address research questions 1-2, two separate
analyses were performed: a model including all items, to
address question 1; and a dedicated model including the
effect of similarity in all novel items and their controls, to
address question 2.
In a first analysis that followed a factorial approach,
models were created to consider the effects of fixed
terms: experimental Block (1: novel items; 2: collocations;
3: novel items) and item Type (targets vs controls), and

their interaction, as well as Collocational strength and
Trial number. This allowed to examine the effect of collocation status of targets (novel phrases in blocks 1 and
3, collocations in block 2), as well as the effect of performing judgements before or after being exposed to
the familiar collocations. Random effects structures

were maximally specified initially (Barr et al., 2013) but
following attempts that led to overfitting they were simplified. The full final models selected are reported in the
Supplementary Materials. The initial maximal randomeffects structure included by-subject random slopes for
Block and Type, and by-item random slopes for Trial

number. Because the semantic similarity measure only
applied to the novel items and controls, but not to the
collocations, this variable was included in a dedicated
analysis. Additionally, a literality factor was also
included,3 as well as an interaction between similarity
and literality, to control for the possibility that similarity
might differently affect phrases rated as literal and nonliteral. A backward step-by-step selection procedure was
followed, in which one variable was removed at a time
and kept only if it significantly improved the model fit
(likelihood ratio test p < .05). Continuous predictors
were centred, and discrete variables were sum-to-zero
contrast coded. Pairwise comparisons for the fixed
terms in the selected fit model were performed using
the emmeans package in R (v. 1.5.0; Lenth & Lenth,
2018). When reporting the output of the pairwise comparisons,  estimate values reflect log odds ratios,
rather than the scaled response measure.
To address research question 2, the second dedicated
analysis was performed using the same model selection
procedure, including the novel collocational items and
their controls, while excluding the collocations. This
second model tested for the effects of the critical variable of Similarity between the novel items and the collocations, while controlling for Collocational strength and
Literality. For this second dedicated analysis, the initial
random effects structure considered by-subject slopes
for Block, Similarity and Collocational strength, and byitem slopes for item Order.
The analysis of RTs was conducted employing linear
mixed-effects modelling on the whole dataset, following
the same procedure as described for the generalised
linear mixed-effects model on judgements. Final
models are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

3.4.2. EEG recording and analysis
The continuous electroencephalogram signal (EEG) was
acquired from 32 electrodes mounted in an elastic cap
(EasyCap; Brain Products, GmbH) and using an ActiChamp amplifier (Brain Products, GmbH) with a 24-bit
analogue to digital conversion (online sampling rate:
500 Hz; 0.01-100 Hz band-pass filter). Impedances
were kept below 5 K. Grounding electrodes were
mounted on the forehead and beneath the right eye,
and electrodes were referenced to the right mastoid
online and re-referenced offline to the average of both
mastoids. Data pre-processing steps were implemented
using ERPLAB (Lopez-Calderon & Luck, 2014). Data were
filtered offline with a 25 Hz low pass and 0.1 Hz high pass
noncausal IIR Butterworth digital filter. During pre-processing, manual rejection of excessive muscular artefacts
(EMG) was performed through visual inspection of the
continuous EEG data, while being blind to the

659

experimental conditions; these included sudden
voltage deflections consistent with EMG or of
unknown origin, which could not be attributed to
blinks, saccades or slow-drift skin potentials. Independent component analysis (ICA) was then performed to
correct remaining ocular artefacts (Jung et al., 2000).
The number of components rejected averaged 2.21
(range: 1-3). Epochs with activity exceeding 100 V
at any electrode site were automatically removed
using a peak-to-peak moving window. This resulted in
loss of 4.45% of the data. Epochs ranging from -200
to 1000 ms after onset of the noun were extracted. Baseline correction was done relative to pre-stimulus activity.
Based on the predictions discussed above, the analysis of the EEG data focused on the canonical N400
window (300-500 ms), and the LPC window (550-750
ms) identified in studies on novel phrase processing
review above. Average RTs for button presses did not
overlap with these time windows (mean RT: 1327 ms;
SD: 752); in fact, responses were made after the time
windows of interest in the vast majority of trials (with
only 12% of responses recorded before 750 ms; over
99% of responses were made after 500 ms).
Repeated measures ANOVA were performed for the
regions of interest, with mean amplitudes as dependent
variables, and Block (block 1, 2, 3) and item Type (target,
control) as independent variables. To examine the effect
of the experimental conditions on the dorsal electrodes
(Fz, Cz and Pz) Midline ANOVAs were performed including
Frontality as a predictor (frontal, central, parietal). Lateralised ANOVAs were performed to consider potential differences in ERP activity across groups of electrodes; these and
included Frontality and Hemisphere (left, right) as predictors, and were conducted on F3, F4, F7, F8, FC1, FC2,
FC5, FC6, C3, C4, CP1, CP2, CP5, CP6, P3, P4, P7, P8. This
approach allowed for a topographic description of the
effects (see similar analytical procedures in e.g. Molinaro
et al., 2012). Where sphericity violations were found, Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected values are reported. With the goal
of better characterising the topography of the effects, posthoc pairwise t-tests were performed on each scalp region
(right frontal: F4, F8, FC2, FC6; left frontal: F3, F7, FC1,
FC5; right posterior: CP2, CP6, P4, P8; left posterior: CP1,
CP5, P3, P7); the resulting p-values are FDR-corrected.

4. Results
4.1. Behavioural data: acceptability judgements
To remind the reader, the first RQ asked how plausibility
judgements of multiword phrases would be accepted
based on their status as conventional (i.e. "collocational")
or unconventional, as determined by corpus data (see

660

M. F. PULIDO

Methods). It was predicted that collocations should be
rated as highly acceptable, based on their conventional
status in the language. As for novel items, it was
expected that the degree of similarity between novel
and conventional items would predict the acceptability
rates. The results of the generalised linear mixedeffects regression revealed main effects of Collocational
strength, such that an increase in t-scores led to higher
acceptability (: 0.32, SE: 0.15, p < .05), in line with the
first prediction; and Type of item, such that targets
were significantly more acceptable than controls (:
1.62, SE: 0.13, p < .0001), as predicted for novel items.
Furthermore, RQ 3 asked whether the plausibility judgements of novel phrases would be affected by recent
exposure to related phrases. To test this idea, recall
that novel multiword units were presented before
(Block 1) or after (Block 3) the related conventional collocations (Block 2). The results revealed also a significant
interaction of Type and Block. Pairwise comparisons
computed with the emmeans package indicated that
novel related multiword units presented in Block 1
were rated as acceptable at a significantly lower rate
than the conventional collocations (Block 2) (: -2.27,
SE: 0.42, p < .0001); similarly, the novel related items in
Block 3 had lower rating than the collocations (:
-2.30, SE: 0.42, p < .0001). However, being exposed to
the semantically related collocation did not significantly
affect the behavioural responses, as acceptability rates
were not different for novel items in Block 1 and Block
3 (: -0.04, SE: 0.12, p = .99). At the same time, novel
multiword units were rated as acceptable more often
than their respective controls (Block 1: : 2.55, SE: 0.29,
p < .0001; Block 3: : 2.52, SE: 0.29, p < .0001). The baseline control items for the different lists did not significantly differ from each other (all ps > .40). The mean

acceptability rates for each condition and block are
shown in Figure 2. Additional details are provided in
Table S2 of the Appendix.
In the dedicated analysis - which was performed on
novel multiword units and their controls to further examined the effect of similarity - the effect of similarity to
conventional collocations emerged as highly significant
(: 0.50, SE: 0.13, p < .0001). There was also a significant
effect of literality (: 1.09, SE: 0.13, p < .0001). Importantly, no interaction between similarity and literality
was found, indicating that the effect of similarity did
not differ for high- and low-literality items. The effect
of Block was non-significant for novel items in the dedicated analysis (in line with the lack of differences
between Blocks 1 and 3 in the general analysis), and
was not selected in the best-fitting model. Other variables considered were non-significant. Figure 3 illustrates the effect of similarity on the average
acceptability for each item. Items with more extreme
similarity scores (z-scores greater than  2.5) were
checked and found to not be overly influential; the
difference in fits was calculated (i.e. the scaled difference
between the ith fitted value obtained from the full data
and the corresponding fitted value obtained by deleting
the ith observation; Welsch & Kuh, 1977) and all values
were found to be < .20. Altogether, the pattern of
results from acceptability judgements aligned with the
hypotheses at the behavioural level.

4.2. RT data
The results of linear mixed-effects analysis indicated a
main effect of Trial on RTs, with faster responses as the
experiment advanced (: 105.53, SE: 26.98, p < .001).
There was a main effect of Block, such that the target

collocations presented in Block 2 had faster RTs than the
novel items in both Blocks 1 (: 68.39, SE: 15.17, p
< .0001) and 3 (: 71.91, SE: 15.24, p < .0001). There was
also a significant effect of Type (: 52.84, SE: 17.61, p
< .01) and an interaction of Type x Block (: 78.95, SE:
15.15, p < .0001). Follow-up comparisons were performed with the emmeans package to further examine
this interaction. Similar to the acceptability results, comparisons showed that, while novel items differed from
collocations presented in Block 2, novel targets presented in Block 1 and Block 3 did not differ from each
other (: 60.82, SE: 40.3, p = .66), suggesting that processing of novel items was not significantly impacted by
recent exposure to the related conventional collocations. Further, pairwise comparisons revealed that only
RTs for collocations differed from their controls (:
204.87, SE: 49.5, p < .0001) but, importantly, target
novel items in Blocks 1 and Block 3 did not differ from
their respective controls (Block 1: : -64.37, SE: 46.6, p
= .74; Block 3: : 52.22, SE: 46.2, p = .87). In short, collocations elicited faster RTs than all other item categories,
while the other categories did not differ from one
another. Importantly, there was no significant difference
between the novel controls and novel targets that are
the basis for the LPC effect reported here.

4.3. ERP results
4.3.1. N400 time window (300-500 ms)
As discussed in the introduction, N400 modulations
were expected based on the conventional status of

collocations relative to controls. The results of the
midline repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant
effects of Block (F (2, 44) = 3.26, p < .05,  2 = .009), item
Type (F (1, 22) = 29.07, p < .0001,  2 = .03) and Frontality
(F (1.31, 28.88) = 21.49, p < .0001,  2 = .11), as well as significant interactions between Block x Type (F (2, 44) =
6.02, p < .01,  2 = .02), Block x Frontality (F (2.24, 49.17)
= 4.29, p < .05,  2 = .002), Type x Frontality (F (1.17,
25.67) = 4.29, p < .05,  2 = .0006), and a three way interaction of Block x Type x Frontality (F (2.59, 57) = 3.19,
p < .05,  2 = .001).
The results of the lateralised ANOVA revealed significant effects of item Type (F (1, 22) = 26.24, p < .0001,
 2 = .028) and Frontality (F (1.27, 27.93) = 20.4, p
< .0001,  2 = .09). There were also significant two-way
interactions between Block and Type (F (2, 44) = 5.57,
p < .01,  2 = .019), Block and Frontality (F (2.2, 48.37) =
4.75, p < .05,  2 = .002), Type and Hemisphere (F (1, 22)
= 15.47, p < .001,  2 = .0008); as well as a three-way interaction between Block, Hemisphere and Frontality (F (4,
88) = 5.73, p < .0001,  2 = .0002).
Recall that, for target novel items, no modulation of
the N400 was expected relative to unrelated controls,
given that both novel target and control items will be
equally unconventional (i.e. unpredictable based on
the preceding word); however, novel targets in Block 3
might exhibit a reduced N400, indexing easier processing after processing of semantically related phrases in
Block 2. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons indicated no significant differences between target novel collocations in
Block 1 and their controls; in contrast, there were

662

M. F. PULIDO

significant differences between target collocations and
their controls, as well as between novel collocations presented in Block 3 and their respective controls, for all
midline electrodes and electrode regions, maximal at
posterior sites (p-values < .001).
Additionally, there were significant differences
between novel targets presented in Block 1 and collocations, maximal at posterior electrodes (all p-values < .01).
In contrast, the comparison between novel items in
Block 3 and collocations was non-significant at frontal
sites (p-values > .40) but was significant at Pz over the
midline (t (22) = -2.97, p < .05), and over left-posterior
(t (91) = -5.15, p < .0001) than right-posterior electrodes
(t (91) = -3.53, p < .01).
Finally, novel multiword units presented in Blocks 1
and 3 (i.e. before and after seeing the related collocations)
did not differ at the frontal midline (t(22) = -1.58, p = .24)

but showed significant differences in both hemispheres
at posterior electrodes (all ps < .01). The significant
differences between targets and their controls are illustrated in Figure 4, and Figure 5 illustrates the significant
differences between the different types of target items.

4.3.2. LPC time-window (550-750 ms)
Based on the literature reviewed above, it was
hypothesised that effective semantic integration of
novel multiword units might occur either in the
absence of priming (Block 1) and/or after recent
exposure to related collocations (Block 3). The analysis
of the LPC time-window allowed to address this question by examining modulations of the LPC (or their
absence) across blocks. In the time-window spanning
from 550 to 750 ms, the midline ANOVA indicated significant effects of Block (F (2, 44) = 6.76, p < .01,

Figure 4. Grand averages for control and target items divided by block. Scalp plots show the amplitude difference (control - target)
for the 300-500 ms (N400 effect) and the 550-750 ms (LPC effect) time-windows. Negativity is plotted up.

 2 = .007), Type and Frontality (F (1.2, 26.4) = 5.2, p
< .05,  2 = .001), and Block, Type and Frontality (F (2.30,
50.61) = 12.37, p < .0001,  2 = .006).
In the lateralised ANOVA, significant effects emerged
for Block (F (2, 44) = 6.68, p < .01,  2 = .02) and Type (F (1,
22) = 29.81, p < .0001,  2 = .057); as well as two-way
interactions for Type x Hemisphere (F (1, 22) = 73.08, p
< .0001,  2 = .008), Block x Frontality (F (2.07, 45.5) =
15.02, p < .0001,  2 = .006), Type x Frontality (F = (1.19,
26.22) = 4.11, p < .05,  2 = .001) and Hemisphere x Frontality (F (2, 44) = 21.73, p < .0001,  2 = .009); three-way
interactions for Block x Type x Frontality (F (2.22,
48.93) = 11.64, p < .0001,  2 = .005), Block x Hemisphere
x Frontality (F (4, 88) = 5.93, p < .001,  2 = .0002); Type x
Hemisphere x Frontality (F (2, 44) = 22.99, p < .0001,
 2 = .001); and a four-way interaction between Block x
Type x Hemisphere x Frontality (F (2.89, 63.54) = 9.55,
p < .0001,  2 = .0004).
Follow-up post-hoc comparisons indicated that novel
multiword units presented in Block 1 differed from controls at frontal regions (all p-values < .001) but only marginally at Cz (p = .06) and did not significantly differ at
right and midline posterior sites (all ps > .73). However,
novel items presented in Block 3 differed from their controls at all sites (all ps < .001). As for collocations, differences with their respective controls were broadly

distributed (all ps < .001) but marginal at Fz (t (22) =
2.11, p = .07) and absent at left frontal electrodes (t
(91) = 0.59, p = .60).
Beyond controls, comparisons of target items showed
differences between Block 1 novel items and collocations at central and posterior electrodes (ps < .01), but
not over frontal electrodes (ps > .19). Similarly, novel
items presented in Block 3 were significantly different
from collocations at parietal electrodes as well as over
left frontal electrodes (all ps < .05), but not at the
midline and right frontal regions. Novel multiword
units presented during Block 1 and Block 3 significantly
differed only at posterior electrodes (all ps < .01) and not
over frontal electrodes.

4.3.3. Dedicated analysis on the effect of time on
target items
While novel items were presented to participants in
Blocks 1 and 3 in a counterbalanced fashion, a simple
between-block comparison does not control for the
effect of time within the experiment. Therefore, a
linear mixed-effects regression was performed on the
target items to assess whether differences in the N400
amplitude of novel targets in Block 3 (relative to Block
1) were due to (a) exposure to related collocations in
Block 2; or (b) whether the attenuated N400 in Block 3
might just reflect an effect of "time", reflecting cumulative semantic priming on individual words, rather than an
effect on processing novel multiword units.4 The

664

M. F. PULIDO

dependent variable was the N400 amplitude at the posterior electrodes that revealed between-block differences (i.e. the left and right posterior regions and Pz).
The model allowed to examine the effect of time (i.e.
Trial Order) as a continuous predictor based on the
order of presentation of items for each participant, in
addition to the effect of Block (1, 2 or 3); random intercepts for subjects and items were included. The results
indicated a significant effect of Trial Order ( = 0.19, SE
= 0.041, p < .0001). Relative to the first block, there was
a significant effect for collocations in Block 2 ( = 0.75,
SE = 0.18, p < .0001) but, importantly, there was no significant difference for novel items in Block 3 ( = 0.17,
SE = 0.10, p = .11), indicating that variability in the
N400 of Block 3 was accounted for by the effect of
Trial Order alone.

4.3.4. Correlational analysis between behavioural
judgements and ERPs
Finally, after performing the analyses related to the
research questions, an exploratory correlational analysis
was conducted with the aim of investigating the connection between neurophysiological responses and behaviour. The assumption in examining ERP effects is that
the modulations in brain waves reflect the effect of processing interpretable novel phrases, relative to controls,
within each individual. While a critical assumption, no
previous ERP studies examining processing of non-conventional language seemed to have investigated the
association of acceptability rates and ERP modulations.
Evidence of this correlation would provide further
support to an interpretation of a given component as
reflective of analogy-based generalisation. Importantly,
because processing of conventional collocations is also
known to be affected by familiarity, the correlational
analysis focuses on novel targets and controls, which
were matched on their phrase frequency and (non)conventionality.
To investigate this idea, two steps were taken. First,
the neural correlates of behaviour should, of course,
exhibit at least the same significant differences (or
absence thereof) as the results of acceptability judgements, as illustrated in Figure 2. That is, plausible electrode regions of interest might show a pattern in ERPs
that matches the behavioural pattern: (i) Target items
should differ from controls; at the same time, (ii) target
items in Blocks 1 and 3 should not differ among each
other. Based on the results of the ERP analysis reported
in the previous section, this pattern was only matched
by the LPC during the 550-750 ms, and particularly at
right frontal electrodes.
Secondly, once the target component and electrode
region were identified, the correlational analysis was

conducted based on each participant's average mean
ERP amplitude in the 550-750 time-window and individual participants' acceptability ratings per condition.
Given that the correlation included repeated measures
(i.e. it included each participant's mean for targets in a
given block as well as their mean for controls), a
repeated measures correlational analysis was performed
with the rmcorr package (Bakdash & Marusich, 2017)5;
while common correlation techniques (e.g. Pearson,
Kendall, Spearman) assume independent observations,
repeated measures correlation (Bland & Altman, 1995a,
1995b) evaluates the intra-individual association
between two measures, and provides the best linear fit
for each participant. While the prediction was stronger
for the right frontal region, comparisons were also considered for amplitudes from the left frontal region, as
well as right and left posterior regions. The resulting
FDR-corrected p-values revealed a significant positive
correlation between the mean amplitudes in the right
frontal region (550-750 ms) and behavioural judgements for both the first block (rrm = .70, p < .001) and
the last block (rrm = .76, p < .0001), as illustrated in
Figure 6; over left frontal electrodes, the correlation
reached significance (block 1: rrm = .46, p < .05; block 3:
rrm = .44, p < .05). Over parietal electrodes, results were
non-significant for block 1 (all p values > .09); they
were significant for block 3 for the other electrode
regions (right posterior rrm = .73, p < .001; left posterior:
rrm = .58 p < .01).
In summary, the correlational analyses showed that
only voltages in the right frontal region were consistently correlated with behavioural responses across the
experiment. This finding helps define the topography
of the neural correlates of analogy-based generalisation,
suggesting that the right frontal effect observed in the
550-750 ms window (LPC) plays a role in the integration
of novel representations.

4.3.5. Post-hoc analysis of early time window
While the hypotheses formulated above were guided by
previous work in this area that examined modulations of
the N400 and LPC components, these components analyzed here reflect relatively late processes. Other ERP
work has indicated that the semantic context may
influence linguistic processes already within the first
200 ms following the onset of the critical word stimulus
(e.g. Penolazzi et al., 2007), and at least one study found
evidence of early modulations during processing of multiword units (by 250 ms; Tremblay & Baayen, 2010). To
examine this possibility, an exploratory post-hoc analysis
of timepoint-by-timepoint modulations between 100
and 250 ms was conducted for each of the three
blocks. A mass-univariate analysis was performed with

procedure for control of the false discovery rate (FDR)
was applied to assess the significance of each test
using an FDR level of 5%. However, no significant differences between targets and controls were detected at
any time point, indicating no modulations before 300-
500 ms.

5. Discussion
Previous work has provided compelling evidence for a
role of analogy in linguistic innovation (e.g. Boas, 2003;
Brown & Cortes-Torres, 2012; Bybee & Eddington, 2006;
Goldberg, 2006). However, there is a lack of psycholinguistic research examining how novel language is processed by native speakers (with the exception of work
on metaphors, e.g. Arzouan et al., 2007; Coulson & Van
Petten, 2002; Tang et al., 2017). The present study investigated the processing of novel multiword units that
differed systematically in their relatedness to previous
linguistic representations. By systematically manipulating the relatedness and conventionality of multiword
units based on corpus data, the experiment reported
produced a number of novel results derived from behavioural and ERP data. These are discussed in turn.

5.1. Acceptability judgements (behavioural data)
The design employed here, in which novel multiword
units were presented before or after a block containing
related conventional collocations, allowed to address
the first three research questions based on behavioural
data. Research question 1 asked how plausibility judgements of multiword phrases were affected by their

collocational status. Based on previous work, there was
a strong expectation that the conventionality (i.e. "collocational status") of multiword units would elicit high
acceptability rates relative to non-conventional multiword units. This was indeed the case, with conventional
multiword units averaging 93% acceptability, while
related non-conventional units averaged 63% acceptability (mean acceptability for controls was 25%). While
this result was expected, a key question concerned to
what extent the plausibility of novel phrases was predicted by their degree of semantic relatedness to
known conventional collocations (RQ 2). The results
revealed a highly significant effect of similarity, indicating that the acceptability rates of novel multiword
units were in fact predicted by the degree of semantic
relatedness of novel items with familiar (i.e. collocational) multiword units. Additionally, literality did help
account for additional variation, with higher literality
predicting higher acceptability rates. But, importantly,
literality did not interact with similarity, indicating that
there were no differences in the effect of similarity
among more and less literal items. In short, the behavioural results of the judgement task revealed that nonconventional multiword units are acceptable to speakers
to the extent to which units are semantically related to a
previously known (i.e. conventional) collocation, revealing a gradient effect of the similarity between old and
novel units (illustrated in Figure 3).
Further, a question addressed by the behavioural
data was how the plausibility judgements of novel
phrases would be affected by recent exposure to
related familiar phrases. Recall that novel items were
counterbalanced across participants, in order to
examine how the processing of novel items was
affected by being previously exposed (or not) to a

666

M. F. PULIDO

related conventional collocation. The results of the initial
block showed that, even in the absence of other facilitatory cues - such as the related collocation - novel items
related to collocations were recognised as largely acceptable (63%), while unrelated controls were not (reaching
only 25% acceptability on average). The data from the
third block allowed to address this question directly.
The results of judgements in a final block showed that
acceptability rates did not differ - and were in fact
remarkably stable - even after participants had been
exposed to the associated conventional collocations
during the preceding block. That is, the comparison of
judgements in the first and third block provided compelling evidence that, while the relatedness of novel multiword units to known collocations was an important
condition for the acceptability of novel items, this association did not need to be made explicit or facilitated in
any way. In fact, seeing the related collocations in
Block 2 produced no effect in participants' judgements
during Block 3. Based on this, the behavioural data
would thus seem to suggest that similarity might
operate at an implicit level, without the need for participants to be explicitly aware of the connection between
novel multiword units and prior linguistic
representations.

5.2. Online processing of novel and conventional
items
The results of the ERP analysis provided additional
insights into the time course of processing of novel multiword units. One overarching question concerns how
the processing of conventional items differs from the
processing of novel items. Based on previous studies,
the ERP analysis focused on the N400 component, as a
correlate of semantic access/integration; and the LPC,
believed to index post-lexical integration. In the
present paradigm, a clear prediction was made by
which effects of individual words - i.e. priming effects -
would result in modulations of the N400; while integration costs associated with the meaning of the
whole multiword unit would modulate the LPC. That is,
because a noun becomes more expected when it is
part of a conventional phrase, the collocations presented in Block 2 were predicted to elicit an attenuated
N400 relative to controls. This is in line with previous ERP
studies on collocational priming, where the first word in
the phrase (e.g. the verb) acts as a prime, facilitating processing of the following word (Pulido & Dussias, 2019;
Pulido, 2021a; Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2017). As predicted, the ERPs showed that relative to non-conventional multiword units, which elicited an increased
N400, conventional collocations produced a reduced

negativity component within the same time window.
That is, the N400 was sensitive to the expectedness of
the nouns in conventional phrases based on the experimental manipulation.
When considering the data from the initial block,
which contained novel related and unrelated multiword
units, no N400 modulation was observed. Importantly, in
Block 1 novel targets and controls were equally unexpected, but nouns in novel targets were easier to integrate relative to implausible controls, as indicated by
behavioural data. That is, consistent with the view that
the N400 reflects predictability based on the preceding
context (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas & Hillyard,
1980, 1984), no differences should emerge between
the two sets of equally unexpected multiword units
(i.e. novel targets and novel controls). This prediction
was supported by the data.
On the other hand, couched within the view of the
LPC as an indicator of ease of integration (Brouwer
et al., 2012; Juottonen et al., 1996; Neville et al., 1993),
differences should subsequently be observed between
novel related and controls. This was indeed the case.
The present pattern of results therefore characterised
the time-course of novel multiword processing in a
manner consistent with previous findings. The ERP
data suggests that there is an initial cost in lexical
access upon first encountering a novel multiword unit
(N400 time window), regardless of its plausibility.
During subsequent post-lexical processing (LPC time
window) novel expressions are evaluated against the
existing lexical networks (which includes familiar multiword units). As the results showed, higher similarity
between known and novel expressions resulted in an
enhanced LPC effect.5.
Altogether, the results support a two-step view of
multiword processing, in which first the N400 is modulated by context expectancy based on prior lexical representations (at the word and multiword level), which
facilitate (or not) lexical access (Kutas & Federmeier,
2011; Kutas & Hillyard, 1980, 1984); the data add to
prior evidence that, following the N400 time window,
semantic integration of phrasal meanings is reflected
in the LPC window (Fritz & Baggio, 2020; Molinaro
et al., 2012).

5.2.1. The LPC indexes semantic integration of
novel input "on the fly"
An important research goal was to examine how the
real-time processing of novel phrases was affected by
their relatedness to familiar collocations, as reflected in
neurophysiological responses (RQ 2). This idea was
grounded in the proposal of usage-based approaches
that similarity between novel and previously known

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

multiword units drives acceptability (e.g. Bybee, 2010;
Bybee & Eddington, 2006). Recall that, in contrast with
previous studies on metaphor processing, in which conditions differed both in their conventionality and ease of
interpretation, the design employed here matched all
novel items (targets and controls) in unconventionality,
while manipulating their degree of relatedness to familiar representations. This way, the design allowed to
examine modulations in components related to semantic integration only. The results of the ERP analysis identified this component as an isolated LPC, which emerged
in the absence of an N400 (Block 1); that is, relative to
controls, processing of the novel multiword units presented in Block 1 elicited an isolated LPC over rightfrontal electrodes. This way, the results replicate previous data showing that the LPC can be elicited independently from the N400 (i.e. in the results of Block 1). The
LPC and its scalp distribution is also congruent with
the results reported by Molinaro and colleagues (2012),
in perhaps the most directly comparable previous study.
Was similarity, then, responsible for modulations in
the online processing of novel phrases, beyond behavioural responses of acceptability? The finding that the
relatedness manipulation elicited an isolated LPC indicated that similarity did in fact modulate online processing. The modulations in the LPC, which was significantly
more negative only in uninterpretable controls (e.g.
"order the domain") that were rated as implausible,
allowed to establish a correspondence between ERPs
and acceptability ratings. Importantly, this interpretation
was corroborated by the follow-up correlational analysis.
The repeated measures correlation tested the idea that
more positive LPC amplitudes would be associated
with greater acceptability rates for an individual participant, while more negative waves would be correlated
with lower ratings. The results showed a moderate-tostrong, highly significant positive correlation, indicating
a direct association between individual participants' LPC
amplitudes and their individual acceptability of novel
items. The finding provided clear evidence of the LPC
as a correlate of processing costs associated with
forming meaning representations that require integration of the elements in a multiword unit. The association between the LPC component and acceptability in
ratings seems to provide neurophysiological evidence
for a semantic integration mechanism "on the fly".
This pattern of results fits well within usage-based
accounts that posit a preeminent role of prior linguistic
experience in how incoming input is processed and integrated (or not) within existing lexico-semantic representations. The finding that novel but similar phrases
elicited both an enhanced LPC and higher acceptability
provides strong support to the role of similarity posited

667

by usage-based linguists. In these accounts, similarity
provides a mechanism for the system to grow and to
incorporate novel input based on pre-existing representations. The present study provides a first step in the
empirical exploration of the idea that semantic integration of novel phrases impacts processing in the
short-term. Additionally, the findings provide a potential
gateway for the integration of novel input in long-term
representations, which would allow the linguistic
system to grow, one phrase at a time, through the
exploitation of the two aspects manipulated here:
partial lexico-syntactic overlap (through the shared
verb in known and novel units) and similarity of the
non-overlapping material to previous representations.
It should be noted that there are some differences
among previous ERP studies that examined the processing of novel language, and also with the present
study. For example, Jankowiak et al. (2021) reported an
LPC during processing of metaphors in short sentences
(e.g. "Love is a monastery") that included a finite verb
form, whereas the present study employed non-finite
phrases ("order the carbohydrates"). As a reviewer
noted, the LPC is typically reported during sentence
reading, and the proposed interpretation of the LPC in
the present results should be further validated. At least
one other ERP study that examined semantic composition employed determiner-adjective-noun phrases
with no verbs (Fritz & Baggio, 2020). The authors found
a slightly earlier effect (450-700 ms) with a posterior distribution, which was interpreted as a P600 elicited by the
processing of verb-less phrases. Given the novelty of the
present results, further data will be needed to better
understand the sources of variability in timing and
scalp topography of the functionally related neurophysiological responses reported to date.

5.2.2. The effect of prior exposure to conventional
collocations
The data from Block 3 allowed to address an additional
research question: How is the real-time processing of
novel phrases affected by the recency in activation of
familiar collocations? (RQ 3).
First, the results of the ERP analysis revealed an attenuated N400 in Block 3; however, this reduced amplitude was accounted for by the effect of time (i.e. trial
order). Importantly, the N400 in Block 3 was still significantly more negative than for the conventional collocations in Block 2, indicating no significant differences
between Block 3 and Block 1, after accounting for the
effect of time.
More relevant to the question of semantic integration
was the finding that the LPC amplitudes in the final
block did not significantly differ from those in the first

668

M. F. PULIDO

block; in other words, while the N400 was modulated in
processing novel items in Block 3 relative to Block 1, the
LPC did not show significant differences. This lack of
differences in the LPC would seem to indicate that
exposure to the conventional collocations in the prior
block did not affect how well the novel-related items
could be comprehended in the final block. Remarkably,
this pattern mirrored the ratings for acceptability,
which indicated that novel-related items were not considered more acceptable even after participants were
exposed to related items that likely made them more
predictable. Therefore, to conclude, based on the
pattern of results reported, a tentative answer to this
question is that prior exposure to the related conventional collocations was not necessary, nor did appear
to influence, processing of the novel target items at
the behavioural nor at the neurophysiological level.
Because the present data allow to address this question
for the first time, to the best of the author's knowledge,
additional research will be needed to further test this
interpretation.

5.2.3. Future directions and limitations
The current work presents one of the first attempts to
investigate processing of non-conventional multiword
units (although see e.g. Bybee & Eddington, 2006, for
evidence from acceptability judgements) and to investigate generalisation based on similarity. Future work may
explore alternative empirical operationalisations of similarity, as well as consider other types of semantic association (such as hypernymy, hyponymy, metonymy, etc.)
and language-specific semantic categories.
The results reported shed light on the question of
generalisation of multiword units, but some questions
remain. For instance, even though the present data
revealed a highly significant effect of similarity (and literality), there was still unexplained variation in the
behavioural and ERP responses to the items tested, as
would be expected. Future work will be needed to identify additional factors that may have modulated processing in the present data. A possible source of variation
in the data may be related to other associations within
the lexicon. In the present approach, novel items were
assessed in terms of their similarity to one familiar collocation. It is certainly possible that a novel item may have
been dissimilar to the base collocation used as reference,
but perhaps similar to other collocations. Although there
is no simple solution to this issue, more computationally
intensive approaches may allow to compare a novel
item to a broader network of collocations, situating it
within a larger multiword inventory. While these ideas
go beyond the goals and the present work, they open
up interesting avenues to be explored in future studies.

6. Conclusion
The present study shed light on processing of non-conventional multiword units, which were manipulated with
regards to their similarity to conventional collocations.
The results of behavioural judgements and ERPs
showed that, even in the absence of any overt cues, processing of novel multiword units was automatically
facilitated through implicit intra-lexical associations to
prior representations. Following exposure to a block
containing familiar collocations, the results showed not
modulation in acceptability ratings or ERPs; i.e. results
did not differ between Blocks 1 and 3, indicating that
novel multiword units are accepted based on similarity
to previously known units, even in the absence of a facilitatory context. The ERP results identified the LPC (elicited between 550 and 750 ms) as a
neurophysiological correlate of semantic integration in
multiword units. The LPC was not only modulated by
similarity to previously known collocations but, importantly, was shown to be significantly correlated with
acceptability rates. Altogether, the findings help
expand our the currently limited understanding of
how prior linguistic experience influences the temporal
dynamics of processing novel multiword units.

Notes
1. As one of the first approximations to the processing of
novel multiword units, the present study examined processing when novel phrases are presented in isolation.
This type of decontextualization is a common approach
in the psycholinguistic literature, which has often begun
to examine effects of target lexical items in isolation, to
then examine them in context; see for example work on
cognates in isolation (e.g., Gerard & Scarborough, 1989;
Sanchez-Casas et al., 1992) and only subsequently in
sentences (Bultena et al., 2014; Van Assche et al.,
2013); or of second-language collocations in isolation
(e.g., Wolter & Gyllstad, 2011) and then in context (e.g.,
Vilkait & Schmitt, 2019; Pulido, 2021b).
2. This sample yielded 920 trials per condition and block in
the present study, which is comparable to (and exceeds
several) previous ERP studies that examined semantic
integration (ranging from 375 to 990 trials per condition
in e.g., Arzouan et al., 2007; Coulson & van Petten, 2002;
Molinaro et al., 2011; Rutter et al., 2012; Tang et al.,
2017).
3. Phrases with average literal ratings greater or smaller
than the scale midpoint (3.5 out of 7) were categorized
as literal and non-literal, respectively.
4. The author is grateful to an anonymous reviewer and the
handling editor for suggesting this. The trial numberbased analysis was possible because unique trigger
numbers were coded for targets at the time of creating
the experiment (but not for individual control items).
5. Because individual ERP triggers were not available for
each individual item in the experiment, the correlational

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

analysis had to be performed on per-participant
averages. This allowed to test the direct association
between individual ERP amplitudes and individual judgement rates for subsets of multiword units. Rmcorr is
ideal for this type of analysis, as it "is used to determine
the relationship between the two continuous variables,
while controlling for the effect of the categorical variable, which in this case is the between-participants variance" (ibid: 3). An interesting alternative for future
studies will be to investigate the association between
properties of individual multiword units and the EEG
responses.
5. Since the effect of block still persisted even after including trial order in the analysis, this provides increased
confidence on the effect of block on the N400. Notwithstanding this, the present study may have been limited
in its ability to fully disentangle the effect of block from
the effect of exposure; this is an aspect that should be
addressed and replicated in further research.
