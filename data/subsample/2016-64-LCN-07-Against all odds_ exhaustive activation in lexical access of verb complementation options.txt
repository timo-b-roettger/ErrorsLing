ABSTRACT

Various findings suggest that once a verb is accessed, all of its complementation options are
activated. This fMRI study examined whether all the complementation options are activated
even in contexts where this seems unnecessary. We examined whether introducing the selected
complement prior to the verb (in topicalised sentences) still involves the activation of all
complementation options. We performed ROI analyses in the left STG, a brain region that has
been linked to the processing of argument structure and the number of complementation
options. In this region, multiple-option verbs elicited greater activations compared with oneoption verbs, both when the complement appeared after the verb and when it appeared preverbally. This suggests encapsulated lexical retrieval of the verb, which involves exhaustive
activation of all its complementation options when the verb is accessed.

Sentence comprehension is a result of a concerted action
of various types of processes and information stores. One
crucial aspect of sentence parsing comes from information stored with the verb. Specifically, beyond information regarding the meaning and sound of the verb,
according to most linguistic and psycholinguistic frameworks, the lexical item of the verb also stores information
regarding the syntactic environments in which it can
appear. Access to this type of information, termed argument structure, was examined in several studies of sentence comprehension, which explored access to this
information in real time while the sentence unfolds,
the way individuals with aphasia access this information,
and the brain substrates that process this information

complement the verb (Chomsky, 1965; van Valin, 2001).
Specifically, we look into verbs that differ in the
number of complementation options that they allow.
We use here the term "complementation options" to
refer to both subcategorisation frames (syntactically
defined options - the various syntactic types of
phrases that can complement the verb)1 and thematic
frames (semantically defined options - the various
types of thematic roles that can complement the verb).
For many verbs, there is no difference between the
number of subcategorisation frames and the number
of thematic frames. In the current study, we do not differentiate between the two types, and only look at verbs for
which the number of subcategorisation options and the
number of thematic frames are the same. Some verbs
can be complemented with several structures: (for
example, "remember" can take a noun-phrase (NP)/
theme as a direct object (Example (1)) or an embedded
clause/proposition (Example (2))). Other verbs, like the
verb "punish", allow only for an NP/theme (direct
object) complement (Example (3)).
(1) Dan remembered Jenny (from the trip to LA).
(2) Dan remembered that Jenny is coming tonight.
(3) Dan punished Jenny.

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

Research exploring the effects of the number of different complementation options (either semantically or
syntactically defined) has shown increased processing
demands for verbs with more options compared with
verbs with fewer options in both behavioural and neuroimaging studies (Ahrens & Swinney, 1995; Fodor, Garrett,
& Bever, 1968; Shapiro et al., 1987, 1989; Shapiro, Gordon,
et al., 1993; Shapiro & Levine, 1990; Shetreet et al., 2007,
2010; Thompson, Lange, Schneider, & Shapiro, 1997;
although see Schmauder, 1991; Schmauder, Kennison,
& Clifton, 1991). This effect was observed, for example,
in studies that used reaction times in a secondary task
as an index of processing load. These studies revealed
that both healthy controls and individuals with Broca's
aphasia show increased reaction times as a function of
the number of semantically defined complementation
options of verbs that were presented within sentences
with identical structures (Shapiro et al., 1987, 1989;
Shapiro, Gordon, et al., 1993; Shapiro & Levine, 1990).
By contrast, individuals with Wernicke's aphasia do not
show sensitivity to number of complementation
options (Shapiro, Gordon, et al., 1993). This seems to
suggest that posterior temporal regions, including Wernicke's area (which are typically lesioned in individuals
with Wernicke's aphasia, although see Dick et al., 2001;
Dronkers, Plaisant, Iba-Zizen, & Cabanis, 2007) are
involved in processing complementation options.
An effect of the number of options was also observed
in neuroimaging studies using brain activation as a
measurement of processing load. In a previous fMRI
study, we compared sentences including verbs that can
appear with one, two, or three complementation
options (Shetreet et al., 2007). A graded activation as a
function of the number of options was observed in the
left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and in two
sub-regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus. A similar
pattern of activation was found when we compared sentences including verbs with two complementation
options and sentences including verbs with one complementation option (Shetreet, Friedmann, & Hadar, 2010).
In that study, some of our comparisons showed activations in the left STG only.
Taken together, the results from normal language processing indicate that the number of options affects verb
access, such that the entire set of complementation
options is activated at some point during processing: if
only one option was activated for each verb, we would
not see any difference between verbs with one possible
complementation option and verbs with many complementation options, appearing in the same syntactic
environment. Therefore, the findings suggest an exhaustive activation of all the complementation options that
the verb allows.

This effect might be related to the fact that when we
hear the verb in languages like English and Hebrew, we
usually do not know yet which option is going to be relevant to this specific sentence. It is debated whether
information as to the complementation option that is relevant for the sentence, when such information is indeed
present, would restrict the activation of the complementation option set. According to modular approaches,
lexical access is encapsulated so that it is impenetrable
by information from other cognitive domains or
"central processes" (Fodor, 1983). Specifically, language
processing is argued to be driven solely by information
achieved from the input (auditory or visual) and not by
world knowledge or contextual cues (e.g. Onifer &
Swinney, 1981; Swinney, 1979; Swinney, Zurif, & Nicol,
1989). On the other hand, interactionist approaches
argue it can be affected by other domains (e.g. MacDonald, Pearlmutter, & Seidenberg, 1994; Trueswell et al.,
1993). In the context of the current study, the question
of modularity pertains to the language system itself.
That is, we ask whether one aspect of language processing, lexical access, is affected by other linguistic
aspects (i.e. syntactic structure) that are available to the
system at the time of access, or whether lexical access
is encapsulated within the language system.
Specifically, we investigated whether eliminating the
uncertainty regarding the syntactic structure of the sentence - and hence of the complement of a verb with
multiple options - could result in a reduction in processing load when the verb is accessed. We tested this question by introducing information that renders the
activation of the entire set of complementation options
unnecessary. We leveraged the flexible word order of
Hebrew to construct sentences that can restrict the activation of the complementation options set. Although the
canonical word order in Hebrew is Subject Verb Object
(SVO), like in English, Hebrew is flexible with regard to
the word orders it allows. Importantly for the current
study, orders in which the object (the complement of
the verb) appears before the verb are possible (e.g. the
OSV word order). Such non-canonical word order presents an opportunity to examine whether exhaustive
activation of the complementation options of a verb
occurs when the selected option is already known
when the verb is reached.
Testing whether other options are accessed when
the realised option is known before the verb, Shapiro,
Zurif, and Grimshaw (1989) used English passive cleft
sentences and object Wh questions to position the
object before the verb. Sentences in different conditions were identical except for the verb they included:
either four-option verbs or two-option verbs. In a secondary lexical decision task, four-option verbs were

1208

recognised more slowly than two-option verbs in these
two types of sentential contexts. This was a first indication that exhaustive activation of the options set
takes place even when the object appears before the
verb. The two structures used in the Shapiro et al.'s
study involved some structural modifications: (1) the
verb was morphologically modified to adjust to the
passive form in one structure ("was sent" in "It was
[to the girl] that the letter was sent last week") and
(2) the object was modified to a wh-element and the
auxiliary verb moved before the subject in the other
structure ("To whom was the box sent yesterday?").
One should bear in mind, however, that changing the
verb form into the passive form may have affected
the activation of the verb's options. It is possible that
accessing a verb in the passive form, which involves
morphological and lexical-syntactic operations, differs
from accessing a verb in the active form thus promoting the activation of the option set independently of
the actual sentence in which the verb is presented.
In the current study, we asked a similar question, with a
few modifications. First, Hebrew allowed us to present the
complement pre-verbally without changing the verb
form or the object form. That is, we used an ObjectSubject-Verb order, in which the verb form and the
object form remain the same as in the canonical SVO
word order, but the object is moved to a pre-verbal position (see Example (6) in contrast to the canonical word
order of Hebrew in (5)).

Another new contribution of our investigation is that it
used brain activations in fMRI, relying on prior knowledge
of brain regions associated with argument structure processing. We focused on the left STG, which according to
data from aphasia and neuroimaging studies plays a critical role in processing of argument structure information
(Ben-Shachar, Hendler, Kahn, Ben-Bashat, & Grodzinsky,
2003; Edwards, 2002; Meltzer-Asscher, Schuchard, den
Ouden, & Thompson, 2013; Shapiro, Gordon, et al., 1993;
Shetreet et al., 2007, 2010). Specifically, this area has
shown sensitivity to the number of complementation
options in both aphasic patients and neuroimaging
studies (Shapiro, Gordon, et al., 1993; Shetreet et al.,
2007, 2010). Neuroimaging studies found that this area
shows increased activation for verbs with more complementation options compared with verbs with fewer
complementation options.2

To test whether the entire set of complementation
options is activated even when the object is presented
prior to the verb, we examined brain activations of multiple-option verbs and one-option verbs in SVO and OSV
orders. If the fact that the realised option has already
appeared inhibits the later activation of the other potential complementation options of the verb, multipleoption and one-option verbs should show similar brain
activations in the OSV orders. Multiple-option verbs in
OSV order compared with the same verbs in the SVO
order would further show reduced brain activations in
areas related to number of options. Conversely, if all of
the options are exhaustively activated even when the
type of the option is already known prior to the verb,
the number of options should not interact with word
order. That is, sentences with multiple-option verbs
should show increased activations compared to oneoption verbs in brain regions sensitive to number of
options, both when the complement precedes the verb
(OSV order), and when the complement follows it (SVO
order).

Methods
Participants
Fifteen healthy adult volunteers (25-35 years, mean age
= 28;4, 9 females) participated in our study. All of them
had normal hearing, no language impairment, and no
psychiatric or neurological history. All participants were
native speakers of Hebrew, which was their sole
mother tongue. They were all right handed. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
The Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Tel Aviv University ethics committees approved the experimental
protocol.

Materials and procedure
Verbs selection
Verbs were selected from the Hebrew Blog Corpus
(Linzen, 2009). We included only verbs that had more
than 200 tokens in the 165-million word corpus. We
automatically extracted all occurrences of the verbs
with each complementation option; the results of the
automatic process were then hand-corrected by two
independent native Hebrew speakers (the first and
second authors). We selected only verbs that have
exactly two arguments (an agent/subject and a theme/
object; no intransitive verbs or verbs with three arguments were included). For each of the selected verbs,
at least one complementation option was a syntactically

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

simple (non-clausal) complement (i.e. a noun phrase or a
prepositional phrase), which was the option used in the
sentences. This was done to avoid any syntactic complexity effects that could confound the argument structure effects. We selected eight verbs with a single
complementation option (one-option verbs), and eight
verbs with two options or more (multiple-option verbs)
for which the possible options were relatively balanced
(the most likely option appeared in 40-60% of their
entries).

Stimuli construction
The verbs were embedded in sentences with an animate
subject (female or male) and an object that included a
modifier (Table 1). Each verb was embedded in four
different SVO sentences and their four corresponding
OSV sentences (i.e. eight sentences). We had a total of
128 (32*4) sentences, defined by the combination of
verb class (one-option or multiple-option) and word
order (SVO or OSV).3 The sentences were recorded by a
native speaker of Hebrew, and were presented auditorily.
The verbs were controlled for frequency as determined based on the Hebrew Blog Corpus (Linzen,
2009). No significant frequency differences was found
among the conditions, t(14) = 0.67, p = .52 (mean frequency out of a million of the multiple-option and oneoption verbs: 24.4 (SD = 45.4), and 13.6 (SD = 9.8),
respectively, for the combined frequencies of masculine
and feminine forms). We also controlled for the average
frequency of the words in each sentence, because our
conditions included different wording (average frequency for sentences including multiple-option verbs
and one-option verbs: 8.13 and 7.93 respectively).
There were no significant differences between the conditions (t(62) = 0.59, p = .55). The number of syllables in
each sentence was measured, to control for duration
differences between the different conditions, and no
difference was found between the sentences with
one-option and sentences with multiple-option verbs
(t(62) = 0.63, p = .53).

The sentences were divided into 32 blocks. Each block
consisted of four sentences of the same condition. Each
verb appeared in a block only once. The blocks were presented in two runs, each lasting approximately 8 min.
The blocks and the sentences in each block were presented in a pseudo-random order, with no more than
two consecutive blocks of the same condition. The
order of the blocks was re-randomised after every five
participants. The presentation of each block lasted 14 s.
Sentences were separated by silence periods of
1500 ms. A tone was heard at the end of each block to
signal 10 or 12 s of silence. During silence, subjects
were instructed to concentrate on the noises of the
MRI scanner. Stimuli were delivered to the subjects via
MRI-compatible headphones using Presentation software (http://nbs.neuro-bs.com).

Procedure
Throughout the experiment, participants performed a
semantic task to ensure that they were attending to
the sentences and processing them fully. In this task,
the participants were requested to listen to the sentence
and decide whether the event described in the sentence
was positive or not. For example, for the sentence "Dana
met the cruel robber", participants had to press the "no"
button; for the sentence "Dan hugged the aunt from Jerusalem", they were expected to press the "yes" button.
There were equal numbers of predicted "yes" and "no"
responses in the entire experiment, and they were randomised between and within the blocks, so that each
block had a different number of "yes" responses. Participants were instructed to press the "yes" button or the
"no" button with their left hand fingers (to avoid interference in frontal language areas) after the sentences
ended. Responses were not allowed before the end of
a sentence or after the beginning of the following
sentence.
All responses were recorded. For two of the participants, we had a technical problem, where responses
from one button were not recorded. Considering that
the responses from the operating button matched the
expected responses on almost all of the trials, we
included them in the analysis. Each of the other participants gave the expected response on more than 75%
of the sentences (mean = 91.1%, SD = 5%).
Each participant completed a short practice session
outside and inside the MRI scanner. The four practice
blocks included sentences that were similar to those
used in the experiment, but with verbs that were not
included in the experiment. The experiment lasted
approximately 16 min (with both runs combined), and
the entire imaging session (including practice,

anatomical and other functional scans) lasted approximately an hour.

Data acquisition
MRI scans were conducted in a whole-body 3 Tesla,
General Electric scanner, located at the Wohl Institute
for Advanced Imaging in the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical
Center. Functional MRI protocols included T2*-weighted
images in two runs of 450 volumes. We selected 39 sagittal slices (based on a mid-sagittal slice), 3 mm thick (no
gap), covering the whole of the cerebrum and most of
the cerebellum. We used an FOV of 20 cm and a matrix
size of 64 x 64, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30, and flip angle = 90.

Data analysis
Image analysis was performed using SPM8 (Wellcome
Department of Cognitive Neurology, http://www.fil.ion.
ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Functional images from each subject
were motion-corrected, normalised to the SPM EPI template, resampled with a voxel size of 3 x 3 x 3 mm (Ashburner & Friston, 1999), and spatially smoothed using a
Gaussian filter (8-mm kernel). Head motion parameters
were added as regressors (Friston et al., 1995). Each subject's data was analysed using a general linear model
(Friston et al., 1995) and high-pass filtered at 128 s. The
onsets of the block for each condition were modelled
with the canonical hemodynamic response function.

Region of interest (ROI) analysis: We performed ROI
analysis for the STG activation found in Shetreet et al.
(2010) for number of options.4 We defined a 10 mm
sphere around the peak MNI coordinate of this activation
(-51, -54, 24). Average beta values of all the conditions
were extracted from the ROIs using MarsBar and a 2 x
2 ANOVA was performed to compare the effects of
word order on processing multiple-option verbs.

Results
To assess the effects of word order on the activation of
multiple complementation options, we performed an
ROI analysis using a sub-region within the left STG. This
region was previously shown to be involved in
processing complementation options, specifically
demonstrating increased activation to multiple-option
verbs compared with verbs with only one complement
option. A 2 x 2 ANOVA showed a main effect for the
number of options (F(1,56) = 12.33, p = .003). The main
effect of word order5 and the interaction between
number of options and word order did not reach
significance (F(1,56) < 2.8, p > .11; see Figure 1). Follow
up t-tests showed, as expected, increased activation for
SVO sentences with multiple-option verbs compared
with SVO sentences with one-option verbs (t(14) = 3.18,
p = .003, d = 1.70), consistent with increased activation
for multiple-option verbs, in the left STG. The critical
comparison, of OSV sentences with multiple-option
verbs and OSV sentences with one-option verbs,

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

showed the same pattern of increased activation for the
multiple-option verbs even though the selected option
already appears in the beginning of the sentence (t(14)
= 1.93, p = .03, d = 1.03). Importantly, OSV sentences
and SVO sentences with multiple-option verbs did not
show a significant difference in this ROI (t(14) = 1.01, p
= .16). Namely, there were similar activation patterns in
the left STG when the object was realised before or
after the verb, suggesting similar exhaustive access to
multiple-option verbs regardless of the sentence
structure.

Discussion
This study used neuroimaging to explore verb access
during sentence processing. We manipulated the verb
and its sentential context in an attempt to determine
whether all of the verb's complementation options are
exhaustively activated also when the relevant option is
already known at the verb position and there is no ambiguity with regard to the syntactic type of the complement. We specifically looked at the left STG, which is
consistently linked to the processing of argument structure information (Ben-Shachar et al., 2003; Edwards,
2002; Meltzer-Asscher et al., 2013; Shapiro, Gordon,
et al., 1993; Shetreet et al., 2007, 2010), and specifically,
to the number of complementation options of the
verb: the more complementation options a verb has,
the more active this region is (Shetreet et al., 2007).
We observed greater activations in the left STG when
comparing multiple-option verbs with one-option verbs,
regardless of sentence structure. Multiple-option verbs
still showed greater activation than one-option verbs
even when the complement appeared before the verb.
Furthermore, multiple-option verbs did not show differential activation in sentence structures in which the
complement appeared before or after the verb.
These findings support exhaustive access to the verb's
complementation options: they show that when a verb is
accessed, the entire set of complementation options is
initially activated, disregarding highly relevant sentential
information. This is in line with reaction times findings in
English using other sentence structures (passive and whquestions in Shapiro et al., 1989). Across different syntactic structures, the entire set of complementation options
was still activated. This is also in line with priming studies
that show activation of the full argument set even with
missing arguments (Cai, Pickering, Wang, & Branigan,
2015). This supports the idea of encapsulated information flow within the linguistic system (Fodor, 1983).
The above finding suggests that certain aspects of
argument structure access may be independent from
other lexical and grammatical considerations. Multiple

1211

sources of information are used to arrive at the correct
interpretation of a sentence, some of which may possibly
come into play following the lexical access to the verb.
Future research should characterise the time course of
lexical access of verbs to further inform the question of
how information regarding complementation options is
used during sentence processing. The limited temporal
resolution of fMRI did not allow us to determine at
what stage during sentence processing the options are
accessed, and whether some of the options are deactivated rapidly. Techniques with better temporal resolution (e.g. ERP or MEG) can address this question more
adequately than fMRI. Interestingly, a single-word MEG
study showed that information related to complementation options affects neural activity in the left temporal
lobe between 200 and 300 ms, earlier than word frequency effects (Linzen, Marantz, & Pylkkanen, 2013).
This early effect, which was obtained outside of a sentential context, suggests that complementation options are
automatically activated when the verb is read, consistent
with the results of the current study. They are also consistent with lexical retrieval models that suggest that
complementation options are stored in a syntactic
lexicon, which precedes the phonological output
lexicon, which is organised by word frequency (Biran &
Friedmann, 2012; Miozzo & Caramazza, 1997; Nickels &
Howard, 2000).
Although rarely discussed in the argument structure
literature (but see Shapiro et al., 1987, 1989), exhaustive
activation upon lexical access is often mentioned with
regard to lexical ambiguity of words, starting with the
seminal work of David Swinney. For example, the
noun "organ" has two possible meanings: (1) a
musical instrument or (2) a body part. A prominent
approach argues that an exhaustive, bottom-up,
access to the lexical entry of a word is performed in
order to arrive at the appropriate meaning (e.g.
Prather & Swinney, 1988; Swinney, 1982; although see
constraint-based models, e.g. Duffy, Morris, & Rayner,
1988; Glucksberg, Kreuz, & Rho, 1986). Several studies
using various methodologies showed that both
interpretations of ambiguous nouns are momentarily
activated when accessing the word (e.g. Huettig &
Altmann, 2004, 2007; Oden & Spira, 1983; Tanenhaus,
Leiman, & Seidenberg, 1979). Interestingly, Swinney
and his colleagues found that this exhaustive activation
is encapsulated of frequency and semantic context: all
meanings were activated even when one interpretation
was more frequent than the other (e.g. Onifer &
Swinney, 1981), or when the context restricted the
interpretation (e.g. Onifer & Swinney, 1981; Seidenberg,
Tanenhaus, Leiman, & Bienkowski, 1982; Swinney, 1979;
Swinney et al., 1989).

Verb complementation options can be viewed as a
similar instance of lexical ambiguity, in this case, ambiguity with respect to the syntactic category of the complement. That is, whereas noun ambiguity represents
lexical-semantic ambiguity, the type of verb ambiguity
we examined here, with respect to the complement
types, is a lexical-syntactic one (Biran & Friedmann,
2012). Interestingly, MacDonald et al. (1994) suggested
that ambiguities derived from information stored in the
mental lexicon are processed by the same mechanism.
This could suggest that if exhaustive access applies in
lexical ambiguity resolution of word meaning, a similar
mechanism applies to lexical-syntactic ambiguity of
complementation options of verbs that was tested in
the current study. This is indeed indicated by our
results. Parallels between the two types of ambiguity
can be found in re-analysis of sentences with noun ambiguity and with verb frame ambiguity in individuals with
conduction aphasia (Friedmann & Gvion, 2007).
Additionally, neuroimaging and computational studies
have linked left posterior temporal regions to the processing of noun ambiguity (e.g. Davis et al., 2007; Harpaz,
Levkovitz, & Lavidor, 2009; Rodd, Davis, & Johnsrude,
2005; Snijders et al., 2009; Thivierge, Titone, & Shultz,
2005). Specifically, it has been suggested that temporal
regions are involved in retrieval of lexical information,
whereas the frontal regions are responsible for higherlevel functions that integrate the lexical information
(Rodd, Longe, Randall, & Tyler, 2010; Snijders et al.,
2009; Thivierge et al., 2005).
Our study confirms that the left STG is involved in processing of lexical information related to argument structure and multiple complementation options of verbs. It
further shows encapsulation of the activation of the complementation option set, as no effect was observed for
knowing the complementation option prior to the
verb. These results clearly suggest that accessing the
lexical entry of the verb exhaustively activates all the
complementation options of the verb, and that it disregards the sentential context that constrains the possible
options.

regions as well (Den Ouden, Fix, Parrish, & Thompson,
2009; Shetreet et al., 2007, 2010), individuals with
Broca's aphasia (which usually involves lesion to frontal
regions, although see Dick et al., 2001; Dronkers et al.,
2007) showed the typical pattern with these verbs
(Shapiro, Gordon, et al., 1993; Shapiro & Levine, 1990).
This may suggest that the frontal regions may participate
in the processing of this linguistic aspect, but are not
necessary for it.
3. A fifth condition not reported in this manuscript was also
included in these experimental runs, so in fact, subjects
read a total of 160 sentences. Those sentences had
similar properties to the SVO sentences.
4. We chose to use the coordinates from Shetreet et al.
(2010), rather than those from Shetreet et al. (2007), for
two reasons: (a) The current study was conducted in
the same MRI scanner (3T) as Shetreet et al. (2010) and
(b) The current study, like Shetreet et al. (2010), used a
binary comparison (e.g. multiple options > one option)
rather than a parametric comparison (e.g. three options
> two options > one option).
5. Sentences with a topicalised object often show activations in posterior temporal regions (e.g. Ben-Shachar
et al., 2003; Shetreet & Friedmann, 2014). In the current
study, we did not see a significant word order effect in
our STG ROI. This is probably because the ROI was
defined based on coordinates from studies that specifically investigated the representation of argument structure, rather than studies that investigated topicalisation
or Wh-movement. It is likely that different sub-regions
within the posterior STG have different functions (as
was also described with regards to the IFG, e.g. Bookheimer, 2002).

Notes
1. There have been attempts, both within linguistic theory
and within studies that tested the effect of number of
options on processing, to dispense with subcategorisation, and keep only thematic frames. As we discuss and
show empirically in Shetreet et al. (2007), subcategorisation still bears explanatory power in the effect of number
of options on processing, beyond the number of thematic frames.

been shown to modulate brain activity in frontal
