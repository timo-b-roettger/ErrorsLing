Word Learning by Preschoolers
With Specific Language Impairment:
Effect of Phonological or
Semantic Cues
Shelley Gray
Arizona State University, Tempe

Purpose: This study investigated whether phonological or semantic encoding cues
promoted better word learning for children with specific language impairment (SLI)
and whether this treatment differentially affected children with SLI and normal
language (NL).
Method: Twenty-four preschoolers ages 4;0 (years;months) to 5;11 with SLI and
24 age- and gender-matched children with NL participated. The between-group
factor was language group (NL, SLI) and within-group factors were language
modality (comprehension, recognition, production) and treatment condition
(phonological, semantic). Word learning was assessed during fast mapping,
word learning, and posttesting with trials to criterion calculated for the number of
words learned. A drawing task assessed the change in semantic representation
of words.
Results: The SLI group comprehended more words in the semantic condition and
produced more words in the phonological condition, but the NL group performed
similarly in both. The NL group required significantly fewer trials than the SLI
group to comprehend words in the semantic and phonological conditions and to
produce words in the semantic condition, but between-group differences for
production were not significant for the phonological condition.
Conclusions: The results suggest that preschoolers with SLI may benefit from cues
that highlight the phonological or semantic properties of words but that different
cues may aid different aspects of word learning.

hildren with specific language impairment (SLI) have difficulty
learning to comprehend and to produce new words. As a group,
their initial vocabulary growth is slow (Paul, 1996; Rescorla,
Roberts, & Dahlsgaard, 1997), and they produce a smaller variety of
words than their normally developing peers (Watkins, Kelly, Harbers,
& Hollis, 1995). In experimental word-learning studies, young children with SLI have difficulty fast-mapping new words (Dollaghan,
1987; Gray, 2003b, 2004; Rice, Buhr, & Nemeth, 1990) and learning
them in contexts that provide limited support (Rice, Buhr, & Oetting,
1992; Rice, Oetting, Marquis, Bode, & Pae, 1994) or extensive support
(Kiernan & Gray, 1998; Gray, 2003b, 2004). Furthermore, SLI groups
typically score significantly lower than normal language (NL) groups on

norm-referenced receptive and expressive vocabulary
tests (e.g., Gray, Plante, Vance, & Henrichsen, 1999).
To learn words, children must segment utterances
into meaningful words and store sufficient phonological information about each word to recognize and to
elaborate it over time. To produce a word, the phonological representation must be strong enough to
permit consistent retrieval and output of its phonological form. When learning words, children must also
attend to the semantic cues in the environment, must
store and retrieve the derived meaning of words, and
must associate meaning with the phonological form
of the word. In models of language production (e.g.,
Caramazza, 1997) it is generally agreed that this phonological and semantic knowledge is represented at
three levels: (a) the conceptual level; (b) the lemma
level, with semantically and syntactically specified
information; and (c) the lexeme level, with phonological
form specifications. Failure to produce new words
might result from problems at any or all of these levels.
More than a decade ago, Gathercole and Baddeley
(1989) proposed that phonological memory deficits
underlie poor word learning by children with SLI.
Their model of short-term memory includes a phonological loop with two components: The first holds phonological memory traces, whereas the second, a subvocal
rehearsal system, maintains those traces in the memory store. The model proposes that temporary storage of
unfamiliar phonological forms contributes importantly to
construction of more permanent memory representations, or lexemes, in long-term memory. According
to Gathercole and Baddeley (1989), children with SLI
have difficulty creating long-term representations
of words because of limited short-term phonological
memory capacity. They measured this capacity using
nonword repetition and digit span tasks. In 1989 they
found that a group of 8-year-old children with SLI performed below both age- and language-matched control
groups on nonword repetition and digit span tasks.
This led them to conclude that the vocabulary deficits
of children with SLI were attributable to impaired phonological storage. This relationship between phonological memory capacity and vocabulary growth was
supported when later investigations found significant
correlations between nonword repetition performance
and vocabulary growth in normally developing 4-
5-year-old children (Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, &
Baddeley, 1992) and in normally developing adolescents (Gathercole, Service, Hitch, Adams, & Martin,
1999). A number of other studies have also documented
that SLI groups perform below NL groups on shortterm memory tasks (Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996;
Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Edwards & Lahey, 1998;
Ellis Weismer et al., 2000; Gathercole & Baddeley,
1990; Gray, 2003a).

Researchers have also shown that children with
SLI demonstrate semantic processing deficits that may
negatively affect word learning. These deficits are
often quantified using vocabulary tests to index children's semantic knowledge, which presents a problem
because phonology and semantics are confounded in
vocabulary measures. A different approach has been
to study the naming errors of children with SLI that
do not directly address word learning but do illustrate
how semantic deficits might interfere with children's
production of new words.
Lahey and Edwards (1999) administered a picturenaming task to 66 children with SLI ages 4;3 (years;
months) to 9;7 and to their matched NL peers. The SLI
group made significantly more naming errors than the
NL group. A greater proportion of SLI group errors than
NL group errors were semantically associated with the
target names. In these instances, children ``named an
object associated with the target and the name may or
may not have been within the same semantic category
or the same part of speech (e.g., key/ lock; dust / broom)''
(Lahey & Edwards, 1999, p. 205). The authors speculated that these errors were due to ``diffuse semantic-
lexical representations.'' In other words, children may
have had difficulty differentiating between stored
representations or had poor organization of representations at the lemma level that hindered accurate word
retrieval. Lahey and Edwards also found that phonological errors differentiated the SLI and NL groups in
this study, but these types of errors were less frequent
than semantic errors. In these instances, children responded with names that were ``phonologically similar
to the name of the target (i.e., at least half of the response phonemes occurred in the same order as in the
target)'' (Lahey & Edwards, p. 205). These less frequently occurring phonological errors may have represented a problem of differentiation at the lexeme level.
McGregor (1997) administered the Test of Word
Finding (German, 1989) and a story-retell task to 24
children ages 3;3 to 5;11. Twelve children had normal
word-finding abilities and no history of communicative
impairment, and 12 children had word-finding deficits
as well as language, speech, or fluency disorders. Both
groups made similar types of naming errors, with semantic errors more prevalent than phonological errors.
The group with word-finding deficits made significantly
more naming errors on both measures than the normal
group. McGregor hypothesized that the semantic errors might be attributed to underelaborated lemmas but
also pointed out that semantic errors could be related
to difficulty accessing the correct lexeme.
McGregor and Appel (2002) used confrontation naming and repeated-naming tasks to examine the naming
errors of a 5-year-old boy with SLI. On the confrontationnaming task, 47% of errors were indeterminate, and

47% were classified as semantic. No errors were classified as phonological. On the repeated-naming task
71% of errors were semantic, 12% were indeterminate,
and 12% were mixed. Only 5% were classified as phonological. Twenty-eight objects that the child named
correctly or named with phonological or semantic substitutions were then selected for a drawing task wherein
examiners prompted him to draw a picture of each object. The boy's drawings of misnamed objects were
rated significantly lower than his drawings of correctly named objects, leading the authors to suggest that
deficits in semantic representation (i.e., lemma level)
were the source of many naming errors.
An ensuing study by McGregor, Newman, Reilly,
and Capone (2002) used the same tasks as in McGregor
and Appel's (2002) study with sixteen 6-year-olds with
SLI and age-matched peers with NL. A word-definition
task was added to the protocol, and children with SLI
were selected, in part, on the basis of their poor performance on a nonword repetition task. As in previous studies, children with SLI made more naming errors than
their NL peers. Semantic and indeterminate errors were
the most common error types for both groups. Semantic
errors comprised association, circumlocution, derivative,
coordinate, or superordinate substitutions that indicated a lack of lemma level representation or differentiation. Indeterminate errors comprised responses such
as ``don't know'' or nonspecific responses that indicated a
lack of conceptual information.
Taken together, these studies suggest that both
phonological and semantic processing present a challenge to children with SLI and that both may interfere
with comprehension and production of new words. It is
not clear whether poor word learners tend to have more
difficulty with phonology or semantics, an important
consideration when planning intervention. Furthermore, deficits in one area would be expected to affect
performance in the other, but this has not been explored
in children with SLI. Storkel (2001) recently investigated whether the creation of phonological representations of new words (i.e., lexemes) might affect the
formation of semantic representations (i.e., lemmas) in
normally developing preschool children. She found that
children learned nonwords composed of common sound
sequences more rapidly than those composed of rare
sound sequences. This suggests that phonological
regularities influence the creation of semantic representations and influence the associations between
phonological and semantic representations. Thus, children who have difficulty forming phonological representations of words (lexemes) might also be expected to
have difficulty forming underlying semantic representations (lemmas; Storkel & Morrisette, 2002).
If this is the case, what type of intervention might
help children create stable phonological representa-

1454

tions of words? A recent word-learning study involving
normally developing 4-year-olds found that phonological cues aided production of new words. Demke,
Graham, and Siakaluk (2002) demonstrated that
exposure to a phonological neighbor of a new word
after hearing it resulted in correct production of the
target word more often than when children did not
receive an exposure. Children who heard the phonological neighbors of the novel words after being taught
the new word correctly produced the target word more
often than children who heard unrelated words. The
authors suggested that exposure to similar-sounding
words after being taught the novel word helped maintain the new word in working memory, resulting in an
increased probability that a long-term representation of
the word (lexeme) would be stored in memory.
The purpose of this study was to investigate
whether phonological or semantic cues, presented immediately after new words were modeled, would promote better word learning for children with SLI and
whether this treatment would differentially affect children with SLI and NL. The hypothesis was that phonological cues could strengthen the initial phonological
representation of words (i.e., lexeme level) and that
semantic cues could facilitate creation of semantic representations of words (i.e., lemma level).
Children's fast-mapping and word learning were
assessed with comprehension and production probes
each day of the study. Comprehension, recognition, and
production probes at the end of the study provided a
means of quantifying learning when all children had
received equal learning opportunities for each word. A
drawing task adapted from McGregor and Appel (2002)
provided a method to assess the change in children's
semantic representation of the words from the beginning to the end of the study.

Method
Participants
Twenty-four children diagnosed with SLI (SLI
group) and 24 children with normally developing language (NL group) participated in the study. Each child
with NL was selected to match a child with SLI for
gender and age (T3 months). All children were between
the ages of 4;0 and 5;11 and spoke Standard American
English as their primary language. A language-matched
group was not included because of the cognitive and attentional differences between younger children with
NL and older children with SLI that may affect task
performance (cf. Plante, Swisher, Kiernan, & Restrepo,
1993). Descriptive information about both groups
using t tests to compare group means is provided in

were Native American, and 13 were White. In the SLI
group, 1 child was Asian, 8 were Hispanic, 1 reported
no ethnicity, and 14 were White.
To qualify for the study, children with SLI
had to be enrolled in language therapy. To qualify for
these services in Arizona, children must score more
than 1.5 SDs below the mean on two norm-referenced
language tests. Certified speech-language pathologists administered additional speech and language
tests to further describe the children. This selection
process results in a heterogeneous participant group
but allows for generalization of findings to the population of children with SLI whom speech-language
pathologists serve on their treatment caseloads. The
mean group scores on these measures are provided
in Table 1.
Children with SLI were recruited from public school
and clinic programs. Children with NL were recruited
from public school and child care programs. A certified
speech-language pathologist determined that each
child met the following selection criteria:
1.

Hearing within normal limits bilaterally (20-25 dB
HL) at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz
(American National Standards Institute, 1989).

2.

Normal nonverbal intelligence as indicated by a
standard score of 75 or above on the Nonverbal

scale of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for
Children (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1983).
3.

For children with SLI, with the exception of language, articulation, or phonological problems, no
evidence of a frank neurological problem or additional
developmental disorders reported by the parent.

4.

Speech intelligibility judged to be adequate for applying scoring procedures.

5.

For children with NL, age-expected progress in
school as reported by teacher.

6.

For children with NL, normal motor, cognitive,
social-emotional, speech, and language development as reported by parents and teacher.

Phonological Memory Task
The nonword-repetition task developed by Dollaghan
and Campbell (1998) was administered to assess phonological memory. Nonwords were presented to children
via computer over headphones. Children's repetitions
were recorded into WAV computer files or on audiotape via microphone. Trained research assistants (RAs)
later calculated the percentage phonemes correct for
each child. Phonemes were scored as incorrect if the
child substituted or omitted a phoneme. Distortions
and additions were not scored as incorrect. The group

means of 87.20 (SD = 14.07) for the NL group and 62.45
(SD = 24.41) for the SLI group were significantly
different, t(40) = 4.07, p = .0003, h2 = 1.01. Ten samples (5 NL children and 5 SLI children) selected at
random were scored by a second RA. Point-to-point
agreement between the two coders was 83% (range:
77%-92%).

research session lasted approximately 30 min. Children accompanied their RA to a separate room at their
preschool, where they sat at a child-sized table or on
the floor. The same RA worked with the child each day.
Seven undergraduate students majoring in speech and
hearing science served as RAs. They were required to
demonstrate standardized presentation and scoring of
the research tasks prior to study initiation.

Word-Learning Materials

During the first 3 days of the study, children completed testing and the nonword-repetition task. On the
next day, a Monday, they completed the fast-mapping
and drawing tasks for their first word set. On Tuesday
through Friday of that same week (Days 5-8), they completed the word-learning task. The following Monday
they completed posttask and drawing assessments for
their first word set. Children did not participate in
research the remaining days of that week (Days 10-13)
unless they were behind schedule. The following week
children repeated the same schedule with their second word set. Because of absences, some children did
not complete the studies in the planned amount of
time. The mean number of days to complete the fastmapping and word learning for Set A was 5.38 for the
NL group and 5.37 for the SLI group. Set B required
5.65 days for the NL group and 5.35 days for the SLI
group.

Target and common objects. Target objects that
children would learn to name were selected from a
variety of craft and hardware items. Initially, 10 adults
were asked to name an array of these objects. Those
they inconsistently named and those that evoked the
same name from each adult were selected for further
review. Next, the objects were shown to six 5-year-old
children with NL who were not included in this study.
Four objects that evoked the same name from every
child (hereafter referred to as familiar objects) and four
that were never named correctly (hereafter referred to
as unfamiliar objects) were selected. Both types of objects were included in the study to reflect the challenge
that young children face when learning new words. For
example, they must learn names for items they have
not encountered before (e.g., whisk) and must also learn
new names for entities already represented in their lexicon (e.g., Dalmatian for a kind of dog). The eight target
objects were divided into two sets (A, B), described in
Table 2. Additional common objects that children could
readily name were also included (e.g., box, table, monkey),
because previous studies indicated that children were
more likely to try to name target objects when they
could successfully name other objects in the study.
Target words. The target words that children
learned as names for the target objects are listed in
Table 2. They were chosen from a list of two-syllable,
CVCVC English words pronounced with stress on the
first syllable. Because of their low incidence in spoken
English (Hall, Nagy, & Linn, 1984), the words were
assumed to be unfamiliar to preschool children.

General Procedure
Children participated in the study for 19 days,
as illustrated by the timeline in Appendix A. Each

Fast-Mapping
The three phases used by RAs for the fast-mapping
task are illustrated in Appendix B. They are the same
procedures used in previous studies (Gray, 2003b,
2004). During Phase I, the RA modeled the name for
each of the four target and four common objects as they
were presented to the child (e.g., ``This is the [target
word]''). Next, the RA administered a comprehension
probe for each of the target and common objects (e.g.,
``Hand me the [target word]''). Finally, the RA administered a production probe for each object (e.g., ``What's
this?'' or ``What are you holding?''). The procedures for
Phases II and III were identical to Phase I. All eight
objects (four target and four common) were on the table
during these probes. The RA administered the models
and probes for each word in randomized order within
each phase. Children received 1 point for each correct
response to a probe with no feedback regarding the

accuracy of their responses. By the end of the session,
the child had heard the names for target and common
objects modeled three times and had completed three
comprehension and three production probes. Because
the comprehension probes required the RA to say the
name of each object, the child actually heard each word
spoken six times.

Word Learning
The same eight objects (four targets, four common)
used in Day 1 of the fast-mapping task were used during word learning along with a play set. One play set
was a Playmobil adventure scenario (e.g., a hideout,
palm trees, sand, and a family of four) and the other
was a Playmobil camping scenario (e.g., a cabin, pine
trees, water, and a family of four). These were counterbalanced across children and word sets.
The four phases used by RAs for the word-learning
task are illustrated in Appendix B. They are similar
to procedures used in previous studies (Gray, 2003b,
2004). During Phase I, the RA modeled the name of
each target object as it was presented to the child,
followed by a prompt for immediate imitation of the
name (e.g., ``This is the fogut I say fogut''), followed
by a semantic or phonological cue (e.g., ``It's made of
plastic'' for the semantic cue or ``It starts with /f /'' for
the phonological cue). A second model, imitation prompt,
and semantic or phonological cue for each object followed. Next, the RA administered a comprehension
trial for each object (e.g., ``Please hand me the fogut'')
followed by immediate feedback regarding accuracy
of response (e.g., ``Yes, that's the fogut'' or, for an incorrect response, ``Here's the fogut''). Finally, the RA
administered a production trial for each object (e.g.,
``What are you holding?'') followed by immediate feedback regarding accuracy of response (e.g., ``Right, that's
the fogut'' or, for an incorrect response, ``Here's the
fogut''). All objects, as well as items from the play sets,
were available as choices during the comprehension
and production trials. After completion of Phase I, the
RA followed the same procedures for Phases II and III.
Phase IV differed from Phases I, II, and III in that no
models or cues were presented, only comprehension
and production trials with feedback. To summarize, in
each experimental session the child completed four
comprehension trials and four production trials. Because the imitation requests, comprehension trials, and
feedback required the RA to say the name of each
object, the child actually heard each name spoken
24 times each session.
Within each phase of word learning, both models
for a target word were provided before proceeding to a
comprehension trial for that word, and the comprehension trial was administered before the production

trial. Typically, the RA finished the models for all
words before moving on to comprehension and then
production trials. The models and trials for all words
were completed within one phase before moving to the
next phase.
Responses to comprehension trials were scored as
correct if the child showed the RA the correct target
object. Responses to production trials were scored as
correct if the child produced all of the target word's
phonemes correctly or consistently produced the same
phonological variation of the word that preserved the
correct vowel sound in the initial syllable (e.g., /fo dt/
for /fo gt/). The same criteria were used for feedback
responses. The child's immediate imitation of target
words informed scoring of questionable productions.
If the child named a target object correctly when
the RA had not provided a model or prompt, the RA
recorded the response as a spontaneous production
but provided no feedback. If the child spontaneously
named an object incorrectly, the RA provided feedback,
counted this feedback as the next scheduled model, and
elicited an immediate imitation. If the child spontaneously named an object incorrectly, and the RA had
already provided the allotted number of models, no
feedback was provided for the incorrect response.
To assess procedural and scoring reliability, a
second RA scored 20% of the experimental sessions
live. Each RA and each child had at least one session
double-scored, with those sessions selected at random.
The average point-to-point agreement for delivery of
instructional procedures was 98% (range: 91%-100%).
Point-to-point agreement for scoring of child responses
was 96% (range: 71%-100%).
To reach criterion for comprehension or production
of a word, children were required to respond correctly
to three of four trials on 2 of 3 consecutive study days.
Previous findings by Kiernan and Gray (1998) indicated that a NL group of preschoolers could meet this
criterion for three words in the allotted time of 4 days.
Trials to criterion were calculated by counting the
number of trials elapsed before a child reached learning criterion for either comprehension or production of
each word. Fast-mapping probes were not counted as
trials. Teaching continued even after a child met the
learning criterion for a particular word so that, at the
end of the study, when all children had experienced
equal learning opportunities, group performances
could be compared.

Semantic and Phonological Conditions
Each child had the opportunity to learn one set of
words in the semantic condition and one set in the
phonological condition, with word sets counterbalanced

across conditions and children. In the semantic condition, each elicited imitation (described above) was
followed by a semantic cue with information about the
object's superordinate category, physical characteristic,
action/use, parts, or association. For example, cues for
the haymut were ``It's a kind of turtle'' (superordinate),
``It's green'' (physical characteristic), ``It eats grass''
(action), ``It crawls'' (action), ``It has a shell'' (parts), and
``It's kind of like a tortoise'' (association).
In the phonological condition each elicited imitation was followed by a phonological cue with the word's
initial sound, initial syllable, the word produced by
syllable, or a rhyming cue. For example, cues for the
haymut were ``/ h / / h / / h /,'' (initial sound), ``It starts
with / h / '' (initial sound), ``It starts with / he/ '' (initial
syllable), ``/ he/ and /mt / '' (produced by syllable), ``/ he/
(clap) /mt/ (clap),'' and ``It rhymes with /demt / ''
(rhyming).

Drawing
The drawing task measured children's semantic
representation of the target objects. At the end of
the fast-mapping task, the children were asked to draw
pictures of the four target objects and four common
objects from memory. The same task was repeated after
children had completed teaching for that word set. The
objects were not present during the drawing task, and
object order was counterbalanced across children.
To administer the task the RA placed a drawing
book in front of the child and said, ``It's time to do some
fun drawing! This is your very own drawing book.'' The
RA then turned to the first page, pointed to the print at
the top of the page, and said, ``It says draw a X.'' The
RA then traced the large rectangle on the page with
her finger and said, ``You can use the whole box to draw
your picture. Use your pencil to draw the X.'' After the
child completed that drawing, the RA turned the page
and repeated the procedure for each object.
To score the drawings, three adult raters independently rated each child's drawings, considering
them one at a time. Following the procedure developed
by McGregor and Appel (2002), raters were given a
data sheet and instructed to circle the number corresponding to their level of agreement with the following statement: ``This preschool-aged child's drawing
shows an accurate and complete knowledge of X.'' A
score of 1 represented strongly disagree, and a score of
7 represented strongly agree. The child's first and second drawings were counterbalanced across objects. The
actual labeled objects were present for raters to see
during scoring.
The interrater agreement for drawing scores was
high. For example, recalling that the score range was

1458

1 through 7, the mean standard deviation for the three
rater's scores for the first drawing of the monkey for all
children was 0.98 (range: 0-2.08) and was 0.94 (range:
0-2.08) for the second drawing. The mean standard
deviation for the first drawing of the fetid for all children was 0.67 (range: 0-2.31) and 0.89 (range 0-2.08)
for the second drawing.

Posttest Measures
Comprehension, recognition, and production of the
target names were assessed after the last drawing
measure for each word set. These probes provided the
opportunity to quantify learning when all children had
received equal learning opportunities for each word.
The production probe assessed children's ability to
name the object when semantic information was provided (picture of the object) but they had to retrieve and
produce the word's phonology. The recognition probe
assessed children's ability to name the object when semantic information was provided (picture of the object) and phonological information was cued (the child
heard the object name embedded in a list of names).
The comprehension probe assessed children's ability to
identify the object when phonological information was
provided (object name) but they had to retrieve the
semantic information (point to the picture).
Production probes were administered first, followed by recognition and then comprehension probes.
Children earned 1 point for each correct response. For
production and recognition, a single color photograph of
the target object appeared in the center of the page. For
the production probes, the RA pointed to the picture and
asked ``What's this?'' For the recognition probes, the RA
pointed to the picture and said, ``Listen first, then tell
me the right name,'' then spoke four names (one target,
three foils), with the order of the target varying in
relation to the foils. One foil name was phonologically
identical to the target word except that the initial
consonant was changed to a consonant from a different
category (e.g., a stop was substituted for a fricative).
One foil was the name of another target object, and one
foil was a two-syllable, CVCVC English word expected
to be unfamiliar to the child that was not used in the
study. For the comprehension probes, color photographs
(one target and three foils) appeared in a 2  2 array on
each page. The position of the target varied in relation to
the foils. One of the foils on each page depicted a play
object that was present each day during the wordlearning task (e.g., tree), one depicted another target
object, and one depicted an object the child had not seen
during the study that was similar in shape and category
to the target object. For example, the foil for the jamus
(butterfly) was a picture of a bird. Because of the limited
number of possible responses, the probability of a child

responding correctly by chance on the comprehension
or recognition measures (1/4) was higher than for the
production probes; however, performance was significantly above chance for both comprehension (one-sample
t test compared to 25%; t[46] = -157.29, p G .0001) and
recognition (one-sample t test compared to 25%; t[46] =
-78.66, p G .0001).

Results
Preliminary analyses were conducted for all measures to determine whether performance differed for
4- (n = 10) and 5-year-old (n = 14) children. Significant
age differences were found only for fast-mapping comprehension and drawing difference scores. These differences are reported in their respective sections.
Nonparametric statistics were used to analyze
performance on fast-mapping, word learning, and
posttests, because data were not normally distributed.
Scores were low for both groups for fast-mapping production and were near ceiling for the NL group for
word learning comprehension and posttest comprehension, recognition, and production. Spearman rank correlations are also reported for nonparametric analyses.
Repeated measures mixed-factorial analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze trials to criterion
for word learning and drawing data because the scores

represented multiple measures on the same participants and met criteria for parametric analysis.

Fast-Mapping
The number of correct responses to comprehension
and production probes was analyzed using separate
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests corrected for
tied ranks to yield a Z score. The alpha level was set at
.05 (two-tailed) for each comparison. Because preliminary analyses indicated significant between-group differences for age on fast-mapping comprehension (z =
-2.0255, p = .0428, rs = .30), fast-mapping results were
analyzed for group differences by age. Box-and-whisker
plots for fast-mapping comprehension and production
based on median values for each measure are shown
in Figure 1. The lower and upper limit of each box,
respectively, represents the first and third quartiles
of the data. The whiskers represent the range of the
data.
Between-group differences (NL, SLI) were not
significant for comprehension (z = 92.5, p = .8690,
rs = .05) or production (z = 93.00, p = .8221, rs = .06) for
4-year-olds; however, significant between-group differences were found for comprehension (z = 2.2433,
p = .0249, rs = -.043) and production (z = 2.2356,
p = .0254, rs = -.43) for 5-year-olds, with the NL group
scoring higher than the SLI group. As illustrated in

Figure 1. These box-and-whisker plots show the distributional characteristics of children's medians for the number of correct responses to
comprehension and production probes on the fast-mapping task. The box defines the interquartile (q) range; the triangle marks the group
median; the whiskers mark the minimum (min) and maximum (max) values. NL = normal language; SLI = specific language impairment.

Figure 1, one 4-year-old from the SLI group was an
outlier for fast-mapping comprehension, responding
correctly to 22 comprehension probes. Statistical
analyses were rerun without this participant, but
between-group results for comprehension did not
change.
Analyses of within-group differences for age using
Friedman's chi-square indicated that for comprehension, 5-year-olds from the NL group scored higher than
their 4-year-old counterparts, Q(1) = 8.1452, p = .0043,
rs = .59, but there was no significant age difference for
the SLI group, Q(1) = 0.0887, p = .7658, rs = .03. For
production, age differences were not significant for either the NL group, Q(1) = 3.2387, p = .0719, rs = .38, or
the SLI group, Q(1) = 0.0274, p = .8684, rs = -.05.

Words to Criterion
Children had the opportunity to learn eight new
words, four in each condition. Box-and-whisker plots
for the number of words children learned to comprehend and to produce based on median values for each
measure are shown in Figure 2. For comprehension,
significant between-group differences were found for
the semantic (z = 2.56, p = .0103, rs = -.38) and the
phonological conditions (z = 2.71, p = .0068, rs = -.39),
with the NL group learning to comprehend more words
than the SLI group in both conditions. Analyses of

within-group differences for condition (semantic, phonological) using Friedman's chi-square found no significant within-group difference for the NL group,
Q(3) = 6.25, p = .0997, rs = .34, but the SLI group,
Q(3) = 11.9252, p = .0076, rs = .66, learned to comprehend more words in the semantic condition than in
the phonological condition.
For production, significant between-group differences were found for both the semantic (z = 3.00, p = .0027,
rs = -.44) and phonological conditions (z = 3.46,
p = .0005, rs = -.51), with the NL group learning to produce more words than the SLI group in both conditions.
Analyses of within-group differences for condition found
no significant within-group difference for the NL group,
Q(3) = 5.150, p = .1581, rs = .33, but the SLI group, Q(4) =
10.8525, p = .0283, rs = .64, learned to produce more words
in the phonological condition than in the semantic condition.

Trials to Criterion for Word Learning
The mean number of trials children required to
reach the learning criterion for comprehension and
production of a word was analyzed using a repeated
measures, mixed factorial ANOVA with group (NL,
SLI) as the between-group factor and probe type
(comprehension, production) and condition (semantic,
phonological) as the within-group factors. Results are
reported in Table 3. Significant main effects were

h2 = .05. Tukey follow-up ( p G .05) tests indicated that
the NL group required significantly fewer trials than
the SLI group to reach the learning criterion for comprehension of a word in both the semantic and phonological conditions. The NL group also required
significantly fewer trials than the SLI group to learn
to produce a word in the semantic condition; however,
the between-group difference was not significant for
the phonological condition. Both groups required significantly fewer trials to learn to comprehend than to
produce a word.

Word Learning Drawing
Children's drawing difference scores were derived
by subtracting the score from their first drawing of
each target object, completed after the fast-mapping
task, from their second drawing of the same object,
completed after the last day of word learning for each
set. Drawing scores improved for both groups. Because
preliminary analyses indicated significant betweengroup differences for age, F(1, 26) = 4.29, p = .0489, h2 =
.15, a repeated measures mixed-factorial ANOVA with
group and age (age 4, age 5) as between-group factors
and condition as the within-group factor was used
to analyze results. Results are reported in Table 3.
Differences for group, F(1, 23) = 20.57, p = .3214, h2 =
.04; for age, F(1, 23) = 69.52, p = .0753, h2 = .12; and for
condition, F(1, 23) = 43.11, p = .1679, h2 = .07, were not
significant. Preplanned Tukey comparisons ( p G .05)
found no between-group differences for the NL and SLI
groups. Drawing difference scores for 5-year-olds were
significantly higher in the phonological condition than
in the semantic condition for both the NL and the SLI

groups; however, differences were not significant for
4-year-olds for either group.

Posttask Assessment of Comprehension,
Recognition, and Production
Children's comprehension, recognition, and production of target words at the end of word learning
were analyzed using separate nonparametric Mann-
Whitney U tests. Box-and-whisker plots for each measure are shown in Figure 3. Between-group differences
were not significant for comprehension in the semantic (z = 601.00, p = .6266, rs = .07) or phonological
conditions (z = 503.00, p = .0746, rs = .26) or for recognition in the semantic (z = 668.00, p = .0806, rs = .26)
or phonological conditions (z = 494.50, p = .1780,
rs = .22). Significant between-group differences were
found for production in both the semantic (z = 704.50,
p = .0057, rs = .40) and the phonological conditions
(z = 391.00, p = .0001, rs = .61), with the NL group
scoring higher than the SLI group.
Analyses of within-group differences for condition
using Friedman's chi-square indicated that there were
no significant within-group differences for the NL
group: comprehension, Q(1) = 0.0909, p = .7630, rs =
-.06; recognition, Q(3) = 2.9608, p = .3977, rs = .18;
production, Q(2) = 0.2632, p = .8767, rs = -.11; or for the
SLI group: comprehension, Q(2) = 0.6318, p = .7291,
rs = .11; recognition, Q(4) = 4.9961, p = .2877, rs = .52;
production, Q(4) = 7.7102, p = .1028, rs = .25).

Post hoc Analysis of Word Learning
All but 2 children from the NL group learned to
comprehend more than three words and to produce
more than two. This level of performance was, therefore, considered to be normal. On the basis of these
criteria, 2 children from the NL group and 13 from the
SLI group were classified as poor learners.

T tests revealed that the mean scores for normal
and poor learners differed significantly on the Structured Photographic Expressive Language Test--II
(Werner & Krescheck, 1983), t(43) = 2.30, p = .0264,
r = .73, with a mean of 81.59 (SD = 37.88) for the normal learners and a mean of 51.52 (SD = 44.17) for the
poor learners. No significant differences were found for
age or for any other test or experimental task. Mann-
Whitney U tests ( p G .05, two-tailed) indicated that
normal learners scored significantly higher on fastmapping production than did the poor learners (z =
-2.1859, p = .0288, rs = -.32), but normal and poor
learners did not differ significantly on fast-mapping
comprehension (z = -1.7119, p = .0869, rs = -.25). Poor
learners' drawing scores were compared to normal
learners using a mixed-factorial ANOVA with group
(normal, poor) as the between-group factor and condition (semantic, phonological) as the within-group factor. Differences for group, F(1, 25) = 0.16, p = .6927,
h2 = .006, and condition F(1, 23) = 0.34, p = .5628, h2 =
.012, were not significant.
A closer examination of poor learners' performance
indicated that they learned to comprehend three words
as well as normal learners: (a) haymut (a kind of
turtle), (a) humic (a kind of tree), and (c) jasson (a kind
of cactus). Each of these names represented familiar
objects. Their performance was not comparable to that
of normal learners for comprehension or production of

1462

any other word. Poor learners' drawing scores were
evaluated to determine whether they reflected poor
semantic representation of objects. Results indicated
that ratings were low (G 4) for all words that they did
not learn to name.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate
whether phonological or semantic cues promoted better word learning for children with SLI and whether
these cues differentially affected children with SLI and
NL. Consistently better performance in the phonological condition would provide support for Gathercole
and Baddeley's (1989) hypothesis that the vocabulary
deficits of SLI children are due to impaired phonological storage (i.e., creation of lexemes), whereas consistently better performance in the semantic condition
would suggest that storage and retrieval of semantic
information (i.e., lemmas) presents a greater challenge. As discussed below, results suggest that poor
word learners have difficulty with both phonological
and semantic components of word learning and that
different cues facilitated different aspects of the wordlearning process.
In this study, consistently correct responses to
comprehension probes provided evidence that a stable

phonological representation and phonological-semantic
link were achieved because the child consistently chose
the correct object when he or she heard its name. The
near-ceiling performance of the NL group suggests that
they had little difficulty creating stable enough lexemes
and lexeme-lemma links to comprehend the words, but
the significantly poorer performance by the SLI group
suggests that they did experience difficulty with this.
There was evidence that semantic cues helped the SLI
group comprehend new words because they reached
the learning criterion for more words in the semantic condition than in the phonological condition. It is
hypothesized that the semantic cues helped children
with SLI strengthen their lexeme-lemma links, resulting in more accurate responses. Anecdotal support
of this hypothesis was observed when some children
repeated the semantic cues they had heard as they
searched for a referent during a comprehension probe
(e.g., tigon, it's silver). It is further hypothesized that
because the lexeme is provided during comprehension
probes, phonological cues were less useful than semantic cues for this task.
Relative to comprehension, a more challenging
aspect of word learning is a child's ability to produce
new words. In this study, consistently correct responses
to production probes provided evidence that a strong
enough phonological representation of the word was
stored and linked with the correct semantic information to permit the child to retrieve and to produce
the word's lexeme. On average, the NL group learned to
produce three more words than the SLI group, demonstrating that new word production was relatively
difficult for children with SLI. In contrast to comprehension findings, the SLI group learned to produce
more words in the phonological condition than the semantic condition. It was hypothesized that phonological
cues helped the SLI group maintain the new words in
working memory, resulting in the creation of more
stable lexemes. This, in turn, made successful phonological retrieval and production more likely. This
interpretation is similar to that of Demke et al. (2002),
who found that exposure to the phonological neighbor
of a new word after hearing it resulted in increased
correct production.
Although the SLI group learned to produce more
words in the phonological condition than the semantic
condition, phonological cues did not benefit children
to the extent that they learned to produce as many
words as their NL peers. Previous studies (McGregor &
Appel, 2002; McGregor et al., 2002) have posited that
poor naming could be due to poor semantic representation. In this study, the drawing task provided one
means of assessing children's semantic representations
of objects. Because NL and SLI group drawing difference scores did not differ significantly despite poorer

comprehension and production by the SLI group, it
was hypothesized that difficulties with word production might be related more to phonology than to semantics, with the acknowledgment that the two are
not truly separable in this study.
The posttask measures in this study provided an
opportunity to assess children's performance when all
children had received an equal number of exposures to
new words. The groups did not differ significantly in
regard to comprehension or recognition, but the NL
group produced significantly more words than the SLI
group, regardless of condition. These findings support
the hypothesis that phonological storage, retrieval, and
production may present a greater word-learning challenge than semantic storage and retrieval, because
when the word's lexeme was provided or cued as in
the comprehension or recognition tasks, the SLI group
performed as well as the NL group. When children
were required to retrieve and to produce the lexeme,
the SLI group performed significantly poorer than the
NL group.
An interesting outcome of the fast-mapping task
was that between-group differences were significant
for 5-year-olds, but not for 4-year-olds, for both comprehension and production. This suggests that the fastmapping ability of children with NL improves within
this age range, but the fast-mapping ability of children
with SLI may not. Within-group analyses confirmed
that older children with NL had better comprehension
performance than their younger NL counterparts, but
the same pattern was not found for the SLI group. The
results of fast-mapping production are more difficult
to interpret because both groups were near floor performance. Clearly it was difficult for all children to
retrieve and to produce the words when they were presented with four new words in one session and received
only six exposures to each word. It would be interesting to implement the phonological and semantic treatment during fast-mapping to see whether this would
improve performance. Perhaps phonological cues could
help children form initial phonological representations of words, a critical requirement for fast-mapping
success.
As in previous studies (Gray, 2003b, 2004; Kiernan
& Gray, 1998), a number of children from the SLI
group (13 of 24, or 54%) performed as well as their NL
peers, and not all children with NL were normal word
learners (2 of 24, or 8%). Similar to Gray's (2004) study,
poor learners' scores on the Structured Photographic
Expressive Language Test--II were lower than normal
learners' scores, and poor learners scored lower than
normal learners on fast-mapping production. Despite
the significantly different group means, however, poor
learners' scores on these measures would not permit
clinicians to identify them as at-risk learners, because

their scores overlapped with normal learners' scores on
both measures.
Poor learners had more success learning to comprehend names for familiar objects rather than for unfamiliar objects; however, this advantage did not appear
to help them produce these words. These results suggest
that poor learners had an easier time creating a new
lexeme for an existing lemma (new word, familiar object) than creating a new lexeme and a new lemma (new
word, unfamiliar object). This might be attributed to the
additional processing demands required to create both,
and therefore the inability to meet these processing
demands might differentiate normal and poor learners.
This is an interesting question for future study.
It was also the case that poor learners could not
produce words that they could not draw, even if they
comprehended them. This suggests that higher quality
phonological and semantic representation are required
for production than comprehension of new words and
that poor learners had difficulty reaching this level in
the allotted number of exposures. This finding also
suggests that successful retrieval and production of a
lexeme depends to some extent on the quality of semantic representation in its lemma.
In a clinical sense, the performance of poor learners in this study, in relation to Storkel's (2001) research,
suggests that easy-to-learn words will be composed of
common sound sequences that refer to familiar classes
of referents. This should be a consideration when planning vocabulary instruction for children, and one
should realize that more repetition and enrichment
activities may be required for lower frequency words
that refer to objects or concepts that are unfamiliar to
children.
The results of this study suggest that preschoolers
with SLI may benefit from cues that highlight the
phonological or semantic properties of words but that
different cues may aid different aspects of word learning. A future question is whether both types of cues,
used together, would be better than either alone. It
is also important to note that the phonological and
semantic cues in this study comprised several different cue types within each category (e.g., initial sound,
initial syllable or semantic association, superordinate
category). It is not known whether one type of cue or
cue combination would prove more powerful than the
arrays used in this study; therefore, this warrants further investigation. In addition, it is not known whether
cues provided during the first stage of word learning,
fast-mapping, might prove beneficial in helping children learn new words more quickly. The results of this
study indicate, however, that this approach to treatment may prove fruitful for children who have difficulty building their lexicon.
