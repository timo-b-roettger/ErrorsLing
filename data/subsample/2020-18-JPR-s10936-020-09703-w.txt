Abstract
Recent research has suggested that temporal sequencing of narrative events might be a
domain-general ability that underlies oral narrative capacities. The current study investigated this issue in a group of children with known pragmatic and narrative difficulties,
namely Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We hypothesized (1) that children with ASD
(n = 45) would retell narratives of poorer quality than both chronological age-matched
(CAM) children and younger children matched on sentence-level language skills (LM), and
(2) that nonverbal temporal sequencing skills would uniquely predict individual differences
in oral narrative performance in children with ASD. The results show that children with
ASD performed poorer on all measures of oral narrative quality compared with the CAM
group, and on eight of ten measures compared with the LM group. Thus, our first hypothesis was confirmed, suggesting that narrative difficulties in ASD cannot be fully explained
by impaired language. The second hypothesis was only partly confirmed: nonverbal temporal sequencing explained significant or marginally significant variance in some, but not
all, aspects of oral narrative performance of children with ASD. These results are discussed
from theoretical and clinical/educational perspectives, in relation to the heterogeneity of
language skills in ASD and to domain-general features of narrative processing.

Introduction
Storytelling was widespread long before literacy emerged. Narrative ability reflects our
ability to dress our thoughts and experiences in words and to convey events using language
in communicative situations (Bruner 1986). Narrative development starts early in life and
is entangled with cognition, social development, linguistic skills and world knowledge
(Leinonen et al. 2000). Narrative capacity has implications for many aspects of children's
development, such as planning, organizing and sequencing one's thoughts and developing a sense of identity (Berman 2009). Moreover, narrative ability is considered an ecologically valid way of capturing communicative competence in childhood (Botting 2002).
Indeed, narrative ability has shown to predict future communicative functioning and persistent language impairment (Bishop and Edmundson 1987; Norbury and Bishop 2003),
social interaction (Pelletier and Wilde Astington 2004), literacy and reading development
(Cain and Oakhill 1996; Stothard et al. 1998) as well as future academic achievement
(Fazio et al. 1996). In addition, there is a close link between narrative and general pragmatic ability (Reuterskiold Wagner 1999). Thus, narrative capacities are considered to be
an important skill to assess in individuals who experience pragmatic language difficulties,
such as children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (APA 2013; Baixauli et al. 2016;
Bruner and Feldman 1993; Miniscalco et al. 2007). Many children with ASD struggle with
narrative performance (e.g. Baixauli et al. 2016), and a substantial proportion also struggle
with language processing at the level of words and single sentences (e.g. Eigisti et al. 2011;
Tager-Flusberg and Joseph 2003). Currently, it is not entirely clear whether difficulties with
narrating are accounted for by such limitations in language skills at the level of single sentences (henceforth language skills) or if other factors are also involved.
It is methodologically challenging to determine if oral narrative difficulties in children
with ASD is more severe than expected based on their language skills. One procedure has
been to compare ASD children with language-matched comparison groups. There has,
however, been concerns raised that tight group matching can jeopardize the representativeness of the study samples since children with ASD and typically developing children
typically differ in their language skills (Charman 2004). In order to better maintain representativeness, sometimes older children with ASD are matched with younger typically
developing children at the same language level. In a study by Diehl et al. (2006), when
children with and without ASD were matched carefully on age, cognitive abilities, expressive and receptive language abilities children with ASD showed significant impairments
in story coherence but not in story length or syntactic complexity (subordinate clauses)
(Diehl et al. 2006). In another important study, children with ASD created narratives with
shorter and less syntactic complex sentences than younger language matched non-ASD
children (King et al. 2013). A study by Peristeri et al. (2017) compared children with ASD
with high language level (HL), low language level (LL) and non-ASD children matched on
language, age and cognitive abilities. The results showed that the narratives produced by
children with ASD LL had lower syntactic complexity (fewer subordinate clauses) than the
other two groups, while there was no difference between ASD HL and the non-ASD children on the same measure. In the present work, we wish to contribute to the present knowledge on the role of language skills in narrative performance by examining narrative skills
in a population-screened sample of children with ASD and compare with two comparison
groups: carefully matched on language skills and on age.
If, as we hypothesize, the narrative difficulties in ASD cannot be fully explained by
concurrent language difficulties, then additional factors might be involved. One specific

skill of interest in the present paper is nonverbal temporal sequencing. This focus is motivated by recent research suggesting a parallel sequential organisation between oral narrative sequential processing in the oral and visual domains (e.g. Coderre et al. 2018; Cohn
2019). In a previous study, Asberg Johnels et al. (2013), they examined narrative ability
in children with neurodevelopmental disorders and its relation to language skills and to
nonverbal temporal sequencing assessed using the Picture Arrangement Task from WISC
III (Wechsler 1999). In the picture arrangement test, the test leader instructs the child to
arrange a set of coloured pictures in the right order to produce a comprehensible story
without any demands on spoken output (see Fig. 1). Regression analysis suggested that
temporal sequencing, using this test constrained the ability to convey story information
during oral narration independently of language capacity, was important for conveying
story information (Asberg Johnels et al. 2013). This finding, if replicated, has important
clinical/educational and theoretical implications by pointing to the modality independent
nature of narrative processing difficulties. Indeed, from a practical point of view, Coderre
(2019) dismantled the "Visual Ease Assumption", i.e. that visually presented materials is
easier to understand than verbally presented materials in clinical populations, including
children with ASD (Coderre 2019).
Relationships between nonverbal temporal sequencing, listening comprehension
and language development have previously been demonstrated in children without ASD
(Zampini et al. 2017). In the context of ASD, Coderre et al. (2018) compared visual and
linguistic narrative processing in individuals with ASD and demonstrated similar difficulties in both modalities, suggesting a domain-general impairment in narrative comprehension (Coderre et al. 2018). In a similar vein and specifically with regard to narrative production, Asberg Johnels (2018) speculated that temporal sequencing might be a
domain-general ability underlying narrative difficulties, as expressed with pictures or with
words. Perhaps language skills and nonverbal temporal sequencing can be said to constitute
proximal building blocks of narrative performance (`the simple view of narrating') (Asberg
Johnels 2018) in much the same way as decoding and linguistic comprehension are said to
be in reading (`the simple view of reading').
However, there are several limitations in prior research that make such assertions tentative. For instance, Coderre examined narrative comprehension, not production, in ASD,
whereas Asberg Johnels et al. (2013) used a mixed clinical sample, and not just children
with ASD, in their study. Moreover, no comparison groups matched by age or by language
level were included in the latter study. Consequently, we find it important to replicate and
extend previous research using a clinical sample of children with ASD and two non-clinical

comparison groups matched for age and language, respectively. The aim of the present
study was to examine narrative ability in children with and without ASD, and to investigate
to what extent narrative difficulties in children with ASD reflect difficulties with language
and/or nonverbal temporal sequencing.
Our hypotheses were that
1. children with ASD would perform worse on the narrative task compared with both agematched (CAM) and younger language-matched (LM) children.
2. nonverbal temporal sequencing predicts narrative performance in children with ASD
independently of language skills.

Methods
Participants
In total, 45 children (8 girls, 37 boys) ages 5.9-9.8 (mean 7.6) years with ASD were
included in this study. Of these children, 42 (93%) attended mainstream primary schools,
one went to a special needs comprehensive school and two were in preschool. The participating children were recruited from a population-based sample (the AUDIE project) of
N = 129 children who had screened positive for ASD at age 2.5 years in connection with
their child health care centre's routine check-up. The parents of 107 children agreed to have
their child participate in the study (Kantzer et al. 2013, 2018). Of these, 85 children underwent a third follow-up assessment at the child neuropsychiatric clinic (CNC) in Gothenburg approximately 5 years after the first assessment. For various reasons, some of the 85
children were not included in the present study. The attrition included one group of children who either were unable to participate in a formal language assessment (n = 25) or did
not produce the required number of five sentences in the BST assessment (Renfrew 1997;
Svensson and Tuominen-Eriksson 2002) (n = 2). Another two children did not have a result
for Test on Reception Of Grammar-2 (TROG-2) (Bishop 2003, Swedish version 2009) and
were therefore excluded from further analysis, and 11 children were excluded because they
did not meet all criteria for an ASD diagnosis according to clinical consensus based on all
available information from all professionals involved.

Age and Language Matched Groups
Forty-seven children without ASD (17 girls, 30 boys) ages 6.5-9.0 (mean 7.8) years were
recruited from mainstream primary schools in western Sweden, matched by chronological
age (CAM). The language-matched (LM) group consisted of 27 children without ASD (18
girls, 9 boys) ages 3.9-8.6 (mean 6.1) years. They were recruited in the same way as the
CAM group; see Table 1. The children in the LM group were matched according to raw
score results on TROG-2 (Bishop 2003). Those with a standard score of 70 or above were
included; six children were excluded.
Significant differences were found when the groups were compared on raw scores
on TROG-2: H (119) = 32.86, p < 0.01, and Recalling Sentences (CELF-4): H
(118) = 44.10, p < 0.01. No differences between the ASD and LM group were found
on raw scores on TROG-2 (p = 1.0) or Recalling Sentences (p = 0.255) (see Table 1).
The ASD group was outperformed by the age-matched children on both tests (both

p < 0.001). The CAM group had higher raw scores on both tests (p < 0.001) compared
with the LM group, reflecting the fact that typically developing children score higher
with increasing age. Significant differences across the three groups were found on ageadjusted scores of receptive grammar (TROG-2, standard scores) (H[119] = 30.86,
p < 0.01) and Recalling Sentences (scaled scores) (H [113] = 44.01 p < 0.01). The LM
group and the CAM group did not differ significantly on TROG-2 standard scores
(p = 0.197) or on Recalling Sentences scaled scores (p = 0.352). By contrast, the ASD
group was outperformed by both groups on TROG-2 (LM p = 0.01; CAM p =< 0.001)
and Recalling Sentences (both p =< 0.001). There was no difference in age between the
ASD group and the CAM group (p = 1.0).

Procedure
Two speech and language pathologists (SLPs) at the CNC assessed all children with ASD
in connection with the third follow-up assessment, during 1-2 visits to the clinic. Each visit
lasted about 60 min. The first author and two SLP master's students assessed the comparison groups for approximately 45-60 min, with breaks taken if needed, in a separate, quiet
room at their schools.

Material
Narrative Ability
The Bus Story Test (BST) (Renfrew 1997, Swedish version, Svensson and TuominenEriksson 2002) consists of a coloured picture storybook about a `naughty' bus. The test
leader reads the story and then the child is asked to retell the story while looking at the
12 pictures. All stories were audio recorded and orthographically transcribed according to the Swedish manual. The Information score (max = 54), Subordinate Clauses (i.e.
number of produced subordinate clauses) within the retold story, and Sentence Length
(i.e. number of words in the five longest sentences divided by five) were calculated. The
test is standardized for Swedish children in the 3.9-8.5 year age range, which does not
fully cover the age range in the present study. Consequently, the BST results are presented as raw scores. The Narrative Analysis Profile was used for further analysis of the
children's narrative ability on six dimensions: Topic Maintenance, Event Sequencing,
Explicitness, Referencing, Conjunctive Cohesion and Fluency (Bliss et al. 1998). Each
dimension results in a score from 1 to 3, where 1 = inappropriate, 2 = variable (a mix of
appropriate and inappropriate behaviours) and 3 = appropriate. NAP total is a total score
where the score of the six dimensions are added together (min 6-max 18).

Receptive and Expressive Language
Language comprehension (receptive grammar) was assessed with the TROG-2 (Bishop
2003, Swedish version 2009). In TROG-2, the task is to match orally presented sentences with the correct picture out of a choice of four. The results are presented in terms
of both raw scores (number of correctly solved blocks out of a maximum of 20) and
standard scores (M = 100, SD = 15) based on Swedish norms. The Cronbach's alpha is
0.89 in the Swedish manual.
The Recalling Sentences subtest from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4 (CELF-4; Semel et al. 2003, Swedish version 2013) was used as a measure of
language production and expressive language (Klem et al. 2015). Recalling Sentences
consists of 24 sentences. The participant is to repeat each sentence produced by the
test leader, resulting in a score from 0 (> 4 errors) to 3 (no errors). The maximum score
is 72. The results are presented in raw scores and scaled scores (around a normative
M = 10, SD = 3; Swedish norms). The version of the Recalling Sentences subtest from
CELF-4 used in this study was the version used in the standardization of the instrument rather than the final, published version, which includes some revisions of items.
This makes the actual scaled score results a bit uncertain, and they should therefore be
considered as rough estimates. However, it is important to note that both children with
and without ASD were assessed using the same version and that the analyses conducted
were based on raw scores.

Nonverbal Cognitive Ability in the ASD Group
Nonverbal cognitive ability was measured with the Matrix Reasoning subtest from the
Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (Wechsler 1999) (for the children with ASD

13

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2020) 49:475-489

481

only). The results are presented as raw and T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) based on US norms;
no Swedish norms are available.

Nonverbal Temporal Sequencing in the ASD Group
Nonverbal temporal sequencing was assessed using the Picture Arrangement subtest from
WISC-III (Wechsler 1999) for the children with ASD only. The SLP instructed the child to
arrange a set of coloured cartoon pictures (14 sets of 3-5 pictures) into a comprehensible
story (see Fig. 2). The child scored 2 points for arranging a correct set within the assigned
time (age norms) and 3 extra points for speed. After failing three sets, the test was ended.
The results are expressed in scaled scores around the normative mean of 10 (SD  3).

Reliability
The first author calculated the three BST scores for the ASD group. Eleven (24%) of the
BST transcriptions were then re-evaluated by a second independent experienced SLP. To
calculate the reliability, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used (Fleiss 1986).
The inter-rater reliability ranged from excellent to good for all three BST scores: Information (0.97), Sentence Length (0.91) and Subordinate Clauses (0.74) (two-way random,
single measures). Twelve (27%) of the transcripts in the ASD group were re-evaluated by
the first author, and the intra-rater reliability values were found to range from excellent
to good for Information (0.98), Sentence Length (0.90) and Subordinate Clauses (0.78)
(one-way random single measures). Then 14 (19%) of the transcripts from the comparison
groups (LM and CAM combined) were re-evaluated (two-way random, single measures),
and good reliability was found for Information (0.85), Sentence Length (0.89) and Subordinate Clauses (0.82). Overall, the reliability of the data coding appeared to be sufficient. The
NAP analysis was performed on all BST transcriptions by the first author and 26 (22%)
transcriptions of the material were then rated by an independent blinded SLP in order to

calculate inter-rater reliability, which resulted in an ICC of 0.81 (two-way random, single
measures).

Ethics
The study received ethical approval from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg, Sweden (case number 723-13). All parents of the participating children provided oral
and written informed consent.

Statistical Analyses
Non-parametric tests were used for group comparisons (a Kruskal-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons). The significance levels within the group comparisons were adjusted
for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni). The correlations were calculated using Spearman's
rho correlation, and an alpha level was set at p < 0.05. Linear regression analyses were
conducted using forced entry. The correlation between the two variables in the Regression
models were substantially below the "rule of thumb" threshold for multi collinearity (Dormann et al. 2013). IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 was used for computation.

Results
Narrative Ability Comparison Between Groups
Table 1 shows the age, group means, standard deviation and range for all language and narrative tasks for all three groups.
Comparing the BST measures, there were significant differences between the three
groups: Information: H (119) = 28.60, p < 0.01; Sentence Length: H (119) = 56.13,
p < 0.01; Subordinate Clauses: H (119) = 40.10, p < 0.01. Pairwise comparisons showed
that the ASD group performed significantly poorer than the CAM group (p < 0.001) on all
BST scores but at the same level as the LM group on BST Information (p = 1.0) (Fig. 2).
Compared with the LM group, the ASD group performed significantly worse on BST Sentence Length (p < 0.05) and BST Subordinate Clauses (p < 0.05). As expected, the CAM
and LM groups also differed significantly on all three BST scores, with the older children
performing better: Information (p < 0.001), Subordinate Clauses (p < 0.05) and Sentence
Length (p  0.001).
Next, the NAP analyses showed significant group differences for all six dimensions: Topic Maintenance H [118 = 39.96, p < 0.001], Event Sequencing H [118 = 44.29,
p < 0.001], Explicitness H [118 = 46.38, p < 0.001], Referencing H [118 = 23.5, p < 0.001],
Conjunctive cohesion H [118 = 37.14, p < 0.001], Fluency H [118 = 57.86, p < 0.001], and
NAP total H [118 = 52.50, p < 0.001]. For pairwise comparisons, see Table 2. Again, the
ASD group differed significantly compared with both groups for all dimensions except
Referencing, where no significant difference was found compared with the LM group.
Comparing the CAM and LM groups, the older children performed better except that no
group difference was found on Topic Maintenance, Event Sequencing or Fluency.

Correlations Between Language, Narrating and Temporal Sequencing in the Group
of Children with ASD
In order to understand the relationships between narrative ability and other language and
cognitive variables, Spearman's rho correlations were performed. These analyses were
conducted in the ASD group only (since no temporal sequencing data had been collected
for the comparison groups). As shown in Table 3, the results show strong correlations
between all three BST scores, the NAP total and the language variables. There were also
associations between BST scores and nonverbal temporal sequencing.

Predictors of Narrative Skills in the Group of Children with ASD
The next step was to attempt to identify unique predictors of narrative performance using
linear regression analysis. As dependent variables, the NAP total score and the three
measures from the BST were included in separate analyses. Since autism symptomatology was not correlated with the outcome measures, it was not included in the regression
models. The regression analyses were performed in two steps: first we entered age as a
control variable, and in the subsequent step, two more explanatory variables were included,
namely scores on the Recalling Sentences subtest as an index of expressive language at the
sentence level and nonverbal temporal sequencing as per the Picture Arrangement Test.

Together with age, these two independent variables contributed significantly to the regression model for Sentence Length (R2 = 0.49), for Subordinate Clauses (R2 = 0.33), for BST
Information (R2 = 0.54) and for the NAP total score (R2 = 0.41), see Table 4. Recalling
Sentences (i.e. expressive language) was a unique predictor for all BST outcome scores
as well as for the NAP total score (p < 0.01). Nonverbal temporal sequencing was a unique
predictor of Sentence Length (p = 0.003), whereas it fell shy below significance for the

Discussion
The aim of this study was to better understand the nature of narrative difficulties in children
with and without ASD, matched for age and language skills, respectively. Additionally, we
aimed to examine the relation between narrative ability and nonverbal temporal sequencing by identifying explanatory variables for narrative ability in children with ASD using
regression analyses. An important feature of this study is that we recruited participants
from a population-based screening rather than from a pool of clinically referred cases;
hence, the representativeness can be expected to be higher than in prior work on narrative
performance in ASD.
Our first hypothesis was confirmed, i.e. the children with ASD performed worse than
both chronological age-matched children and 2 years younger children matched on tests of
expressive and receptive sentence-level language skills. Compared with the LM group, the
ASD group exhibited significantly poorer performance on the BST, with their narratives
containing shorter sentences and fewer subordinate clauses, suggesting that even though
the groups were matched on language at the sentence level, the ASD group still produced
less syntactically complex narratives. The only exception to this pattern was the BST Information score. When analysing the narratives further using the NAP analysis (Bliss et al.
1998), the group comparisons showed a similar pattern. Our children with ASD performed
worse than the other two groups except for the Referencing score, where the ASD and the
LM group performed at the same level. The Information score from BST and the Referencing score from the NAP likely capture similar abilities, since accurate referencing is important in order to achieve higher scores on BST Information. The NAP analysis comparison between the CAM and LM groups showed further that the younger and older children
without ASD performed at similar levels on certain scores, namely Topic Maintenance,
Event Sequencing, and Fluency, but the older outperformed the younger on Explicitness,
Referencing, Conjunctive Cohesion and the NAP total. This pattern of results shows that
several aspects of narrative development develop during the early school years in typically
developing children.
The group comparisons revealed that language skills do not seem to fully account for
narrative difficulties in ASD, as has indeed been suggested by results in some, but not all,
previous studies. King et al. (2013) compared 12-year-old children with and without ASD
matched on age, language skills and IQ, whereas Peristeri et al. (2017) compared three
groups of 9-year-olds, ASD high language, ASD low language and non-ASD children,
matched for language skills and IQ (Peristeri et al. 2017). Thus, just like we did, both of
these studies found less syntactically complex narratives in children with ASD than in children without ASD. The results in the study by Peristeri et al. (2017), however, showed
that the narratives produced by children with ASD and low language had significantly
lower syntactic complexity (fewer subordinate clauses) than the other two groups, while
there was no difference between ASD high language and the non-ASD children. In contrast, Diehl et al. (2006) found no differences in syntactic complexity between their ASD
and a non-ASD group matched for age, gender, cognitive ability, receptive and expressive
language, while there were significant differences in story coherence between the groups.
Possibly, these differences between studies can be explained by the choice of test material

for assessing narrating. Different test materials require different elicitation methods and
potentially target different aspects of the narrative ability, such as story retelling or story
generation and retention. The age of the child assessed and the representativeness of the
study cohorts are other factors that may impact the results.
Our second hypothesis was only partly confirmed, since the role of nonverbal temporal
sequencing did not consistently explain unique variance in narrative performance in the
children with ASD. Hence, there seems to be an influence of temporal sequencing in oral
narrative performance, but this seems to be contingent on the specific aspect of the narrative output considered. In the regression model, nonverbal temporal sequencing uniquely
predicted individual differences in the Sentence Length BST subscore, and, at trend level,
in the Information subscore (p = 0.06). Regarding the association to temporal sequencing,
we previously argued on theoretical grounds that the Information subscore might mechanistically be more closely associated with temporal sequencing (Asberg Johnels et al.
2013). But it is possible that the Information and Sentence Length subscores are both predicted by temporal sequencing since they collectively reflect comprehension of the original
narrative and the ability to convey critical story elements in a syntactically efficient and
correct manner (Renfrew 1997). In the future, these nature of the associations should be
unravelled in greater detail, and attention should be given also to learning what specific
abilities and functions are needed in order to solve the Picture Arrangement Task (Happe
and Frith 2006; Language and Reading Research Consortium 2015; Marini et al. 2010;
Zampini et al. 2017). In particular, an important task for the future would be to elucidate
the associations between nonverbal temporal sequencing and other ASD-relevant cognitive
skills, such as theory of mind, central coherence and executive functions (Happe and Frith
2006), and how these act as explaining factors for narrative performance.
Certain features of this study are potential weaknesses: First, we only assessed temporal sequencing in the ASD group and not in the two comparison groups; this choice was
practical rather than theoretical and reflected time constraints at the schools. Another possible limitation of our study is that we used only one narrative cartoon task. The BST was
chosen since it has been shown that retelling stories is suitable both for preschool children
(Westerveld and Vidler 2015) and for older children with cognitive disabilities, as they
on average produce longer and grammatically more complex narratives in story retelling
narratives than in self-generated stories, where floor effects are common (Boudreau 2008;
Merrit and Liles 1989). Interestingly, however, a recent review has in fact shown weak evidence of the common assumption that pictorial processing is a `strength' in clinical populations, including autism (Coderre 2019). Instead, Coderre warns that more thorough consideration of the cognitive complexities in visual narrative processing is needed, and that it
is not evident that narrative processing will become easier by merely adding visual stimuli
(Coderre 2019). It could also depend on how the material is presented, verbally, in text
or visually, and there might also be different patterns across development (Manfredi et al.
2020). An important avenue for future research is to examine how the choice of material
and elicitation technique affects narrative performance in ASD and whether the predictors
of narrative performance differ as a function of assessment method.
To summarize, in this study we have evidence for the hypothesis that children with ASD
perform poorer on narrating than both younger language- and age-matched typically developing children. Moreover, we find partial evidence for our second hypothesis that, besides
language skills, nonverbal temporal sequencing plays a role in narrative performance. Poor
performance on this task might be taken as a proxy for weak central coherence (Happe and
Frith 2006) or/and an index of a domain general deficit in narrative sequential reasoning
(Coderre et al. 2018; Cohn 2014, 2019). It would be of interest to further investigate the

skills and capacities that underlie nonverbal temporal sequencing and how they manifest
in oral narration. Such insights could further theoretical development and have a potential
impact on the design of interventions targeting narrative ability in children with ASD.
