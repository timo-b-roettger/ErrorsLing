ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

We report ERP evidence for local (preceding sentence) and global (thematic centrality) influences
on word-to-text integration. Helder et al. (2019) found that the preceding sentence, rather than
the central theme, is the primary source of integration, indexed by the N400 on the sentenceinitial noun. The present experiments add evidence for thematic centrality effects. In Experiment
1, an N400 reduction occurred on the sentence-initial noun when an antecedent was remotely
positioned in the preceding sentence and referred to the central theme, relative to Baseline.
Experiment 2 further encouraged thematic processing by having participants select passage
titles, producing an N400 reduction for sentence-initial nouns related to the central theme.
Sentence-final nouns showed local influence on the N400 and P600, with no effect of centrality.
We conclude that thematic centrality can influence integration across a sentence boundary
when the antecedent is less accessible and the reader's task encourages attention to global
structure.

In constructing mental representations of text meaning
(Van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983), readers integrate the meanings of words, phrases, and clauses as they are read
into their understanding of the text. These integration
processes are incremental and very rapid, detectable at
the word level in self-paced reading (Boland et al.,
1995), eye-movements (Rayner et al., 1989), and Event
Related Potentials; ERPs (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980) and are
part of the foundation of fluid reading comprehension
(Perfetti & Stafura, 2014).
These integrative processes involve text influences
from local text structures, at minimum the sentence in
which the word occurs (e.g. Frazier & Clifton, 1996; MacDonald et al., 1994), and global text structures, such as
the topic, thematic and causal structures of the text as
a whole (e.g. Graesser & Clark, 1985; Trabasso & van
den Broek, 1985). The issue of whether global text
factors (e.g. the central theme of a text), beyond local
text factors (preceding sentence), can influence the integration of single words into text memory is addressed in
two ERP studies by Helder et al. (2019).
A particular feature of the experimental paradigm in
these studies is that it separates text influence from sentence influence by measuring ERPs on the first substantive word (the noun of a subject noun phrase) across a

sentence boundary. Thus, any integrative effects
indexed by ERPs are attributable to the preceding text
and not the sentence in which the word occurs.
In an example passage from Helder et al. (2019) (see
Table 1) the final sentence "The rain ruined her beautiful
sweater" was preceded by " ... it started to storm.", providing a local binding opportunity for the critical word
at the beginning of the sentence ("rain"). The sentence
with the local binding opportunity was preceded by
two sentences that set up the global context of the
passage; in one condition, Local binding + Central
theme, the critical word ("rain") was related to the
central theme of the passage ("weather"), in the other
condition, Local binding only, the same critical word
was presented in a passage in which the critical word
was less related to the central theme ("clothes").
To test whether the local context influenced word-totext integration at sentence beginnings, ERPs in
response to critical words were compared between passages with a local binding opportunity and Baseline passages without a binding opportunity. To test whether the
global factor of thematic centrality had an additional
influence on word-to-text integration, ERPs were compared between critical words that were related to the
central theme of the passage or not. The results were

(1) an N400 reduction on the critical word ("rain"), relative
to baseline, for the two conditions that had a local
binding site ("it started to storm") in the preceding sentence and (2) no additional reduction of the N400
when the local binding site was related to the central
theme. Helder et al. (2019) concluded that, for words at
the beginning of a sentence, local influences were dominant and the central theme had no additional influence
on integrating the word into the text representation.
On the assumption that certain text and reading task
factors may be important in the emergence of thematic
effects at sentence beginnings, we carried out and report
below two experiments designed to enhance the
influence of global text structures on word-to-text integration. Before we explain the rationale for these experiments, we review some of the key background issues.

Contextual effects in word processing
It is clear that online word processing is influenced by the
context provided by the text beyond the sentence in
which the word occurs, as evidenced in both ERP (e.g. Ferretti et al., 2008; Kuperberg et al., 2011; Nieuwland & Van
Berkum, 2006; StGeorge et al., 1994; van Berkum et al.,
1999) and eye tracking studies (e.g. Filik, 2008; Kambe
et al., 2001; Pickering & Traxler, 1998; Warren et al.,
2008). Using the ERP word-to-text integration paradigm
(Yang et al., 2007), previous studies show that integration
across sentences can occur at least at the meaning level
and perhaps at the situation-model level (Van Dijk &
Kintsch, 1983). That is, although word-to-word lexicalsemantic associations produce N400 reductions, the
word-to-text integration effects reflect additional textmeaning processes (Stafura et al., 2015; Stafura & Perfetti,
2014). Thus, the word-to-text integration paradigm allows
the capture, across sentence boundaries, of both local and
global text influences on reading single words.
In ERP studies, contextual effects on word processing
are often captured by modulations of the N400

component, a negative going deflection that peaks
around 400 ms after the onset of a critical word. Partly
because it is pervasive in language processing, the
N400 has been subject to various interpretations supported by substantial evidence. On one interpretation,
N400 context effects reflect the congruence of the
meaning of a word with the meaning of the text, consistent with an integration process (e.g. Hagoort et al., 2004;
Stafura & Perfetti, 2014; van Berkum et al., 1999).
However, the N400 has become increasingly interpreted
as reflecting predictive processes (e.g. Kuperberg &
Jaeger, 2016; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; van Berkum
et al., 2005; Van Petten & Luka, 2012) that either
produce a specific word that later occurs or activate
semantic features that overlap with the meaning of an
upcoming word. A third interpretation, also with substantial evidence, is that the N400 does not reflect integrative processing at all, but instead indexes the
retrieval of word meaning (Brouwer et al., 2012).
Brouwer et al review evidence implicating the P600 as
reflecting integration or updating of prior information.
Within the tradition that views the N400 as a marker of
integration, there is increasing recognition that a simple
"either-or" account (prediction or memory-based integration) fails to capture the multiple components of integrative processes (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). Indeed, as
argued by Calloway and Perfetti (2017), memory-based
integration and prediction as semantic activation are
two complementary perspectives on a single underlying
process. When a word is read, its meaning interacts with
a multi-leveled associative memory that includes
meaning features from prior text and non-text knowledge
sources during the early construction phase of word processing (Kintsch, 1988). From the position of the prior text,
such processes prepare for the integration of meaning
features that occurs when a later word is read. From the
position of the word currently being read, these processes
provide information in memory to support integration.
Still, even on this more unitary interpretation, it is possible
that distinct aspects of ERP shifts in the N400 window (e.g.
the rising and falling segments of the N400 wave form)
can distinguish the predictive and memory-based
aspects of the overall integration process (Nieuwland
et al., 2020), at least when texts produce a strong expectation for specific words.
The present study focuses on words at the beginning
of a sentence, where word-specific prediction is unlikely
and where previous research supports a memory-based
integration account over a word-specific prediction
account (Calloway & Perfetti, 2017; Stafura et al., 2015).
Prior activation of semantic features that overlap with
the meaning of the word across the boundary remains
a possibility.

Sentence beginnings versus sentence endings.
The word-to-text integration processes depend on the
structural role of the word within a particular sentence
(e.g. Frazier & Clifton, 1996; MacDonald et al., 1994). A
word is integrated into its (multiple) syntactic structures
and a word at the end of a clause or sentence closes multiple open structures, including the clause or sentence as
a whole. Thus, to integrate a word at the end of a sentence, integrative processes must link the word to the
local sentence structures, providing contextual constraints that facilitate predictive and integrative processes. In contrast, at the beginning of a sentence, the
reader uses the first word to open a new initial structure,
often a noun phrase. Because the processing obligation
is to build a new structure, integration with preceding
text is not required. However, integration with the preceding text can occur when the word that is being
read triggers retrieval of an antecedent word or phrase
in text memory whose referential meaning binds with
the meaning of the word being read. Thus, building a
new structure is the default operation at sentence beginnings, making integration a process that occurs only
when the word being read prompts retrieval of a text
memory.

The current study
As we noted, the results of Helder et al. (2019) indicated
that local context influences word-to-text integration
across a sentence boundary and that no further
influence is exerted by the global factor of thematic centrality (Experiment 1). Further, adding a title to the texts
to strengthen centrality had no effect (Experiment 2).
These results suggest that integration across a sentence
boundary, when it occurs, is driven by local context.
However, it is possible that factors associated with the
text or the reader influence whether global effects are
observed. For example, one factor may be that longer
texts may establish a more prominent central theme
than the short passages of Helder et al. (2019). A
second factor may be the accessibility of a local
binding site. If the potential binding site is recent in
the text, as it was in Helder et al. (2019) where it occurred
at the end of the preceding sentence, this local binding
site will be highly accessible in memory during the
reading of the word across the sentence boundary. Its
linkage establishes local coherence, leaving little
chance for an additional global effect. Making the local
binding site less accessible by placing it earlier in the preceding sentence should allow the central theme to
enhance the accessibility of the local binding site. A
third factor concerns the reader's goal, which was to

1241

answer true-false comprehension questions in Helder
et al. (2019). This task may lead readers to attend more
narrowly the facts conveyed in sentences, again reducing the opportunity for global influences. We chose to
address the last two of these three possibilities in the
experiments reported below.
In Experiment 1, we tested whether a thematic centrality effect would emerge at sentence-initial nouns
when the local binding opportunity in the preceding
sentence is located in the first part of the preceding sentence, farther away from the critical word. Making the
local binding opportunity more remote should make it
less accessible in memory, thus allowing the central
theme to enhance its accessibility. Retrieval of the
meaning of the relevant text segment (the local
binding opportunity) produces integration with the
meaning of the critical sentence-initial noun. If so, a
reduced N400 on the critical sentence-initial noun will
reflect this integration process, compared with a baseline
that provides no obvious local binding opportunity.
Moreover, by making the local binding opportunity less
accessible, the central theme may now show its
influence on word-to-text integration. If so, we expect a
greater N400 reduction for nouns that are related to
the central theme of the passage than for nouns that
are not. Integration effects are sometimes observed in
the late positivity or P600 component (Brouwer et al.,
2012), including semantic processes that update the
reader's mental model of the text (Burkhardt, 2007; Schumacher, 2014; Schumacher & Hung, 2012), although
semantic effects also may arise from meaning relations
extracted from syntactic structures (Bornkessel-Schlesewsky & Schlesewsky, 2008). Because of its interpretation as reflecting higher level integration, we tested
the P600 as well.
In Experiment 2, we further encouraged global integration by changing the task instruction. Instead of
answering true/false comprehension questions after
each passage, Experiment 2 required participants to
choose which of two titles best fits the passage they
just read. This title selection task should encourage
readers to attend to global meaning features and may
allow the emerge of a thematic centrality effect on the
N400 or the P600.
For critical sentence-final nouns in both experiments
our expectations are less clear. The two experiments of
Helder et al. (2019) showed N400 and P600 reductions
for sentence-final nouns that were related to the
central theme relative to nouns that were not related
to the central theme, possibly reflective of integrative
(N400) and updating (P600) processes. However, the sentence-final nouns in those experiments contrasted only
on whether they were related to the central theme;

1242

unlike for the first word across a sentence boundary,
there was no local binding opportunity for the textfinal word. Thus, those experiments show a thematic
centrality effect on the sentence-final nouns in the
absence of any local binding opportunity. In the
present experiments, the sentence-final nouns have a
local binding opportunity in the preceding sentence,
making possible a direct comparison between sentence-final nouns with and without local binding opportunity as well as with or without a relation to the central
theme. If the global text factor of thematic centrality has
an influence on the integration of sentence-final nouns, a
reduced N400 or P600 is more likely to be observed for
sentence-final nouns that are related to the central
theme than for sentence-final nouns that are not
related to the central theme.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants. Thirty-eight participants (ages 18-36) were
recruited through their responses to flyers posted on the
campus of the University of Pittsburgh. All were native
English speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal
vision and were right handed with no history of head
injuries, neurological disorders or learning disabilities.
The data of two participants were discarded because of
technical problems during data collection. After preprocessing the EEG data, the data of three additional
participants were discarded because of artefacts arising
from excessive blinking, eye movements, and faulty electrodes. Thus, data from 33 participants (19 female, Mage

= 21.55; SD = 3.75) were available for ERP analyses. All
procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Review Board. All participants
received $10 per hour for their participation.
Materials. Each participant read 90 four-sentence passages that were preceded by a title using the same procedures as in Helder et al. (2019): ERPs were measured on
two words of the final sentence: the noun at the sentence-initial position and the noun at the sentencefinal position. The central theme was established in the
first three sentences of the passage by explicitly referring
to the central theme twice and by including three words
within the first three sentences that were semantically
related to the central theme. The title contains another
explicit mention of the central theme. In contrast to
Helder et al. (2019), the local binding opportunity for
nouns at the beginning of the fourth sentence now
appeared at the first part of the preceding sentence,
rather than near the end, making it less accessible at
the point where the critical noun of the next sentence
occurs.1 The number of words between the critical
noun and the binding opportunity ranges from 4-16
words with an average of 9 (SD = 3). Finally, nouns in
the sentence-final position had a binding opportunity
at the end of the preceding sentence, something that
was not controlled for in the materials of Helder et al.
(2019). See Table 2 for two examples.
The sentence-initial noun of the final sentence was the
same across the three conditions for a given passage.
These conditions varied according to the opportunity
the third sentence presented for integration of this sentence-initial noun, defined as in Helder et al. (2019): (1)

initial noun has a binding opportunity in the preceding
sentence that is related to the central theme of the
passage; e.g. the sentence-initial noun "pictures" could
trigger the retrieval of the binding opportunity in the preceding sentence ("photos") and, additionally, is related to
the central theme "photographer". (2) Local Binding +
Non Central (LB + NC). The critical sentence-initial noun
has the same binding opportunity in the preceding sentence, but is unrelated to the central theme of the
passage; e.g. the sentence-initial noun "pictures" could
trigger the retrieval of the binding opportunity in the preceding sentence ("photos"), but occurs in a passage with
"food critic" as the central theme. (3) Baseline condition.
The critical sentence-initial noun "pictures" has no direct
binding opportunity and occurs in a passage that is
equal in length to the LB + C and LB + NC conditions.
The same logic applies to the critical sentence-final
nouns. Depending on condition, the critical sentencefinal noun ("desserts") has (1) a binding opportunity in
the preceding sentence ("food") and is related to the
central theme "food critic" (LB + C), (2) this same
binding opportunity in the preceding sentence but
occurs in passage with "photographer" as the central
theme, (LB + NC) or (3) has no obvious binding opportunity in the preceding sentence (Baseline) and is equal in
length to the LB + C and LB + NC conditions.
To assess our local and global text manipulations,
we measured the lexical-semantic relationship
between the critical nouns and the local (preceding
sentence) and global (all words before the critical
noun) context. Table 3 shows Latent Semantic Analyses
(LSA) values for both sentence-initial and sentencefinal nouns, confirming our local and global text
manipulations.
Three separate lists of 30 passages per condition were
created so that each subject saw only one condition of
each of the 90 passages. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of the three lists.
Sentence-initial noun. The first critical word ("pictures") appeared at the beginning of the final sentence
where ERP's were measured and compared across
three conditions: (1) LB + C (local binding opportunity:
"photos", central theme: "photographer"), (2) LB + NC
(local binding opportunity: "photos", central theme:
"food critic") and (3) Baseline.
First, to test whether the critical word cues the retrieval
of the local binding opportunity presented at the beginning of the preceding sentence, mean amplitudes on sentence-initial nouns were compared between LB + NC and
Baseline. Second, to test whether the global context of the
central theme influences word-to-text integration, mean
amplitudes on sentence-initial nouns were compared
between LB + C and LB + NC.

Sentence-final noun. The second critical word ("desserts") appeared at the end of the final sentence where
ERP's were measured and compared across three conditions: (1) LB + C (local binding opportunity: "food",
central theme: "food critic"), (2) LB + NC (local binding
opportunity: "food", central theme: "photographer")
and (3) Baseline.
As for the sentence-initial nouns, local binding effects
were tested by comparing mean amplitudes on sentence-final nouns in LB + NC to those in Baseline. To
test for an effect of the central theme, mean amplitudes
on sentence-final nouns were compared between LB + C
and LB + NC.
Norming study sentence-initial nouns. Two separate norming studies were conducted to obtain a
measure of integrability and cloze-based predictability
(as defined in Calloway & Perfetti, 2017) of the sentence-initial critical nouns of our materials. For both
norming studies, three lists were created in a Qualtrics
survey with 30 items in the baseline condition and 30
items in the local binding condition so that every participant saw 60 items, consisting of the beginning of the
final sentence and the preceding sentence of each of
the experimental passages. Note that the sentence preceding the critical sentence-initial word is the same for
LB + C and LB + NC conditions. Native English-speaking
participants living in the United States were recruited
through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
Integrability scores. Each participant (N = 87) saw
each sentence-initial noun and the preceding sentence
(e.g. Chuck grabbed a double espresso before entering
the classroom because he knew his students would be

word with the preceding sentence?" on a 7-point Likert
scale ranging from Very Easy (1) through Very Difficult
(7). Average integrability scores displayed in Table 4
show that nouns with a local binding opportunity are
easier to integrate than the same words in the baseline
condition.
Predictability scores. Each participant (N = 89) saw
the sentence and the article preceding each sentenceinitial noun, and was instructed to "please try to
predict the next word in the sentence". The predictability
scores (averaged across participants and items; see Table
4) show that predictability of sentence-initial nouns is
low overall, although higher in the local binding condition (4%) than the baseline (1%).
Procedure. The procedure was the same as in Helder
et al. (2019). Participants were fitted with an EEG net
and seated inside a soundproof, electrically insulated
booth on an adjustable chair 60 cm from the center
of a 15-in. (38.1 cm) CRT display. They were instructed
to read text passages for comprehension and to make
true/false judgements to statements that followed each
passage. All materials were presented in white letters
on a black background, font Arial size 16, using Eprime (Version 2.0; Psychology Software Tools, Inc.
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Each trial began with a fixation
cross displayed for 350 ms. The title and the first two
sentences were then displayed as full sentences; after
reading the first sentence, the participant pressed the
spacebar to replace it with the second sentence. The
third and fourth sentences were presented one word
at the time with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of
300 ms and a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of
600 ms. True/false statements were designed to be
easy to answer when the reader attended to the
content of the passage. Immediate feedback was presented on the screen after each trial, either by "good
job" for correct responses or "wrong" for incorrect
responses.
The passages were presented in three blocks of 30
randomly ordered passages with short breaks between
blocks. To ensure participants understood the task
instructions, three practice trials preceded the

experimental trials. The experiment took around 60
minutes to complete.
ERP recordings and preprocessing. All preprocessing
steps were the same for critical sentence-initial and sentence-final nouns and follow the procedure described in
Helder et al. (2019). ERP recordings were made from a
128 electrode Geodesic sensor net (Tucker, 1993) with
Ag/AgCl electrodes (Electrical Geodesics, Inc., Eugene,
OR) with impedances kept below 40 k (Ferree et al.,
2001) and a vertex reference during the recording. The
EEG signals were digitally sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz,
and hardware filtered during recording between 0.1
and 200 Hz.
A 30 Hz low-pass finite impulse response filter was
applied to the recorded EEGs, which were segmented
into 1000 ms ERP epochs from 200 ms before the onset
of the critical noun to 800 ms after. Automatic artefact
detection removed segments on the basis of blink detection on superior and inferior eye channels that showed
voltage fluctuations of > 140 V; horizontal eye movements (e.g. saccades) were detected at the left outer
canthi electrode and removed for voltage fluctuations
of > 55 V. For sentence-initial nouns, this procedure
lead to the exclusion of 6.97% (SD = 6.84%) of trials in
the LB + C condition, 6.67% (SD = 6.12%) in the LB + NC
condition, and 6.87% (SD = 6.61%) in the Baseline condition. For sentence-final nouns, 5.96% (SD = 5.64%) of
trials were excluded in the LB + C condition, 5.56% (SD
= 6.38%) in the LB + NC condition, and 6.16% (SD =
5.96%) in the Baseline condition. Finally, datasets were
visually inspected for any remaining bad channels.
Channels removed because of artefacts were replaced
by data from neighbouring channels using spherical
spline interpolation (Ferree, 2006). The data were then
re-referenced to the average of all channels, as is
common with dense-array electrode nets2 (Dien, 1998;
Luck, 2014) and then averaged for each participant for
each condition. A baseline correction was applied to
the averaged waveforms by subtracting the mean amplitude of the baseline period (200 ms before critical words)
from each sample in the segment. The data were then
exported to EPToolkit v2.63 (Dien, 2010) and SPSS 24.0
for statistical analyses.

Results
Behavioural data. Accuracy on the true/false statements
that followed each passage was high, with an average of
95.72% (SD = 2.75%) across conditions.
ERP data. For measurements on the critical sentenceinitial noun and sentence-final noun, mean amplitudes
between 300 and 500 ms (N400) and between 500 and
700 ms (P600) following word onset were averaged

across participants. These time windows were based on
previous ERP text research (e.g. Burkhardt, 2007; Helder
et al., 2019) and confirmed by inspection of peak
latencies. Mean amplitudes for all participants were compared in two repeated measures ANOVAs: the first was a
3 (Condition; LB + C, LB + NC, Baseline) x 3 (Cluster; Fz, Cz,
Pz), referred to as midline analysis. The second was a 3
(Condition; LB + C, LB + NC, Baseline) x 2 (Cluster laterality; F3/C3/P3, F4/C4/P4) x 3 (Cluster posteriority; F3/F4,
C3/C4, P3/P4), referred to as laterality analysis. Figure 1
shows the electrodes used for each cluster.
We report significant main effects and/or interactions
of condition with electrode cluster. When a main effect
of condition was significant, we conducted two planned
comparisons: (1) to test for local binding effects on sentence-initial nouns, mean amplitudes were compared
between LB + NC and Baseline; (2) to test for global
text influences (i.e. thematic centrality) on word-to-text
integration, mean amplitudes were compared between
LB + C and LB + NC. When there was no significant
difference between LB + C and LB + NC, we did a posthoc comparison of LB + C vs Baseline to test whether
a condition that had both local binding and thematic
centrality produced an effect compared with a condition that had neither. These same comparisons were
applied to the mean amplitudes on sentence-final
nouns. Greenhouse-Geisser corrected p-values are
reported when sphericity could not be assumed.

Sentence-initial nouns
N400 analyses. Neither the local binding opportunity
nor thematic centrality produced a reliable N400 effect:
LB + NC elicited reduced negativity relative to Baseline
and LB + C elicited reduced negativity relative to LB +
NC, but these comparisons did not reach significance.
Sentence-initial nouns that had a local binding opportunity and were related to the central theme (LB + C) did
produce a reduced N400, but only relative to Baseline
and not compared with local binding only (LB + NC).
These conclusions are based on the following analyses.
Midline analyses (Fz, Cz, Pz). A significant interaction of
condition with electrode cluster, F(4, 128) = 3.71, p = .029,
p = .10 indicated significant condition differences at
parietal electrodes, Pz, F(2,64) = 4.49, p = .018, p = .12,
but not at Cz, F(2,64) = 1.81, p = .172 and Fz, F(2,64) =
2.64, p = .103. At Pz there was no local binding effect;
the N400 was reduced for LB + NC [M = -1.27V; 95% CI
(-1.77, -.76)] relative to Baseline [M = -1.53V; 95%
(-2.08, -.97)], but not reliably (p = .196). There was also
no effect of the central theme. However, an N400
reduction for LB + C [M = -.82V; 95% CI (-1.28, -.36)] relative to LB + NC is visible in Pz, but did not reach standard
reliability (p = .087).
A post-hoc comparison of LB + C vs Baseline indicated
N400 reductions for nouns that had a local binding
opportunity and were related to the central theme (LB
+ C), relative to Baseline, p = .011.
Laterality analyses (F3, C3, P3, F4, C4, P4). As in the
midline analyses, a significant interaction of condition
with cluster posteriority, F(4, 128) = 3.77, p = .027, p
= .11 indicated significant condition differences at parietal electrodes, P3/P4, F(2, 64) = 5.25, p = .008, p = .14,
but not at C3/C4, F(2,64) = 1.18, p = .314 and F3/F4,
F(2, 64) = 1.94, p = .152. At P3/P4 there was no local
binding effect; the N400 was reduced for LB + NC [M
= -.72V; 95% CI (-1.03, -.41)] relative to Baseline [M
= -.95V; 95% CI (-1.34, -.56)], but not reliably (p = .110).
There was also no effect of the central theme. The
expected N400 reduction for LB + C [M = -.40V; 95% CI
(-.72, -.08)] relative to LB + NC is visible in parietal electrodes, but did not reach standard reliability (p = .084).
A post-hoc comparison of LB + C and Baseline indicated an N400 reduction for LB + C relative to Baseline,
p = .006.

Sentence-final nouns
N400 analyses. The local binding opportunity in the
preceding sentence produced an N400 effect: LB + NC
elicited a reduced N400 relative to Baseline. The thematic centrality (LB + C vs LB + NC) did not have an
effect. These conclusions are based on the following
analyses.
Midline analyses (Fz, Cz, Pz). A significant interaction of
condition with electrode cluster, F(4, 128) = 3.74, p = .025,
p = .11 indicated significant condition differences at
central electrodes, Cz, F(2, 64) = 4.01, p = .023, p = .11
and parietal electrodes, Pz, F(2, 64) = 4.18, p = .020, p
= .12, but not at frontal electrodes, Fz, F(2, 64) = 1.78, p
= .176. There was a local binding effect at Cz: LB + NC
[M = .92V; 95% CI (.39, 1.45)] showed N400 reductions
relative to Baseline [M = .30V; 95% CI (-.10, .89)], p
= .023, as well as at Pz: LB + NC [M = 1.38V; 95% CI
(.92, .23)] > Baseline [M = .57V; 95% CI (-.03, 1.16)], p
= .030. There was no effect of the central theme: LB + C
and LB + NC showed no significant differences at either
Cz (LB + C, [M = .99V; 95% CI (.44, 1.53)], LB + NC [M

= .92V; 95% CI (.39, 1.45)], p = .794) or Pz (LB + C, [M =
1.19V; 95% CI (.57, 1.80)], LB + NC [M = 1.38V; 95% CI
(.92, .23)], p = .559).
A post-hoc comparison of LB + C and Baseline at Cz
indicated N400 reduction for LB + C relative to Baseline,
p = .006. This was also the case at Pz, LB + C showed
N400 reductions relative to Baseline, p = .007.
Laterality analyses (F3, C3, P3, F4, C4, P4). A main
effect of condition, F(2,64) = 3.83, p = .027, p = .11
was qualified by an interaction of condition with
cluster posteriority, F(4, 128) = 4.74, p = .009, p = .13.
This interaction indicated significant condition differences at central electrodes, C3/C4, F(2, 64) = 4.95, p
= .010, p = .134 and parietal electrodes, P3/P4, F(2,
64) = 8.03, p = .001, p = .201, but not at frontal electrodes, F3/F4, F(2, 64) = 1.25, p = .292. There was a local
binding effect at C3/C4: LB + NC [M = .58V; 95% CI
(.26, .89)] showed N400 reductions relative to Baseline
[M = .16V; 95% CI (-.12, .43)], p = .041, as well as at
P3/P4: LB + NC [M = 1.00V; 95% CI (.75, 1.25)] > Baseline [M = .39V; 95% CI (.04, .74)], p = .001. There was
no effect of the central theme: LB + C and LB + NC
showed no significant differences at either C3/C4 (LB
+ C [M = .47V; 95% CI (.19, .76)], LB + NC [M = .58V;
95% CI (.26, .89)], p = .472) or P3/P4 (LB + C [M = .92V;
95% CI (.58, 1.25)], LB + NC [M = 1.00V; 95% CI (.75,
1.25)], p = .654).

Figure 3. Grand average wave forms for critical sentence-final nouns in local binding + central (LB + C), local binding only (LB + NC),
and baseline conditions in Experiment 1. The data is re-referenced to the average of all channels. Negativity is plotted downwards.
Pairwise comparisons show significant condition differences in the N400 time window at central and parietal clusters (Cz/C3/C4, Pz/
P3/P4): N400 effect for the local binding comparison (LB + NC > Baseline); no thematic centrality effect (LB + C vs LB + NC); N400
reduction for LB + C relative to Baseline. Pairwise comparisons show significant condition differences in the P600 time window
across all clusters, visible in left central and frontal electrodes: P600 effect for the local binding comparison (Baseline > LB + NC
(midline clusters only)); no thematic centrality effect (LB + C vs LB + NC); larger P600 for Baseline relative to LB + C.

A post-hoc comparison of LB + C and Baseline at C3/
C4 indicated N400 reduction for LB + C relative to Baseline, p = .004. This was also the case at P3/P4, LB + C
showed N400 reductions relative to Baseline, p = .001.
P600 analyses. Sentence-final nouns in the baseline condition produced more positivity in the P600 time window
than the same nouns with a local binding opportunity
(LB + NC), mostly visible in left central and frontal electrodes.
The central theme (LB + C vs LB + NC) did not have an effect.
These conclusions are based on the following analyses.
Midline analyses (Fz, Cz, Pz). A main effect of condition,
F(2, 64) = 3.83, p = .027, p = .107 indicated a local
binding effect: the P600 was more positive for Baseline
[M = 1.58V; 95% CI (1.21, 1.95)] than for LB + NC [M =
1.25V; 95% CI (.77, 1.73)], p = .040, mostly visible at Fz.
There was no effect of the central theme: LB + C [M =
1.17V; 95% CI (.79, 1.55)] and LB + NC showed no significant differences, p = .636.
A post-hoc comparison of LB + C and Baseline at all
midline clusters indicated that the P600 was more positive for Baseline relative to LB + C, p = .009.
Laterality analyses (F3, C3, P3, F4, C4, P4). A main effect
of condition, F(2, 64) = 3.31, p = .043, p = .09 indicated a

local binding effect: the P600 is visible in left central and
frontal electrodes and was more positive for Baseline [M
= .90V; 95% CI (.67, 1.12)] than for LB + NC [M = .73V;
95% CI (.44, 1.01)], but did not reach standard reliability,
p = .084. There was no effect of the central theme: LB + C
[M = .64V; 95% CI (.43, .85)] and LB + NC showed no significant differences, p = .419.
A post-hoc comparison of LB + C and Baseline at all
laterality clusters indicated that the P600 was more positive for Baseline than for LB + C, p = .021.

Discussion
The results of Experiment 1 suggest that the N400 local
binding effect at the sentence-initial nouns was weak
in the absence of centrality; the differences between
LB + NC and Baseline were in the expected direction,
but did not reach standard significance for parietal clusters. The effect of centrality was also weak, significantly
different from the baseline, but not from local binding
only (LB-NC).
In Helder et al. (2019), the local binding antecedent
was positioned at the end of the preceding sentence.
In the present experiment, the accessibility of the local

1248

A. HELDER ET AL.

binding antecedent may have been weakened by its
more remote positioning near the beginning of the preceding sentence. When this antecedent was related to
the central theme, its accessibility could have been
enhanced, allowing an N400 reduction relative to baseline. Thus, the effects of thematic centrality and local
binding were sufficient in combination for an integration
effect on the N400.
Sentence-final nouns with a local binding opportunity
in the preceding sentence showed reduced negativity in
the N400 time window relative to sentence-final nouns
that had no such binding opportunity, reflecting the
retrieval and binding of text information upon reading
the critical noun. Additionally, a more positive left
central and frontal P600 for sentence-final nouns in the
baseline condition, compared with both LB + C and LB
+ NC, suggests that final integrative processes (closure
and updating) were facilitated by the binding opportunity of the preceding sentence. As was the case for sentence-initial nouns, thematic centrality (LB + C) was not
significantly different from local binding only (LB + NC).

Experiment 2
The goal of the second experiment was to stimulate the
use of global context (the central theme) in word-to-text
integration by influencing participants' reading goals. To
do so, we used the same materials and procedure as
Experiment 1, but with a different task: Instead of
asking true/false comprehension questions after each
passage, participants were asked to pick which of two
titles better fits with each passage. With these instructions, we aimed to influence the reader's focus on the
central theme of the passage.

Method
Participants. Thirty-nine participants (ages 18-30) were
drawn from the same population and meeting the
same criteria as the first experiment: English speakers,
right-handed, with normal or corrected-to-normal
vision and without a history of head injuries, neurological
disorders or learning disabilities. Two participants did not
finish the experiment. After preprocessing the EEG data,
the data of seven participants were discarded because of
excessive blinking, eye movements, or faulty electrodes.
Thus, data from 30 participants (20 female, Mage = 20.88;
SD = 2.51) were available for ERP analyses. All procedures
were approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Review Board. All participants received $10 per
hour for their participation.
Materials and procedure. The materials consisted of the
same 90 four-sentence passages as used in Experiment

1. However, in Experiment 2 we implicitly orient participants toward the central theme of the passage by
asking, after each passage, which of two titles fits
better for that passage. For the LB + C and LB + NC conditions we used the titles that were presented in Experiment 1; one of the two titles consisted of the name of
the protagonist and the central theme of the LB + C condition. The other title consisted of the name of the protagonist and the central theme of the LB + NC
condition. For each baseline passage, we created two
titles that could both fit. Titles in the Baseline condition
consisted of the name of the protagonist and a word
or phrase about something that is mentioned in the
passage, with the constraint that the content of the
title is not related to the critical sentence-initial and sentence-final nouns.
After participants chose the title that they thought fits
best, feedback was provided by a screen that reported
the title choices of other people, expressed as percentages. See Figure 4 for an example. To provide participants with authentic feedback percentages, i.e. based
on real title judgments, as well as to reinforce the
cover story that the experiment was about choosing
titles, we provided percentages from a norming study
carried out through a Qualtrics survey on Amazon's
Mechanical Turk. Participants in the norming study (N
= 71) were given 90 passages with two titles, 30 in
each condition, and were asked to choose the title that
better fits each passage. For passages with a central
theme (LB + C and LB + NC conditions), 86.82% (SD =
8.03%) of the participant responses chose the title that
we defined as reflecting the central theme. As expected,
for passages in the baseline condition, participants
responses were more variable; 59.61% (SD = 13.30%) of
the responses chose title option 1 and the remaining
40.39% chose title option 2.

Results
Behavioural data. There was no right or wrong answer
to the title judgment question. However, by comparing
their own judgment with the majority judgment displayed on the screen participants remain engaged with
the task of title selection. In their selection of the
better title, participants in the ERP experiment showed
high agreement (M = 88.07%, SD = 3.87%) with the title
that was chosen as better by the majority of the participants in the online norming study, which was always the
central theme title. Choosing a title for the Baseline
passage was more variable, consistent with the variability
in the norming responses, with ERP participants showing
an average agreement of 59.06% (SD = 7.78%) with title
option 1.

ERP data. Data preprocessing and analyses were the
same as in Experiment 1. For sentence-initial nouns,
automated artefact detection lead to the exclusion of
7.44% (SD = 7.51%) of trials in the LB + C condition,
7.56% (SD = 9.05%) of trials in the LB + NC condition,
and 8.11% (SD = 8.96%) of trials in the Baseline condition.
For sentence-final nouns, 7.33% (SD = 8.64%) of trials in
the LB + C condition were excluded, 7.33% (SD = 8.18%)
in the LB + NC condition, and 8.78% (SD = 8.05%) of
trials in the Baseline condition. Grand average waveforms for representative electrode clusters are displayed
in Figure 5 for sentence-initial nouns and in Figure 6 for
sentence-final nouns. The full ANOVA table with results
for sentence-initial and sentence-final nouns can be
found in the online supplementary materials.

Sentence-initial nouns
N400 analyses. The local binding opportunity did not
produce an N400 reduction: LB + NC and Baseline did
not differ reliably. In contrast to Experiment 1, thematic
centrality had a reliable effect on the N400: Sentenceinitial nouns that were related to the central theme (LB
+ C) elicited reduced negativity relative to the same
nouns that were not related to the central theme (LB +
NC) in midline clusters. These conclusions are based on
the following analyses.
Midline analyses (Fz, Cz, Pz). A main effect of condition,
F(2, 58) = 6.09, p = .004, p = .17 indicated that there was
no local binding effect: there were no significant N400
differences between LB + NC [M = -.67V; 95% CI (-1.02,
-.32)] and Baseline [M = -.68V; 95% CI (-1.05, -.31)], p
= .956. There was an effect of the central theme: The
N400 for LB + C [M = -.25V; 95% CI (-.59, .10)] was
reduced relative to LB + NC, p = .001, most visible at Cz
and Pz.
Laterality analyses (F3, C3, P3, F4, C4, P4). The main effect
of condition was only marginally significant, F(2, 58) = 3.25,
p = .062, p = .08. Additional tests found no significant
N400 differences between LB + NC [M = -.32V; 95% CI
(-.56, -.07)] and Baseline [M = -.24V; 95% CI (-.45, -.03)],
p = .554. However, the N400 was reduced for the central
theme (LB + C [M = -.07V; 95% CI (-.26, .13)]) relative to
local binding only (LB + NC), p = .007.

1249

P600 analyses. The main effect of condition was only marginally significant in the midline analyses, F(2, 58) = 3.30, p
= .053, p = .10. Additional tests found no significant P600
differences between Baseline [M = .37V; 95% CI (.07, .67)]
and LB + NC [M = .48V; 95% CI (.15, .81)], p = .561. Although
the effect of the central theme showed reliable P600 differences between LB + C [M = .78V; 95% CI (.53, 1.04)] and LB
+ NC, p = .022, this difference appears to sustain the voltage
shift initiated in the N400 time window, rather than reflect
an independent ERP component.

Sentence-final nouns
N400 analyses. Neither the local binding opportunity
nor the central theme produced a reliable N400 effect:
LB + NC elicited a reduced N400 relative to Baseline but
this difference did not reach significance, nor did the
difference between LB + C and LB + NC. These conclusions are based on the following analyses.
Midline analyses (Fz, Cz, Pz). A significant interaction of
condition with cluster, F(4, 116) = 3.39, p = .048, p = .11
indicated condition differences at parietal electrodes, Pz,
F(2, 58) = 3.15, p = .036, p = .11, but not at central electrodes, Cz, F(2, 58) = 1.68, p = .195 and frontal electrodes,
Fz, F(2, 58) = 3.08, p = .067. At Pz there was no local
binding effect; the N400 was reduced for LB + NC [M =
1.43V; 95% CI (.80, 2.06)] relative to Baseline [M
= .78V; 95% CI (.23, 1.33)], but not reliably (p = .087).
There was also no effect of the central theme: LB + C
[M = 1.61V; 95% CI (1.06, 2.16)] and LB + NC showed
no significant differences (p = .564).
A post-hoc comparison of LB + C vs Baseline at Pz indicated N400 reductions for nouns that had a local binding
opportunity and were related to the central theme (LB +
C), relative to Baseline, p = .012.
Laterality analyses (F3, C3, P3, F4, C4, P4). There were
no significant main effects of condition or interactions

Discussion
As in Experiment 1, evidence for local integration was
weak when the local antecedent did not refer to the
central theme. The differences between LB + NC and
Baseline were in the expected direction, but did not
reach standard significance. In contrast to Experiment
1, antecedent nouns that were related to the central
theme (LB + C) produced a reduced N400 relative to
antecedents that were not (LB + NC). This centrality
effect suggests that the instruction to choose which of
two titles fits better with each passage encouraged participants to attend to thematic elements.
The pattern of results for sentence-final nouns was
similar to that of Experiment 1. However, the local
binding effect at the N400, although in the same direction as Experiment 1, was not statistically reliable (p
= .087). Similar to Experiment 1, we found a more positive P600 for sentence-final nouns in the baseline condition than the local binding condition. Finally,
sentence-final nouns with a local binding opportunity
and thematic centrality (LB + C) showed the same N400
and P600 patterns as in Experiment 1: not significantly
different from the local-binding-only condition (LB +
NC), but significantly different from baseline.

General discussion
Helder et al. (2019) found that, at the beginning of a sentence, word-to-text integration effects reflected in the
N400 were restricted to the local sentence context (the
preceding sentence) with no further influence of global
context as instantiated by thematic centrality. Although
the conclusion that local context dominates integrative
processes is consistent with theories of text processing
that emphasise word-initiated bottom-up processes
(e.g. Kintsch & Van Dijk, 1978), we reasoned that
specific text and reader factors may influence the relative
contributions of local and global influences on the processing of a single word. The two experiments reported
here created conditions designed to enable the

1251

emergence of global context effects (thematic centrality)
in word-to-text integration. First, we positioned the text
segment that provides a local binding opportunity
across a sentence boundary farther from the critical
word on which ERPs were measured. Thus, the antecedent for the sentence-initial noun was near the beginning of the preceding sentence, rather than at the end,
in contrast with Helder et al. (2019). We reasoned that
this should make the text segment less accessible in
memory, thus allowing its reduced accessibility to be
boosted by thematic centrality. The results of Experiment
1 were somewhat mixed concerning this possibility.
When an antecedent text referred to the central theme
and was remotely positioned near the beginning of the
preceding sentence (still defined as "local"), the sentence-initial noun showed a reduced N400 relative to a
baseline. However, a direct comparison of the two conditions that provided local binding - one with centrality
(C) and one without (NC) - showed only a nonsignificant
advantage of centrality. Thus, in Experiment 1, the thematic centrality effect is weak, observable compared to
a baseline condition that had no local binding opportunity and no central theme, but not compared to a condition that had only a local binding opportunity.
In Experiment 2, reasoning that thematic centrality
effects would be encouraged by a task that required
more global integration, we asked readers to judge the
suitability of titles for the passages, rather than make
true-false judgments. Indeed, the central theme now
had a clear effect on ERP measures, showing a significantly
reduced N400 for the central condition relative to the noncentral condition, as well as relative to the baseline. The
noncentral condition, local binding without centrality,
did not differ significantly from baseline, although, as in
Experiment 1, it was in the predicted direction.
Thus, across the two experiments, integrative processes were in evidence at the first noun across a sentence
boundary: The N400 was reduced when the local binding
opportunity was remotely positioned in the preceding
sentence and was related to the central theme. The centrality effect occurred weakly (relative to noncentral) in
Experiment 1 and more robustly in Experiment 2, where
instructions encouraged global processing. The occurrence of a reduced N400 when the antecedent information was relatively remote further supports the
interpretation that the N400 across a sentence boundary
can reflect integration of the word with a text memory
rather than local word-to-word associations, consistent
with conclusions from previous studies of effects across
a sentence boundary (Calloway & Perfetti, 2017; Stafura
et al., 2015; Stafura & Perfetti, 2014). The results also
provide some support for each of the possibilities hypothesised for the conditions for a global effect to emerge: (1)

1252

a more remote binding site that reduced the recency of
the antecedent text, allowing its accessibility to be
boosted by centrality and (2) instructions that encouraged
more global processing. The experiments cannot inform
us whether both conditions are necessary for the effect.
These key conclusions are intertwined with related
results that we discuss below before returning to the
implications of the results for integrative text processes.

Word-to-text integration at sentence beginnings
and sentence endings
Sentence beginnings. The mechanisms that underlie the
integration of words into text memory depend on a
word's position in the sentence. Ends of sentences
require the closing of structures that produces integration
at multiple levels. Beginnings of sentences allow (rather
than require) integration only when the word being
read serves as a retrieval trigger for text memory. The
first words of a new sentence prompt the building of
new structures, a default obligatory operation that
excludes the routine integrative processes that occur subsequently in a sentence. In Experiment 1, the presence of
a binding site in the preceding sentence that was related
to the central theme produced a reduction in the N400 on
the critical word, the first noun across the sentence
boundary, compared with a baseline condition that
lacked a binding site and a central theme. In Experiment
2, when the task encouraged readers to build a representation based on the text as a whole, thematic centrality
produced a reduction of the N400. Thus, sentence-initial
effects of thematic centrality were observable in short
texts when conditions encourage global processing.
Sentence endings. At the final word of a sentence, the
reader has multiple open structures to close - the
current sentence, the current clause, one or more constituent phrases, and, in the current experiments, the
end of a passage. A word that meaningfully and grammatically closes these structures, as in our baseline condition, provides an integrative fit with the passage as a
whole. A local binding site at the end of the preceding
sentence produced an N400 reduction on the final
word of the passage-ending sentence in Experiment
1. In Experiment 2, however, where participants were
encouraged to attend to the central theme of the
passage, the N400 was reduced only for nouns that
had a local binding opportunity and were related to
the central theme, relative to Baseline. These results are
slightly different from those of Helder et al. (2019, Experiment 2), which showed a trend toward an N400 centrality effect at the end of sentences when centrality was
reinforced by a title. However, the texts of those experiments differed from the texts of the current experiments

in not having a local binding site for the final word and
also in not having a baseline reference point. If a local
binding site is the dominant locus of integration, the
absence of a local binding site in Helder et al. (2019)
may have allowed emergence of a global influence.
Thus, we suggest that, in general, end-of-sentence
effects indicated in the N400 are especially sensitive to
local sentence operations that include closing open
structures and integrating the meaning of the final
word with local text meaning, rather than global effects.
ERP studies of text processing sometimes report a late
positivity or P600 component associated with the fit of a
word with its contexts. This parietal P600 has been interpreted specifically as an indicator of discourse memory
updating, with the N400 effect relegated to a more
local, early phase of semantic associative integration
(Brouwer et al., 2012; Burkhardt, 2007). In Helder et al.
(2019) we found a P600 centrality effect in both experiments: Sentence-final nouns in the noncentral condition
produced a larger positivity than the same words in the
central condition in parietal clusters, consistent with the
interpretation that greater cost to updating occurs when
the word is unrelated to the central theme. However, in
the present experiments, we found no such effect of centrality on the P600. This difference in results, as in the
N400, may have resulted from the presence (present
experiments) or absence (Helder et al., 2019) of more
accessible local binding sites.
In Experiment 1, we did find a late positivity around
600ms that distinguished the local binding condition
(less positive) from the baseline condition (more positive), an effect most visible in frontal and left central clusters. Because the frontal location does not correspond to
the meaning congruence P600, this late positivity might
reflect the frontal post-N400 positivity (fPNP) identified
by Van Petten and Luka (2012). Their fPNP was observed
for critical words that were congruent with preceding
context but low in predictability (and that produce an
N400 relative to a high-predictable word). Van Petten
and Luka (2012) interpreted the effect as reflecting a
cost to failed prediction at the specific word level, an
interpretation supported by recent behavioural (Ness &
Meltzer-Asscher, 2018) and ERP (Kuperberg et al., 2020;
Ness & Meltzer-Asscher, 2018) evidence. This interpretation also might apply to our sentence-final results in
the baseline condition, where the baseline sentencefinal word produced a central-parietal N400 effect relative to local binding and was congruent with the
context, two features of the fPNP. However, unlike the
experiments cited above, in the present experiments
both the sentence for the final-word comparison and
the critical word itself were identical across baseline
and local binding conditions; thus, in the present

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

studies, the effects on the sentence-final word can be
localised in the preceding sentence. This would seem a
challenge to an exclusively prediction-based account
that targets a specific word at the end of the following
sentence, and may be more consistent with memorybased integrability. We note the fact that we observe
this frontal positivity also in the LH (left central electrodes) and this may distinguish it from the frontal PNP.
In Experiment 2, the sentence-final noun also produced more positivity in the P600 time window for the
baseline than for local binding conditions, in left
central and parietal electrode clusters but not frontal
clusters. This result is consistent with the interpretation
that a binding site in the preceding sentence provides
updating with less cost than a sentence with no
binding site. This end-of-sentence P600 effect is consistent with the results of Helder et al. (2019), who also using
high-density recordings with average referencing;
however, it is difficult to make comparisons of ERP components (including the N400, the P600, and the fPNP)
with the many studies (e.g. most of those cited in Van
Petten & Luka, 2012) that used the average of the left
and right mastoid electrodes to re-reference the data.

Influence of readers' goals on processing of texts
The results of Experiment 2 suggest that a reader's goal
can influence the integrative processes that link a single
word to the meaning of the text. This interpretation does
not derive from a single experimental design that tests
the effects of the instructions readers receive. Rather, it
rests on comparisons with the weak effects of centrality
in Experiment 1 and in two experiments reported in
Helder et al., 2019. In contrast to these weak or null
effects, a centrality effect emerged clearly in the
present Experiment 2, in which readers made judgments
on the appropriateness of titles.
How the integration process could be affected by
selecting titles is not entirely clear; however, at a coarse
level of description, the effect may reflect the gradual
emergence of a higher-level text structure from the successive processing of meaning-related text segments
(e.g. Van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). In these processes, implicit
or explicit reading goals determine the allocation of attentional and memory resources and, hence, the eventual
mental representation of the text as a whole (van den
Broek & Helder, 2017; van den Broek et al., 1999). Underlying this general description is the assumption that the
reader builds a foundation for understanding in the first
sentence (Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997). Because, in our
experiments, the central theme is introduced in the first
sentence, the theme begins and remains central to the
mental model that the reader builds over the short

1253

passage. Further, a protagonist - one of the organising
dimensions of situation models (Zwaan et al., 1995) - is
introduced in the first sentence, providing a narrative
anchor for the events described by the text. The critical
word and its antecedents are associated with the protagonist, together constituting the central theme. Because
each of the two title choices always involves the name
of the protagonist (e.g. Vivian the Photographer vs. Vivian
the Food Critic), this could allocate attention to the protagonist and lead to the enhancement of the central theme.

Integration or meaning retrieval?
We have interpreted our N400 results as reflecting an
initial phase of an integrative process that links the
meaning of a word to the contents of recent text
memory. The difference between our integration
account and a meaning retrieval account (Brouwer
et al., 2012; Delogu et al., 2019) lies in the nature of the
relevant memory content. Our assumption is that the
linkage occurs between a word meaning and a text
meaning that includes words and elementary meaning
propositions. On the word-meaning retrieval account,
the relevant memory content is a set of recently activated unstructured meaning features that serve as
primes to facilitate the retrieval of word meaning.
Delogu et al. (2019) provide a demonstration of this
idea: The N400 on a critical word was unaffected when
the sentence in which it occurred was inconsistent
with the previous sentence, thus making integration in
the usual sense impossible. For example, the N400 on
"menu" in the sentence "Before long he opened the
menu" was the same whether the preceding sentence
conveyed someone entering a restaurant or leaving it;
and the N400 was more positive than when the word
"restaurant" was absent in the preceding sentence. The
implication is that word meaning priming (restaurantmenu), not sentence meaning, produces N400 effects.
We cannot entirely rule out a word-meaning retrieval
account for our results, but there is no reason to prefer
such an account here. First, unlike in Delogu et al.
(2019), where the associated word was at the end of
the preceding sentence, the experiments reported here
had an average of 9 words and a sentence boundary
between an antecedent binding site and the critical
word. Further, our previous results have demonstrated
that the association strength between a word in the preceding sentence and the key word across a sentence
boundary did not affect the magnitude of the N400
(Stafura & Perfetti, 2014) and that when the backward
association (from critical word back to preceding sentence word) was stronger than the forward association,
N400s were also observed (with a different time course

1254

A. HELDER ET AL.

and topography), implicating a memory process. We also
note that the present experiments do not exploit violations, but present consistently meaningful texts. Thus,
they allow an incremental perspective that attributes
effects to manipulated features within the range of
coherent texts, avoiding the risk of overlapping
meaning-enhancing and meaning-contradicting influences on ERP data. Finally, our experiments have an atypical focus on the first content word across a sentence
boundary, in contrast to the more typical within-sentence and end of sentence locations. As we have
argued, sentence beginnings present low word predictability and obligations for structure building. Brouwer
et al. (2012) showed that the word-meaning retrieval
account provides a parsimonious account of a large
number of N400 results. Whether it can account for
results in the paradigms used here can be addressed in
research specifically designed to do so.

Conclusion: global effects on the processing of a
single word
Every word, as it is read, provides an opportunity for
structure building and integration. Although structure
building is obligatory at the beginning of a sentence,
integration can also occur when reading the word
prompts retrieval of an associated text meaning. This
integration is dependent on the accessibility of sources
(binding sites) in text memory. Within-sentence sites
are highly accessible through the syntactic and corresponding semantic structures that are being built.
Thus, integration is routine across multiple levels of
text representation. For words at the beginning of a sentence, the absence of already-opened syntactic structures means that accessibility to binding sites is
restricted to memory retrieval cues provided by the
word itself. The present experiments suggest that these
retrieval cues are strengthened when the word being
read is related to an antecedent in the preceding sentences that is also related to the central theme. Thematic
contributions to integration may be strengthened when
instructions encourage the reader's goal to be directed
to the global structure of the text.
To place these observations in the context of research
not focused on sentence beginnings, considerable evidence demonstrates global text level effects during
reading of a single word. One way to produce global
text level effects is to create a fictitious scenario for the
reader. For example, when Nieuwland and Van Berkum
(2006) presented readers with texts that gave human
qualities to inanimate objects (peanuts falling in love),
readers showed an N400, indicative of meaning incongruence, upon reading a sentence that conveyed

meaningful real-world attributes (e.g. peanuts are
salted). Another way to expose the use of global
context is to bias readers away from the dominant
meaning of an ambiguous word. An eye-tracking study
by Kambe et al. (2001) provides some parallels to the
present experiments. Their study presented readers
with short paragraphs and manipulated the availability
of global and local context to establish a bias toward
the meaning of an ambiguous word. Kambe et al.
(2001) observed that both local and global context
(alone or in combination) were effective in biasing
readers towards the subordinate meaning of the ambiguous target word (e.g. "band" presented in the subordinate meaning context of an engraved wedding ring
and in the dominant meaning context of a rock
concert). Moreover, Kambe et al. (2001) found no
additional effect of global context when local context
was available and consistent with the global context.
Thus, despite the differences between methods (eyetracking vs. ERP) and critical word properties (ambiguous
words vs unambiguous words), we see converging conclusions on the dominant role of local context, when it
is available, on processing the meaning of a single
word. Our experiments add to the conclusion that
there are conditions, including explicit influence on
reading goals, that can cause the emergence of global
effects beyond those attributable to local context.

Notes
1. The text segment that provided the binding opportunity
for critical nouns was more variable than in Helder et al.
(2019): for about half of the passages, the binding opportunity was word-specific co-reference, as in Example 1 of
Table 2; for the other passages, the binding opportunity
was a semantically related word or phrase, as in Example
2 of Table 2.
2. Average channel re-reference method allows comparisons of the present results to previous studies using
the cross-boundary word-to-text integration paradigm,
including the study of centrality effects (Helder et al.,
2019). This average re-referencing procedure is
common with the high density arrays used in the
present study, but less common overall than using the
mastoid electrodes.
