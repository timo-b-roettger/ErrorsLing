This study investigated the syntactic bootstrapping abilities of children who
differed by language abilities and age. In the first study, the performance of 5year-old children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) was compared to that
of two groups of typically developing children--one of equivalent language
levels, as indexed by mean length of utterance (MLU), and the other of equivalent
chronological age. In the second study, two groups of 7-year-old children, one
whose language was developing typically and one with SLI, were involved. The
count/mass distinction was used as the basis for the experimental tasks. A
videotaped story was used to present the novel count and mass words, with
syntactic cues in one condition and with neutral syntax in another. Results from the
first study revealed that only the 5-year-old nonaffected control children showed
evidence of using the syntactic cues. The 5-year-old SLI group and 3-year-old
control group achieved comparable scores. However, error analyses suggested
that different factors were operative in the two groups. The second study revealed
that there was continued growth into the early school years for children with SLI
and children whose language was developing typically.

t has been well documented that, in general, preschool children acquire new words at a surprisingly rapid rate (Carey, 1978). One aspect of word learning that has been studied is initial word-referent
mapping based on limited exposure. This process is often referred to as
fast mapping. Fast mapping studies with normal language learners have
shown that preschool children can form initial, partial representations
for novel words in didactic teaching situations (Apel, Kamhi, &
Dollaghan, 1985; Dickinson, 1984; Dollaghan, 1985, 1987; Heibeck &
Markman, 1987). Furthermore, work by Rice and her colleagues (Oetting,
Rice, & Swank, 1995; Rice, 1990a; Rice, Buhr, & Nemeth, 1990; Rice,
Buhr, & Oetting, 1992; Rice & Woodsmall, 1988) has demonstrated that
children are able to form initial word-referent mappings when the new
words are embedded in videotaped stories, a more natural learning situation. Quick incidental learning (QUIL) is the term that has been applied to this form of word learning.
For some time it has been recognized that limited lexical development is one of the hallmarks of specific language impairment (Leonard,
1988, 1998; Rice, 1990b). In a fast mapping study, Dollaghan (1987)
found that 4- to 5-year-old children with language impairments were
able to comprehend the novel name of an unfamiliar object as readily

as age-matched typically developing children. However,
the ability of the children with language impairments
to produce the novel words was less than that of their
peers. Rice and her colleagues have examined the QUIL
abilities of children with SLI and determined that this
is an area of vulnerability (Oetting et al., 1995; Rice,
1990b; Rice et al., 1990; Rice et al., 1992). In their studies, 5-year-old children with SLI were able to learn novel
words that were presented as part of videotaped stories. However, they mapped fewer words to their referents than normal language learners matched for age and
language level as indexed by MLU.
Although it has been shown that children can fast
map words, the details of how children do this are unknown. The way in which children align their knowledge of the world, their lexical representation of that
knowledge, and the formal grammatical devices associated with lexical representations is a matter of unresolved controversy. There have been a number of studies that suggest that preschoolers learning language
normally can use syntactic cues to aid in lexical mapping in structured situations. This has been referred to
as syntactic bootstrapping (Bedore & Leonard, 1995;
Gleitman, 1990; Gleitman & Gleitman, 1992). With syntactic bootstrapping, the listener uses the syntactic
frame and morphological markers associated with a
novel word to aid in the determination of its referent.
Morphological markers include prenominal forms such
as determiners (e.g., articles, any, some) and classifiers
(e.g., adjectives; cf. Chierchia, 1994; Klibanoff &
Waxman, 1999). Brown (1957) reported that children
between the ages of 3 and 5 years of age were able to
use the cues a/another, any/some, and -ing to assign
novel names to count items, mass items, and actions
respectively. Katz, Baker, and Macnamara (1974) reported that 2-year-old girls could differentiate between
novel proper and common nouns based on the presence
of the article a if the word referred to a semantically
appropriate item (i.e., a doll). This effect was not seen
in the boys in this study. In a later study, Gelman and
Taylor (1984) reported that both 2-year-old boys and girls
were able to use the syntactic cue to differentiate novel
common and proper nouns. The effect of syntactic cues
on class assignment for novel words has also been demonstrated for nouns versus prepositions (Landau &
Stecker, 1990), nouns versus verbs (Dockrell & McShane,
1990), and various classes of verbs (Behrend, Harris, &
Cartwright, 1995).
It has been reported by a number of researchers that
morphosyntax is particularly difficult for children with
SLI (e.g., Cleave & Rice, 1997; Leonard, 1989, 1998;
Oetting & Horohov, 1997; Rice & Wexler, 1996; Rice,
Wexler, & Cleave, 1995; Rice, Wexler, & Hershberger, 1998;
Rice, Wexler, & Redmond, 1999; Watkins & Rice, 1994).
Given that children with SLI demonstrate difficulties

with both lexical acquisition and morphology, it is reasonable to ask if the lexical limitations of children with
SLI are related to their difficulties with morphology.
With regard to verb acquisition, Oetting (1999) found
that 6-year-old children with SLI could use argument
structure cues to interpret novel verbs as readily as their
age controls but they did not retain the new verbs as
well. This suggests that nonmorphological cues such as
argument structure can be useful for children with SLI
for their initial interpretation of novel verbs. Eyer,
Leonard, Bedore, Anderson, and Viescas (1998) reported
that young children with SLI benefitted from morphosyntactic cues such as articles and word order (e.g., I
found a shong) to deduce that a novel word was a noun
and not a verb.
This study focused on noun learning and the possible role of determiners within the noun phrase to guide
children's initial understanding of the meanings of novel
nouns. Of particular relevance here is the finding that
5-year-old children with SLI are more likely to omit
the articles a/the than are age-matched or 3-year-old
language-matched control children (Rice & Wexler,
1996). This suggests that if SLI children do not have a
robust representation of articles, they would have fewer
grammatical cues to use for learning the meanings of
novel nouns.
Preschool children without language impairments
are known to draw upon the grammatical context provided by determiners to learn novel words for things
that can be counted as individual items (count nouns,
such as car) versus things that are treated lexically as
nonindividuated substances (mass nouns, such as water [Bloom, 1994; Chierchia, 1994; Dickinson, 1988;
Gathercole, 1986; Gordon, 1985, 1988; Soja, 1992; Soja,
Carey, & Spelke, 1991]). In this study, we used the count/
mass distinction to explore children's use of grammatical cues in the assignment of novel names to novel objects and to determine if children with SLI have a selective disadvantage for lexical learning that is associated
with fewer grammatical cues.

Design
The study involved groups of children who were randomly assigned to one of two viewing conditions. The
children viewed a videotaped story in which novel count
and mass items were presented. For the children in the
Cued Syntax condition, the narration provided syntactic cues as to the assignment of novel word to novel object. For the children in the Neutral Syntax condition,
there were no syntactic cues provided.
This study was designed to investigate factors that
can affect the use of grammatical cues in the assignment of names to things. One such factor is whether or

not children control the grammatical contrast that serves
as a cue. Children in the process of learning a language
structure, such as the determiner system, may have only
partial knowledge of its features, and, thus, they may
not be able to benefit from the cues provided by the structure as an adult would. In the first study, the performance of a group of 5-year-old children with SLI was
compared to that of two groups of typically developing
children--one matched for age and the other for language level as indexed by MLU. The second study extended the findings by including two groups of 7-yearold children--one consisting of children with SLI, the
other of typically developing children. This design allowed for an examination of the effect of both language
learning abilities and age variables. The influence of
language abilities was examined by comparing the performance of the SLI groups with that of the typically
developing groups. The influence of age was examined
by comparing within the three typically developing
groups and then between the two SLI groups.
A second factor involves performance demands, such
as the recall of novel things and novel names. In this study,
error responses were analyzed for evidence of limited recall of words and things in the introducing condition.
A third factor involves the conditions under which
the novel names are introduced. If young children are
to receive maximal benefit from the use of grammatical
cues to guide word learning, they must be able to do so
in the press of naturalistic on-line processing. For this
study, the new words were introduced in simple story
scenes presented on videotape, which had the further
advantages of standardizing the introducing conditions
across subjects, eliminating inadvertent examiner bias,
and generating carefully matched experimental and control conditions.
The specific questions under evaluation were as
follows:
1. Do young children in syntax-informative input
conditions use grammatical information in the assignment of novel words to novel things?
2. Are there differences attributable to the completeness of the child's representation of the linguistic structures such that children with limited grammatical competencies (e.g., SLI children) are less likely to benefit
from informative syntax than are children with greater
grammatical competencies?
3. Are there developmental differences, both within
typically developing groups and SLI groups, such that
older children have higher levels of syntax-consistent
lexical assignment than younger children?
4. Are there differences in the types of errors made
by the three groups which suggest different sources of
difficulty?

Study One
Methods
Participants
Sixty-two children participated in this study. Twenty
of the participants were identified as SLI, 20 were typically developing children of equivalent language levels,
and 22 were typically developing children of equivalent
chronological age. All of the participants were drawn
from monolingual English-speaking homes and were
enrolled in one of several area preschool or day care programs in eastern and central Kansas. Because we did
not contact parents for ethnicity or SES data, we did
not record it for these participants (cf. Entwhistle &
Astone, 1994, who strongly recommend that parents be
the source of ethnicity and SES data). In other studies
whose samples were drawn from the same attendance
centers, we recruit approximately 10% minority participants, distributed evenly across the three groups (e.g.,
Rice, Wexler, & Hershberger, 1998).
The children with SLI were approximately 5 years
of age (5-SLI group). Their ages ranged from 54 to 68
months (M = 59.85, SD = 4.40). There were 10 girls and
10 boys in the group. They had been diagnosed as having a language impairment by a certified speech-language
pathologist and were enrolled in a preschool program for
children with language impairment. Their intellectual
functioning was within normal limits, as evidenced by
an age deviation score of 85 or above on the Columbia
Mental Maturity Scale (CMMS; Burgemeister, Blum, &
Lorge, 1972). They displayed normal hearing, according to a hearing screening or audiological examination
conducted within 6 months of the study. Their receptive
and expressive language performance was below age
expectations. Each subject scored one or more standard
deviations below the mean on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R; Dunn & Dunn, 1981)
and produced an MLU one or more standard deviations
below the mean. The MLU measure was based on analysis of a language sample of at least 100 utterances and
the normative information provided by Leadholm and
Miller (1992). The children in the 5-SLI group were randomly assigned to one of the two viewing conditions:
Cued Syntax (N = 11) and Neutral Syntax (N = 9).
Two groups of typically developing nonaffected children also participated in the study: one at equivalent
levels of language development as indexed by MLU, who
were approximately 3 years old (3N group), and the other
at equivalent chronological age (5N group). The ages of
the 20 children in the 3N group ranged from 30 to 40
months (M = 35.50, SD = 3.24). Eleven were girls and 9
were boys. These children displayed normal intelligence,

hearing, and social development, according to teacher report, and their performance on the PPVT-R was within or
above one standard deviation above the mean. MLU was
used as the grouping variable because of its conventional
status as a general index of language development for
preschool children. The 3N group demonstrated an MLU
within or above one standard deviation of the mean expected for age (Leadholm & Miller, 1992). In addition, the
MLU of each child in this group was within .10 morphemes
of the MLU of one of the children in the 5-SLI group. Assignment to the viewing conditions was carried out such
that for each child in the 5-SLI group there was a child in
the 3N group whose MLU was within .10 morphemes
assigned to the same viewing condition. Eleven children
were assigned to the Cued Syntax condition, and 9 were
assigned to the Neutral Syntax condition.

expert with the transcription/coding system. Transcription and coding followed the conventions for the SALT
software (Miller & Chapman, 1991), which were described in detail in an internal lab manual. All were
trained to a standard of 95% agreement with three practice child samples of more than 500 child utterances
before the experimental data collection. Two graduate
assistants collected the samples and transcribed and
coded the child utterances. Each examiner completed
the samples for the children whose data she collected.
Two other graduate assistants made a second pass
through the audio recordings to insert the adult utterances, and while they were listening to the tapes they
also checked on the transcription and coding. Any disagreements with transcription or coding were noted and
resolved via consultation with the initial coder. Finally,
10% of the data were checked by a lab staff member
expert with the coding system; it was found to be 95-
99% consistent with the expert coding.

There were 22 children in the 5N group. They ranged
in age from 55 to 67 months (M = 60.91, SD = 3.83).
There were 14 girls and 8 boys. These children displayed
normal intellectual functioning as evidenced by an age
deviation score of 85 or above on the CMMS. Their performance on the PPVT-R was within or above one standard deviation above the mean. Their hearing and social development was also normal according to teacher
report. As with the 5-SLI group, children in the 5N group
were randomly assigned to one of the two viewing conditions, with 11 children being assigned to each condition. In addition to the tests listed above, the GoldmanFristoe Test of Articulation (GFTA; Goldman & Fristoe,
1986) was administered to all children to assess their
sound production. Table 1 summarizes the results of the
identification testing for the three groups.

Materials
Naming Task
A naming task was administered as a way of evaluating the children's ability to differentiate the two classes
of objects (count vs. mass things) for the purpose of semantic classification. Specifically, the task tested
whether the children, when asked to label an unfamiliar object, were able to use a familiar count name to
refer to a novel count thing and a familiar mass name to
refer to a novel substance. Four novel count items (i.e., a
white plastic drawer glide, one half of a gold window lock,
a gray plastic light socket, and a beige plastic loop) and
four novel masses (i.e., loose tea, purple decorator sand,
instant potato flakes, and sawdust) were presented to
the child one at a time. The children were encouraged
to look at and explore each item. Then they were asked
to provide a name for the item. The label the children

gave and any use of a determiner was recorded.
A secondary purpose of the naming task was to familiarize the children with the properties of the objects
that they would be viewing in the experimental task.
The novel substances were clearly poured out of a container, to demonstrate that they were nonsolids.

Video Stimuli
The experimental task involved viewing a videotaped story in which novel count and mass items were
introduced. Sixteen nonce forms were presented in pairs,
one count and one mass, within eight videotaped segments. Each nonce form corresponded to 1 of 16 unfamiliar referents; half of these referents were count items
and the other half mass items. Unfamiliar objects from
a hardware or craft store (e.g., plumber's T) were used
for the count referents. The mass referents included a
variety of granulated or small individualized substances
that varied in color and texture (e.g., crushed seaweed).
Pilot testing confirmed that children under 5 years of
age could not name any of the count or mass items. The
nonce forms followed English orthographic rules and
involved early emerging phonemes. Half of the count
terms were monosyllabic and half were bisyllabic. The
same was true of the mass terms. A description of the
experimental items and the nonce forms assigned to each
item is provided in Table 2.
The video consisted of eight segments involving an
Oscar the Grouch puppet and two female actors. In each
segment, one novel mass item and one novel count item
were introduced. A narrated story about how Oscar's
can became filled with trash tied the video segments
Table 2. Stimuli: label and description.
Nonce label

Description of item

Two versions of the narrated story were used for
the creation of two viewing conditions--one in which
the syntax provided cues for the assignment of novel
word to novel object (Cued Syntax) and the other in
which neutral syntax was used (Neutral Syntax). In the
Cued Syntax condition, the novel count terms were preceded by the determiner a; the novel mass terms were
preceded by the determiner some (e.g., Look, I found a
keelwug and some blick). In the Neutral Syntax condition, both count and mass terms were preceded by the
determiners the or my (e.g., "Look I found the keelwug
and the blick"). The order in which the count and mass
terms were mentioned in each pair was counterbalanced.
Pilot testing of the video stimuli using adults confirmed
that the two forms of the narration provided the expected
cues. A total of 10 adults viewed the videotapes. The 5
adults who viewed the Cued Syntax condition were almost perfect in their mapping of novel word to novel
object (M = 15.6 out of a possible 16). The 5 adults who
viewed the Neutral Syntax condition performed essentially at chance, as was predicted (M = 7.6). The script
of the videotape appears in the Appendix.

together. The first four segments involved Oscar and a
woman who cleans out her purse by throwing items into
Oscar's trash can. The final four segments involved a second woman on the way to the dump whom Oscar stops
and convinces to put items in his trash can. In each scene,
the woman presented the novel count and mass items simultaneously and labeled them five times, always in the
same sentence (e.g., "I found a keelwug and some blick").
The final shot of each scene was a "tombstone shot" in
which the camera zoomed in on the two items in the trash
can, providing a clear focus on the novel pair. Throughout
each scene, the two novel items were always presented
and labeled together. Each video segment was about 1
min; total viewing time was approximately 7 min.

Comprehension of the novel count and mass terms
was tested using a picture-pointing task that paralleled
the format of the PPVT-R. There were 16 four-picture
arrays, one for each target item. Each four-picture array consisted of the target item, the other item in the
pair, a second count item, and a second mass item. The
nontarget mass and count items were present in the
video segments as background objects when the experimental items were introduced. Following the PPVT-R
format, the children were asked to point to the target
items (e.g., Show me blick). No determiner was used in
the comprehension testing.

Procedures
The testing and experimental tasks were administered over a 3-day period to each participant in a quiet

room near the preschool or day care class. Each session
was 15 to 30 min in length. On the first two days standardized testing was completed, the mass/count probe
was administered, and the language sample was collected. Language samples were elicited via play with a
standard set of toys. Transcription and coding followed
the procedures outlined in a detailed lab manual. On
Day 3 the mass/count videotape was viewed. The procedures for Day 3 were as follows. The children were told
that they were going to watch a TV show about how
Oscar the Grouch got lots of trash in his trash can. They
were told to watch carefully because they would be asked
questions about the show. Then each child viewed the
first video segment. After viewing, the picture comprehension test was presented and the child was asked to
point to the pictures of the stimuli that were introduced
in the preceding scene. A different four-picture array
was used to test each count and mass item. Following
testing, the videotape was turned back on and the child
and examiner watched the second video segment. This
format of viewing and testing continued until all eight
video segments were completed.

Group comparisons were also conducted on the results from the GFTA. A one-way ANOVA on percentile
rank scores revealed significant group differences [F(2,
59) = 125.82, p < .000]. Follow-up t tests revealed that
the 5-SLI group differed from both the 3N [t(59) = 13.47,
p < .000] and the 5N group [t(59) = 14.09, p < .000].
There was no significant difference between the 3N and
5N groups [t(59) = .30, p > .77]. The difference in percentile rank for the children with SLI was largely attributable to their mispronunciation of /s/, /S/, /tS/, /r/, and
/l/. Although the 5-SLI group displayed difficulty with
phonology, the overall intelligibility of the children's
spontaneous samples was good. Furthermore, the overall intelligibility of the 5-SLI group was equivalent to
that of the 3N group in the spontaneous samples. The
percentage of intelligible utterances for the 5-SLI and
3N groups were 92% and 91% respectively.
For each of the three groups, t tests were completed
comparing initial testing results for the children in the
two experimental conditions. On each measure, there
was no significant difference.

Results
Preliminary Analyses
Identification Testing
Univariate one-way ANOVAs revealed the expected
group differences on the PPVT-R and MLU measures. For
the PPVT-R standard scores, the overall ANOVA indicated
significant group differences [F(2, 59) = 78.67, p < .000].
Follow-up t tests revealed that there were significant differences between the 5-SLI group and both the 3N group
[t(59) = 9.94, p < .000] and the 5N group [t(59) = 11.66, p <
.000]. There was no significant difference between the 3N
and 5N groups [t(59) = 1.48, p > .10]. For the MLU measures, the overall ANOVA again indicated significant group
differences [F(2, 59) = 32.70, p < .000]. Because the group
variances were significantly different, follow-up pairwise
comparisons used separate variance estimates. As expected, t tests revealed that there were significant differences between the 5N group and both the 5-SLI group
[t(30.7) = 6.27, p < .000] and the 3N group [t(36.4) = 6.39,
p < .000]. There was no significant difference between the
3N and 5-SLI groups [t(36.4) = .177, p > .860].
There was an unexpected group difference on CMMS
scores between the 5-SLI (M = 99.20) and 5N (M =
105.55) groups [t(40) = -2.42, p < .02]. However, all the
children in the 5-SLI group achieved scores within normal limits for their age. Therefore, cognitive levels of
the children in the 5-SLI group were sufficient to assume that they knew the difference between count things
and mass substances. This assumption was supported
by the 5-SLI group's performance on the naming task.

The performance of all the children on the Naming
Task indicated that they had the appropriate categorization for count and mass items to allow them to classify the novel objects. The children in all three groups
consistently differentiated count from mass things for
the purpose of labeling. In order to be regarded as "differentiated," the participants had to use count names
for count things and mass names for mass things. Labels such as plastic or red were regarded as ambiguous.
In the 5-SLI group, 16/20 children were classified as
differentiated namers; in the 3N group, 15/20; and in
the 5N group, 22/22 children. The unclassified children
relied heavily on ambiguous responses or no responses.

Spontaneous Speech Sample
The spontaneous speech samples were examined to
determine the children's use of the determiner a. The
three groups of children differed in their use of the determiner in spontaneous speech [F(2, 59) = 9.05, p <
.0004]. The sample means for percent use in obligatory
context were as follows: 5N, 87%; 3N, 76%; and 5-SLI,
58%. Pairwise comparisons yielded significant differences for all comparisons: ts > 2.02, ps < .05.

Experimental Task
The results from the experimental task are reported
in Table 3. The data were analyzed using a mixed model
of ANOVA (group by condition). There was a significant
main effect for group [F(2, 56) = 11.18, p < .000]. Followup pair-wise comparisons revealed significant differences

for all comparisons: ts > 2.3, ps < .02. The main effect
for condition was not significant [F(1, 56) = .669, p >

differences in conditions, t tests were carried out. Results revealed a significant difference between the Cued
Syntax and Neutral Syntax conditions for the 5N group
only [t(20) = 1.67, p = .05 (1-tail)]. The values for the 5SLI and 3N were t(18) = .16, p = .43 and t(20) = .66, p =
.25, respectively.

Error Analyses
Because it was possible for the children to err in
different ways, the errors of the groups were evaluated
and found to demonstrate different strategies. Recall
that on the comprehension test, the children were presented with a four-picture array and asked to point to
the correct picture. The test was designed to reveal the
children's error strategies as well as correct performance.
The four items consisted of (1) a picture of the target
item, (2) the other item in the pair, (3) a second count
item, and (4) a second mass item. The children's errors
were interpretable as one of the following: (a) An error
of pointing to option (2) was regarded as a Lexical Mapping strategy. In this case the child attached a novel
word to a novel object from the pair of objects presented,
but did so irrespective of the informative syntactic cues.
Another possibility (b) was an Object Kind strategy, in
which the error was the alternate object in the same
object class. A third possibility (c) was a Random strategy, in which selection of the (3) and (4) options fluctuated according to no discernible pattern.
The errors of the groups were examined to determine if the groups differed on the proportion of errors
that were lexical mapping errors. Because only the children in the Cued Syntax condition were provided with
the necessary information to make the "correct" choice,
only children in that condition were included in this error analysis. The mean proportions for the groups were
5-SLI: .60 (SD = .13, N = 11), 3N: .46 (SD = .21, N = 11),
5N: .69 (SD = .17, N = 11). A one-way ANOVA revealed
significant group differences [F(2, 29) = 5.05, p < .02].
588

Follow-up t tests revealed significant differences between
the 5-SLI and 3N groups [t(29) = -1.98, p < .05] and the
3N and 5N groups [t(29) < .004]. The difference between
the 5-SLI and 5N groups was not significant [t(29) =
1.20, p > .24].
To further examine error patterns, each child was
designated as a Cue-User (defined as having above 50%
correct), Lexical Mapper (defined as having more than
50% of the errors within pair [i.e., selection of Option
2]), or Random Responder (having 50% or more errors
out of pair [i.e., selection of Option 3 or 4]). For the 5N
children, 6/11 children in the Cued Syntax condition were
designated as Cue-Users. Of the remaining 16 children
(11 of whom were in the Neutral Syntax condition), 13/22
were Lexical Mappers and 3/22 followed a Random strategy. There was no evidence of an Object Kind strategy.
For the 3N children, none were Cue-Users; 9/20 children were designated as Lexical Mappers. The remaining 11 children followed a Random pattern. The majority of the youngest children, then, were unable to map a
new word to one of the two designated objects in the
introducing scene. An Object Kind strategy was not evident in any child's error pattern.
For the 5-SLI children, 2/11 children in the Cued
Syntax condition were Cue-Users. Of the remaining 18
children, 16/20 followed a Lexical Mapping strategy,
whereby they chose the picture of one of the objects that
were presented in the narrative. The final 2 children
followed a Random strategy. In contrast to the majority
of the 3N children, the majority of the 5-SLI children
did recall the targeted objects in the introducing scene,
but were apparently unable to use the syntactic information for differential assignment of names to things.
For none of the children was there evidence of a bias
toward count or mass things. Table 4 summarizes the
results of the error analyses.

Study Two
Methods
Participants
Nineteen 7-year-old children participated in this second study. Because the purpose of this second study was
to examine the growth in ability to use syntactic cues,
all the children were in the Cued Syntax condition. Eight
were children who had been identified as language impaired by a certified speech-language pathologist and
were currently receiving language services in their school
(7-SLI group). Eleven were children who were nonaffected
and developing language typically (7N group). All the children were from monolingual English-speaking homes.

The children in the 7-SLI group ranged in age from
80 to 94 months (M = 85.5, SD = 5.63). The children in
the 7N group ranged in age from 82 to 96 (M = 90.18,
SD = 4.69). The children in both groups displayed intellectual functioning within normal limits as indexed by
a score of 85 or above on the CMMS. The two groups of
children differed in the area of language performance.
On the PPVT-R, the children in the 7-SLI group received
scores below 87, whereas the children in the 7N group
received scores above 98. Table 5 contains a summary
of the identification testing.

Procedures
The children were seen individually in a quiet room
in their school on two occasions. On the first day, the
standardized tests were administered, and on the second day the videotaped story task was completed. The
materials and procedures for the story task were the
same as in Study One.

Results
Preliminary Analyses
T tests were conducted on the identification testing
measures. There was no significant difference in age
between the 7-SLI and 7N groups [t(17) = 1.92, p > .07].
As expected, there was a significant group difference on

PPVT-R standard scores [t(17) = 11.69, p < .000]. A group
difference also existed on the CMMS [t(17) = 3.87, p <
.001]. However, as in the 5-SLI group, the children in
the 7-SLI group displayed intelligence within normal
limits, and thus it was assumed that they knew the difference between count things and mass substances.

Experimental Task
The results from the experimental task for the Cued
Syntax condition are reported in Table 6. An ANOVA
was conducted for the children in the 5-SLI (N = 11), 5N
(N = 11), 7-SLI (N = 8), and 7N (N = 11) groups to look at
the impact of age and language status. The mean scores
for the various groups were 5-SLI: 6.73 (SD = 2.72), 5N:
9.27 (SD = 2.94), 7-SLI: 8.25 (SD = 1.48), 7N: 10.73 (SD
= 1.35). Main effects were seen for age [F(1, 37) = 4.26, p
= .046] and language status [F(1, 37) = 12.21, p = .001].
There was not a significant interaction between the two
factors [F(3, 37) = .002, p = .963].
In addition, the assignment of the 7-year-old children as Cue-User, Lexical Mapper, or Random Responder was determined, and the results compared to
that for the 5-year old groups. In the 7-SLI group, 4/8
(50%) were Cue-Users, and the remaining (4/8, 50%)
were lexical mappers. Recall that for the 5-SLI group,
only 2/11 (18%) were Cue-Users. In the 7N group 11/11
(100%) were Cue-Users, whereas only 6/11 (55%) of the
5N group were Cue-Users. Thus, there was evidence of
growth in the ability to use syntactic cues in both groups
of children.

Discussion
The purpose of these studies was to investigate the
syntactic bootstrapping abilities of children who differed
by language abilities and age. Syntactic bootstrapping,
the use of syntactic cues to aid in word-referent matching, is one mechanism thought to assist in learning new
vocabulary. We were interested in how the morphosyntactic difficulties evident in children with SLI might

be a factor in their weak word learning. In this investigation, we specifically examined the children's ability
to use the morphosyntactic cues associated with the
count/mass distinction to assign novel words to novel
count and mass items. In order to be successful in the
experimental task (i.e., to map each label to its appropriate referent), the child in the syntax-informative condition had to recall both the novel words and novel items
and to then use the syntactic cues (i.e., a vs. some) to establish which word goes with the count item and which
word with the mass item. Children in the syntax-neutral
condition were not given the necessary syntactic cues to
differentiate between the count and mass items.
Results from the first study revealed that only the
5-year-old nonaffected, typically developing children
showed evidence of using the syntactic cues. The 5-yearold SLI group and 3-year-old control group achieved comparable scores. However, error analyses suggested that
different factors were operative in the two groups. The
second study revealed that there was continued growth
into the early school years for children with SLI and
children whose language is developing typically.
Participants' failure to use syntactic cues in this
study could have a number of explanations. One possibility is that the children did not differentiate between
count and mass items. This is unlikely given results of
previous studies documenting the count/mass distinction in children younger than those in the present investigation (Bloom, 1994; Gathercole, 1986; Gordon,
1985; Soja, 1992; Soja et al., 1991). Furthermore, in the
Naming Task in Study One, the majority of children in
all three groups appropriately classified novel count and
mass items as revealed by their use of count terms for
novel count items and mass terms for novel mass items.
This demonstrated that they did have the relevant conceptual distinction. Recall that the few children who
were not classified as differentiated namers produced
ambiguous responses or no responses to the naming task.
They did not produce mass terms for count items and
vise versa. Thus, their responses in this task were not a
clear indication that they did not differentiate between
count and mass items.
Given this evidence that the children could distinguish between count and mass items, their performance
on the experimental task must be explained by other
590

factors. One of these is memory limitations. There is
evidence that these limitations were particularly operative for the 3-year-old control children. Error analyses
revealed that over half of the children in the 3N group
responded randomly in the Experimental Task, choosing an item outside the focused pair as often as one
within the pair. This suggested that they were less able
to recall the critical parts of the introducing scene. The
problem could have been with the memory of the potential referents or the word stem, or both.
Although the 5-year-old children with SLI did not
differ from the 3-year-old children in terms of number
correct on the video task, they did display a distinct error pattern. Ninety percent of the children in this group
chose within the target pair on most trials, suggesting
that they were able to remember the referents and the
word stems. However, there was no difference between
the children in the syntax-informative condition and
those in the syntax-neutral condition. Thus, they were
not able to use the syntactic cues to determine which
label went with the novel count item and which with
the novel mass item. Therefore, factors that could block
utilization of syntactic cues in assignment of novel names
to novel individuated things or substances appear more
important for this group. One of these factors is the ability of the child to use the cues provided by the linguistic
structures. If the associated syntactic cues are not fully
represented in the child's knowledge of the structure,
such cues would not be expected to guide name/thing
pairings (cf. Soja, 1992). This limitation, as predicted,
may have been especially operative for children in the
SLI group, whose use of a in obligatory contexts was
well below mastery (i.e., a mean of 58%). It is important
to note that the spontaneous errors of the SLI children,
as well as the 3N group, were almost all omissions. Errors such as *a dirt were rare. Thus, although there was
optionality in the use of articles, there also was evidence
of distributional use according to noun subcategorizations. However, the children with SLI were not able to
use the available grammatical cues to make the appropriate word-referent mapping in the experimental task.
A second factor that may have blocked the use of
syntactic cues is nonintegration of semantic and syntactic information. It is widely recognized that the syntactic correlates of the count/mass distinction denote
semantic as well as syntactic information (cf. Bloom,
1994; Chierchia, 1994; Gathercole, 1986; Gordon, 1985).
In this experiment, the children who did not benefit from
syntactic cues (i.e., the SLI and 3N groups) at the same
time did demonstrate differentiated naming of the class
of count things and the class of substances on the Naming Task, although neither group performed at conventional levels of mastery for a use. Thus, they had available semantic distinctions that were not fully marked
in their grammar. The frequent omission of a suggests

that the obligatory status of articles before count nouns
was not fully recognized. Children who regard the article a as having some degree of optionality may not fully
appreciate its significance in differentiating individuated things from substances. They may instead rely on
other possible grammatical clues for quantification and
individuation, such as plural marking. Plural morphology appears on count names (e.g., cars), but not mass
nouns (e.g., *waters). Other studies have shown that
SLI children of this age and 3N children have acquired
the plural marker (Oetting & Rice, 1993; Rice & Oetting,
1993), so this cue could be available.
Although the group of typically developing 5-yearold children did demonstrate an ability to use syntactic
cues to assist in word-referent mapping, they were well
below ceiling on the task. The results from Study Two
showed that the ability to use syntactic cues continues
to develop in early school years for children learning
language typically as well as those with specific language
impairment. However, even 7-year-old children were well
below adult-level performance. Thus, there is reason to
exercise caution with the assumption that young children have a robust ability to use grammatical cues as a
guide to word learning and that this ability plays a powerful role in youngsters' early vocabulary acquisition.
In naturalistic learning conditions, this ability may be
hampered by performance constraints, such as memory
limitations, and by incomplete mastery of the informative grammatical contrasts. Thus, in circumstances in
which the performance demands are scaffolded in such
a way as to buffer children from performance limitations, they may be able to attend to and use informative
syntax. In the press of on-line processing of novel words,
however, the informativeness of the grammatical forms
may be lost. Nevertheless, the lexical limitations of the
children with SLI appear to be related to some extent to
their morphological limitations.
Language is a complex system of interrelated dimensions. It is well known that children with SLI often have
difficulties with more than one area of language, but how
these difficulties interact is poorly understood. This study
provides a glimpse of the ways in which morphosyntactic
limitations can interact with lexical limitations to hinder
the ability of children with SLI to learn new words. An
immediate clinical implication is to recognize that efforts to teach the lexicon could benefit from concurrent
attention to the role of determiners in establishing a
novel noun's membership in noun categories such as
count versus mass and the related grammatical properties that ensue from that categorical status.

Appendix. Experimental Script Cued Version (Neutral Version)
This is a story of how Oscar got lots of stuff in his trash
can.
One day Oscar was just sitting beside his trash can when
a stranger came by. She was cleaning out her purse. (A person
is going through her purse. She takes two items out and puts
them on the tray sitting on the table.) "I found a (my) keelwug
and some (my) blick" said the woman. "I don't need a (my)
keelwug and some (my) blick. I'm going to throw a (the)
keelwug and some (the) blick away."
"Where is she gonna throw a (the) keelwug and some
(the) blick?" wondered Oscar.
Just then, the woman dumped a (the)keelwug and some
(the) blick into Oscar's trash can. (woman dumps items in the
can) "I can't believe it," said Oscar. "That woman threw a (the)
keelwug and some (the) blick in my trash can."
"I have too much stuff in my purse," said the woman. "It is
so heavy. (bring out second pair) Some (my) geeder and a
(my) pel. Maybe I should get rid of some (the) geeder and a
(the) pel too. I know. I'll just throw some (the) geeder and a
(the) pel into this trash can."
"Is she really gonna put some (the) geeder and a (the) pel
into my can," cried Oscar.
The woman threw some (the) geeder and a (the) pel into
Oscar's can.
"Not again," cried Oscar. "That woman threw some (the)
geeder and a (the) pel in my trash can."
"Let's see if I have any more trash in here," said the
woman. Maybe I can throw some other things out." (take out
third pair). "Here's a (my) didum and some (my) pleen. I don't
really need a (the) didum and some (the) pleen any more. If I
throw a (the) didum and some (the) pleen out my purse will be
much lighter."
"Not a (the) didum and some (the) pleen in my can,"
whined Oscar.
The woman dumped a (the) didum and some (the) pleen
into Oscar's trash can.
(woman walks away)
"Why did that woman do that?" complained Oscar.

"Why did she dump a (the) didum and some (the) pleen
into my trash can."
Then the woman came back.
"Someone left some (the) payleen and a (the) troke on the
street," said the woman. "some (the) payleen and a (the)
troke. I don't need some (the) payleen and a (the) troke. I'll
put them in this trash can, too."
"Here we go again," cried Oscar. "That woman is going
to dump some (the) payleen and a (the) troke in my can."
The woman threw some (the) payleen and a (the) troke
into Oscar's trash can.
(woman walks away)
Oscar wasn't very happy. But then he looked inside his
trash can. "Hey, my can looks pretty good," thought Oscar.
"That woman made a great mess with some (the) payleen and
a (the) troke."
"I sure hope somebody else comes by," thought Oscar.
"My trash can would look really great if I had just a little more
junk."
(second person enters)
Just then, Oscar's friend, Pam, came by with the lovely
box of junk. Oscar really wanted some of the junk for his trash
can.
"Hi Pam," said Oscar. "Where are you going?"
"I'm just going to throw this junk out," replied Pam. "I
don't need it any more."
"What have you got in there?" wondered Oscar.
(takes out items and puts them on the tray)
"A (my) naket and some (my) spet." answered Pam. "I
have a (the) naket and some (the) spet. I don't need a (the)
naket and some (the) spet any more so I'm gonna take them to
the dump."
"To the dump!" cried Oscar. "I want a (the) naket and
some (the) spet. Can I have them?"
"I guess so" said Pam, and she dumped a (the) naket and
some (the) spet into Oscar's trash can.
"Hey," said Oscar, "A (the) naket and some (the) spet

make my can look much better."
"What else have you got?" asked Oscar.
(pulls out second pair and puts them on the tray)
"Some (my) pomen and a (my) dute. I'm throwing some
(the) pomen and a (the) dute away" explained Pam. "I don't
want some (the) pomen and a (the) dute."
"I could use some (the) pomen and a (the) dute," said
Oscar.
"Here you go," said Pam as she dumped some (the)
pomen and a (the) dute into Oscar's can.
(dumps items into the can)

Oscar looked in his can. "Thanks a lot. My can looks
much trashier now with a (the) mopat and some (the) sim."
"Do you want these other things too?" asked Pam.
"What things?" wondered Oscar.
(take out 8th pair)
"Some (my) kamet and a (my) weem," replied Pam. I
have some (the) kamet and a (the) weem in here too. I was
going to throw them out but if you want some (the) kamet and
a (the) weem you can have them."
"I'll take some (the) kamet and a (the) weem if you don't
want them," offered Oscar.

"Gee thanks," said Oscar, "I really like the way some (the)
pomen and a (the) dute look in my can."

"They're all yours," said Pam and she threw some (the)
kamet and a (the) weem in Oscar's trash can. (dumps stuff in)

"Is that all the stuff you have?" asked Oscar. "I still have
some more room in my can."

"Look at that," said Oscar. "Some (the) kamet and a (the)
weem look great in my can."

"Well," said Pam. (take out seventh pair) "I also have a
(my) mopat and some (my) sim. I can give you a (the) mopat
and some (the) sim. Do you really want a (the) mopat and
some (the) sim?"
"I sure do," replied Oscar. "I would love a (the) mopat
and some (the) sim."
"Alright," said Pam as she put a (the) mopat and some
(the) sim in the can.

Then the first woman came back.
"Hi Mary," said Pam. "Oscar, this is my friend Mary."
"You're the woman who put all that junk in my trash can,"
said Oscar.
"This is your trash can?" said Mary.
"Yeah," said Oscar, "Look at how great my can looks with
all that trash."
