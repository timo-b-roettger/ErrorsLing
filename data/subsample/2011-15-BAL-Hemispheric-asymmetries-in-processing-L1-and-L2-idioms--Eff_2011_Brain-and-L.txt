This study investigates the contribution of the left and right hemispheres to the comprehension of bilingual figurative language and the joint effects of salience and context on the differential cerebral involvement in idiom processing. The divided visual field and the lexical decision priming paradigms were
employed to examine the activation of salient and nonsalient ambiguous idiom interpretations (i.e.,
literal vs. non-literal) in the two hemispheres. Literally plausible ambiguous idioms, L1 (Polish) and L2
(English), were embedded in unconstraining ambiguous (e.g., I knew he kept an ace up his sleeve) or constraining unambiguous context clearly favoring their conventional idiomatic interpretation (e.g., The
debating president kept an ace up his sleeve). Idioms were presented centrally, followed by laterally
presented targets related to the figurative (e.g., GAIN) or literal (e.g., SHIRT) meaning of the idiom and displayed at Interstimulus Intervals (ISIs) of 0 ms (Experiment 1), 300 ms (Experiment 2), and 800 ms
(Experiment 3). Results indicate that context and salience effects are significantly modulated by the
language (native vs. nonnative) of the stimulus materials being presented to each hemisphere. Literal
facilitation was found for L2 idioms in all three ISI conditions, which supports the notion of the special
status that literal meanings of L2 idioms enjoy in the course of their processing by nonnative language
users. No significant differences were found between the right and left hemispheres in regards to their
sensitivity to contextual constraints. Results are discussed in terms of the Graded Salience Hypothesis
and the Fine/Coarse Coding Theory.

1. Introduction
Significant progress has been made in research on hemispheric
lateralization and cerebral asymmetries in language processing.
Traditionally, the left hemisphere (LH) has been seen as specializing
in syntactic and literal processing, whereas the right hemisphere
(RH) in metaphorical processing (e.g., Anaki, Faust, & Kravetz,
1998; Burgess & Chiarello, 1996; Shields, 1991; Van Lancker-Sidtis,
2006). This approach, known as the right hemisphere theory (see
Rapp, Leube, Erb, Grodd, & Kircher, 2004, 2007), has ascribed the
RH a key role in processing non-literal language and complex,
indirect speech forms like irony, sarcasm, or humor. The right
hemisphere hypothesis has been supported by studies of right
hemisphere damaged (RBD) patients, who displayed deficits in

comprehending various forms of figurative language such as connotative meanings of polysemous words, idioms, metaphors, indirect
requests, speech formulas, or ironic statements (Brownell, Potter,
Michelow, & Gardner, 1984; Brownell, Simpson, Bihrle, & Gardner,
1990; Champagne, Virbel, Nespoulous, & Joanette, 2003). Some of
these studies (e.g., Van Lancker & Kempler, 1987; Winner & Gardner,
1977) have been criticized for methodological shortcomings
regarding the use of pictorial stimuli which pose an extra processing
load related to visuo-spatial skills (e.g., Anaki et al., 1998; Papagno,
Curti, Rizzo, Crippa, & Colombo, 2006).
Subsequent research with clinical populations has failed to
provide unequivocal support for the traditional view of cerebral differences in literal and non-literal language processing (e.g., Kasher,
Batori, Soroker, Graves, & Zaidel, 2002; Nocentini et al., 2006;
Soroker et al., 2005; Zaidel, Kasher, Soroker, & Batori, 2002). Additional studies with healthy populations and employing different
methodologies, such as hemifield priming, have likewise yielded
mixed findings with regard to the right hemisphere hypothesis.
For instance, in a divided visual field experiment by Anaki et al.
(1998) literal priming was obtained only in the rvf/LH, while metaphorical priming was present in both visual fields at a short SOA and
only in the lvf/RH at a long SOA. However, subsequent research with

A.B. Cieslicka, R.R. Heredia / Brain & Language 116 (2011) 136-150

hemifield priming methodology failed to replicate Anaki et al.'s results (e.g., Coulson & Van Petten, 2007; Kacinik & Chiarello, 2007).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies are also inconsistent with regard to cerebral asymmetries in processing metaphorical language. Thus, in a positron emission tomography (PET)
study, Bottini et al. (1994) found increased cerebral blood flow in
various areas of the right hemisphere during the processing of metaphoric, but not literal sentences. On the other hand, using eventrelated functional magnetic resonance imaging (ER-fMRI), Rapp
et al. (2004) reported the strongest activation in the anterior part
of the left inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyri during
reading metaphorical, as opposed to literal sentences. Similarly,
an fMRI study by Lee and Dapretto (2006) showed an increased
LH activity in fronto-temporal regions for metaphorical, as compared to literal, word-triads (see also Shibata, Abe, Terao, &
Miyamoto, 2007; Stringaris, Medford, Giampietro, Brammer, & David, 2007; but see Rapp et al., 2007 who found left lateralization for
both metaphoric and literal sentences).
The majority of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies
have focused on metaphors and examined their comprehension
exclusively in the monolingual setting. Although idioms constitute
an integral part of popular speech for native and nonnative speakers (e.g., Hoffman, 1980), they have received much less attention.
Briefly, idioms are traditionally defined as multi-word phraseological units, whose meaning is not predictable from their constituent
parts (Fraser, 1970; Makkai, 1972; Weinreich, 1969). Similar to
studies into the processing of metaphors, research into idioms
has failed to provide support for the unique role of the right hemisphere in figurative language processing. For example, studies with
clinical populations employing pictorial and verbal tasks showed
severely impaired idiom comprehension in aphasic individuals
with left brain lesions (Cacciari et al., 2006; Nenonen, Niemi, &
Laine, 2002; Papagno & Caporali, 2007; Papagno & Genoni, 2004;
Papagno, Tabossi, Colombo, & Zampetti, 2004). In Papagno et al.'s
(2006) string-to-picture matching study, both RBD and LBD
patients were impaired in their comprehension of idiomatic
sentences and displayed a strong literal bias. Contrary to predictions of the right hemisphere hypothesis, the RBD patients performed better than the LBD ones, though performance varied
depending on their visuo-spatial deficits and lesion site, with
lesions in the prefrontal cortex related to impaired idiom performance. Overall, studies with aphasic individuals seem to indicate
that both hemispheres are needed to successfully comprehend
and produce (Baum & Titone, 2005) figurative meanings (but see
Hillert, 2004), the view further supported by research into non-literal language comprehension by adults with agenesis of the corpus
callosum (Paul, Van Lancker-Sidtis, Schieffer, Dietrich, & Brown,
2003). Apparently, callosal absence reduces both the quantity
and efficiency of interhemispheric transfer and interaction, leading
to impairments in processing pragmatic and paralinguistic information (see also Huber-Okrainec, Blaser, & Dennis, 2005).
Mixed results with regard to cerebral asymmetries in idiom
processing have also emerged from neuroimaging studies with
healthy participants. For instance, Oliveri, Romero, and Papagno
(2004) showed reduced comprehension accuracy in processing idioms following left hemisphere repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS). In another rTMS study, Fogliata et al. (2007)
found impaired accuracy on a sentence-to-picture matching task
following stimulation applied to the left prefrontal cortex 80 ms
and 120 ms after the presentation of the picture. On the other
hand, Romero Lauro, Tettamanti, Cappa, and Papagno (2008) found
common bilateral neural network for processing idiomatic and
literal sentences while participants were performing a sentenceto-picture matching task. Compared to literal sentences, idioms
elicited greater cortical activity in a bilateral network including
fronto-temporal regions in both hemispheres, with left-sided prev-

137

alence in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left temporal cortex, and
the left superior medial frontal gyrus. Increase in bilateral activation of the IFG is taken to reflect the selection process necessary
to inhibit the competing literal alternative and to choose the correct figurative interpretation (see also Cacciari et al., 2006; Papagno, Lucchelli, Muggia, & Rizzo, 2003; Schettino et al., 2010 for a
similar claim with regard to impaired idiom processing in clinical
populations). The crucial role of bilateral prefrontal cortex in idiom
comprehension was also reported in an rTMS study by Rizzo, Sandrini, and Papagno (2007) who found reduced RTs and accuracy for
idiomatic stimuli in a sentence-to-picture matching task following
both left and right rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (see
also Zempleni, Haverkort, Renken, & Stowe, 2007).
Giora, Zaidel, Soroker, Batori, and Kasher (2000) suggested that
it is not so much the literal vs. non-literal distinction that determines LH and RH involvement, but instead salience of the language
material being processed (see Giora's Graded Salience Hypothesis
(GSH); 1997, 1999, 2002, 2003). Controversial results obtained in
cerebral activation studies might be explained by the differential
salience of the stimuli employed, rather than experimental techniques or design differences. For example, whereas the study by
Bottini et al. used more complex metaphorical expressions, thus
resulting in greater activation of the RH, other studies (e.g., Rapp
et al., 2004, Lee & Dapretto, 2006) employed familiar, conventional
metaphors, whose meaning might be more lexicalized and retrieved as a unit, and so they demonstrated higher LH activations.
In line with the GSH, increased activation of the RH in an effort to
process nonsalient meaning and more complex semantic information is called for while computing relations between the elements
of a novel figurative expression. In turn, retrieval of lexicalized conventional metaphors mainly engages the LH, consistent with the
imaging studies showing involvement of the left inferior gyrus
and left temporal regions in lexical access (Eviatar & Just, 2006;
Lee & Dapretto, 2006; Rapp et al., 2004; Stringaris et al., 2007).
Higher activation of the RH in processing nonsalient meanings
is consistent with predictions of the Fine-Coarse Coding Theory
(FCT) (Beeman, 1998; Jung-Beeman, 2005), which postulates a fine
coding and strong activation of small and focused semantic fields
in the LH and a weak activation of large and diffuse semantic fields
in the RH. Jointly, the GSH and FCT predict that, while a few salient,
either literal or metaphorical meanings, are quickly activated in
the LH, the RH may activate a wide range of nonsalient literal
and metaphorical meanings and maintain their activation for a
longer period of time (Faust & Mashal, 2007; Schmidt, DeBuse, &
Seger, 2007). The GSH and FCT have received support from a range
of studies employing metaphorical and idiomatic stimuli (e.g.,
Arzouan, Goldstein, & Faust, 2007; Faust, Ben-Artzi, & Harel,
2008; Fogliata et al., 2007; Laurent, Denhieres, Passerieux, Iakimova, & Hardy-Bayle, 2006; Mashal, Faust, & Hendler, 2005; Mashal,
Faust, Hendler, & Jung-Beeman, 2007, 2008; Oliveri et al., 2004;
Stringaris et al., 2006). For example, in a dvf experiment testing
ambiguous idioms, Stowe, Zempleni, and Hoeks (2003) showed
that, for idioms embedded in figurative-bias context, only salient
(idiomatic) meanings became activated in the LH, whereas both
salient and nonsalient meanings showed facilitation in the RH.
Laurent et al. (2006) also showed that, depending on idioms' salience, either their idiomatic (for high-salience idioms) or literal
(for low-salience idioms) meaning was primarily automatically
activated, leading to the increased speed in the processing of subsequent compatible (figurative or literal) target word. Electrophysiological measures corroborated those results, showing smaller
N400 amplitude for the idiomatic, as compared to the literal meaning following salient idioms. Another recent dvf/fMRI study (Mashal et al., 2008) tested the joint predictions of the GSH and FCT
during the processing of literally plausible, and thus ambiguous,
idiomatic expressions. The RT data showed substantial facilitation

138

A.B. Cieslicka, R.R. Heredia / Brain & Language 116 (2011) 136-150

for targets related literally only in the RH, whereas comparable
priming effects were found in the LH for targets related figuratively. The fMRI data further indicated that the processing of nonsalient, literal interpretations of idioms evoked greater activation
of the RH regions, whereas processing salient meanings of idioms
increased activation in the left brain regions, including the left
inferior frontal gyrus. Support for the involvement of the left prefrontal cortex in idiom processing was also reported by Hillert
and Buracas (2009) in an ER-fMRI study which examined comprehension of spoken literally plausible and implausible idioms. The
two idiom types engaged different neural substrates, with literally
implausible idiomatic expressions primarily activating Broca's area
and adjacent regions, and literally plausible ones engaging the left
superior temporal gyrus and left medial frontal gyrus.
In addition to salience, context has been shown to significantly
affect cerebral asymmetries and the combined predictions of the
GSH and FCT have been employed to account for the observed patterns of contextually compatible and incompatible meaning activation. Accordingly, it has been suggested that the LH is superior in
using sentence-level information to facilitate lexical access,
whereas the RH processes meanings via word-level, intra-lexical
mechanisms. Cerebral asymmetries in reliance on message-level
vs. word-level mechanisms for sentence comprehension were verified in studies employing structured (sentences) or unstructured
(word lists) primes (e.g., Faust, Babkoff, & Kravetz, 1995; Faust &
Chiarello, 1998a), manipulating the degree of message-level constraint (Faust & Kravetz, 1998) or contextual appropriateness of
dominant and subordinate meanings of ambiguous words embedded in sentences (Faust & Chiarello, 1998b; Faust & Gernsbacher,
1996; for a review see Faust, Bar-lev, & Chiarell, 2003). However,
not all studies have been unanimous with regard to cerebral asymmetries in context sensitivity. Federmeier and Kutas (1999) found
equal sensitivity for both hemispheres to laterally presented unexpected endings of sentences, as indexed by the amplitudes of N400
responses elicited for rvf/LH and lvf/RH presentations. Further support for the view that the RH can benefit from message-level information was obtained in a range of studies specifically focusing on
word- and sentence-level influences on patterns of hemispheric
activation (e.g., Chiarello, Liu, & Faust, 2001; Coulson, Kutas,
Federmeier, & Van Petten, 2005; Coulson & Van Petten, 2007; Faust
et al., 2003; Gouldthorp & Coney, 2009; Wlotko & Federmeier,
2007). These findings are consistent with the literature suggesting
involvement of the RH in discourse-level processing and its increased activity as contextual complexity increases (e.g., Beeman,
Bowden, & Gernsbacher, 2000; Ben-Artzi, Faust, & Moeller, 2009;
Brownell & Martino, 1998; Coulson & Williams, 2005; Faust, Barak,
& Chiarello, 2006; Gardner, Brownell, Wapner, & Michelow, 1983;
Xu, Kemeny, Park, Frattali, & Braun, 2005).
While predictions of the GSH and FCT regarding salience and
context have been extensively tested in monolingual studies, surprisingly little research has been undertaken into the processing
of figurative expressions in general, and idiomatic expressions in
particular, by second language learners/bilingual language users.
The paucity of research into idiomatic language processing by bilinguals/second language users is surprising, given the widely
established fact that they pose difficulties for second language
learners (Alexander, 1987; Cacciari, 1993; Fernando, 1996; Gairns
& Redman, 1986; Irujo, 1993; Kovesces & Szabo, 1996; Lattey,
1986; McCarthy, 1990; Moon, 1997; Zughoul, 1991). The purpose
of the present set of experiments is therefore to address this gap
and investigate the role of salience and context in the processing
of literally plausible (ambiguous) idiomatic expressions by bilingual speakers. In light of the possible differences between native
language (L1) and nonnative language (L2) idioms in relation to
which meaning (literal vs. figurative) is more salient, we explore
how predictions of the Graded Salience Hypothesis will interact

with language and whether the prevalence of literal meaning activation in L2 figurative processing (e.g., Cieslicka, 2006; Kecskes,
2000; Liontas, 2002) will be reflected in differential hemispheric
activity for L1 and L2 idioms. Given the equivocal nature of the previous findings concerning cerebral asymmetries in contextual sensitivity, another goal of the present study is to further assess
differences between the ways the two hemispheres employ context in resolving ambiguity during on-line processing of idiomatic
expressions. Like ambiguous words, ambiguous idioms contain
dominant (salient) figurative meanings and subordinate (nonsalient) literal meanings.
2. The present study
This study attempted to explore joint predictions of the GSH
and FCT theories which have been so far tested only with monolingual participants. We employed the divided visual field paradigm
combined with lexical decision priming, and used literally plausible ambiguous idioms, both L1 (Polish) and L2 (English), which
were embedded either in unconstraining ambiguous (e.g., All this
time I knew he kept an ace up his sleeve) or constraining unambiguous context clearly favoring their conventional idiomatic interpretation (e.g., For the debate the president kept an ace up his sleeve).
Idioms were presented centrally, followed by laterally presented
target words related to the figurative (e.g., GAIN) or literal (e.g.,
SHIRT) meaning of the idiom. Since it has been argued (e.g., Klepousniotou & Baum, 2005) that short intervals (e.g., 200 ms) measure immediate activation process, while longer intervals (e.g.,
500 ms) measure later post-access selection processes, we included three different Interstimulus Intervals (ISIs). Also, many
hemifield studies have contrasted only two ISIs or have investigated ISIs within a very narrow time window, which might make
it difficult to precisely determine the onset of priming in both
hemispheres and the subsequent narrowing down of the LH priming (Chiarello, Liu, Shears, Quan, & Kacinik, 2003). To explore the
time-course of meaning activation in both hemispheres and inspect meanings activation early during language comprehension,
an ISI of 0 ms was included. As the main responses to linguistic
material, including semantic processing, occur within 500 ms from
stimulus onset (see Faust & Mashal, 2007), an ISI of 300 ms was
used to test possible cerebral asymmetries this early during idiom
processing. Finally, a long delay of 800 ms was included, in order to
track down the maintenance of activation and suppression of contextually inappropriate meanings in both hemispheres (see Faust &
Chiarello, 1998a,b; Faust & Kahana, 2002; Faust & Mashal, 2007;
Kacinik & Chiarello, 2007; Titone, 1998, for the rationale of using
different ISIs in hemifield research).
The picture emerging from numerous studies using the divided
visual paradigm shows complex and varying patterns of activation
of salient and nonsalient meanings in various time windows.
Accordingly, at very early time-courses (SOAs below 100 ms) bilateral priming for the most dominant (salient) meanings has been reported, with rvf/LH priming for subordinate (nonsalient) meanings
and lvf/RH exhaustive priming observed at even shorter delays (below 50 ms). Moderately longer SOAs (80-200 ms) have shown a
pattern of activation consistent with exhaustive access of both
dominant and subordinate meanings in both visual fields, whereas
for later time-courses (around 750 ms SOA), the LH has shown activation of only the dominant, contextually compatible meaning,
with the RH maintaining exhaustive activation of salient and nonsalient meanings (see Faust & Kahana, 2002, Chiarello et al., 2003
for discussion of a time-course of left and right visual field priming). Instead of hypothesizing about literal vs. figurative meaning
activation for both hemispheres over the three ISIs employed, we
make general predictions concerning earlier availability and more
facilitation for either literal or figurative meanings of idioms as a

A.B. Cieslicka, R.R. Heredia / Brain & Language 116 (2011) 136-150

function of language and visual field. Also, since previous research
has indicated that differences between hemispheres are much
more pronounced at relatively later stages, after strategic processing and suppression of contextually irrelevant meanings have already started in the LH (Burgess & Simpson, 1988; Chiarello,
Maxfield, & Kahan, 1995; Faust & Gernsbacher, 1996), we expected
those differential patterns to unfold across the longer ISIs that we
employed.
Since idiomatic expressions are highly conventionalized fixed
phrases, whose figurative meaning is strongly coded in the lexicon,
the prediction for L1 idioms was that their salient figurative meanings would be available faster in the left hemisphere than in the
right hemisphere, consistent with the GSH and FCT. Responses to
idiomatically related targets should be facilitated sooner and to a
larger extent in the rvf/LH than in the lvf/RH. Since the figurative
meaning of L2 idioms is less likely to be well coded in the mental
lexicon, their literal meaning might turn out to be as salient as, or
even more salient than, their figurative interpretation (e.g., Cieslicka, 2006; Kecskes, 2000; Liontas, 2002). Therefore, we predicted
more priming for literal targets, overall, relative to the L1 condition. Moreover, given that L2 figurative meanings might be less
salient, figuratively related targets should be primed more in the
lvf/RH than in the rvf/LH.
We also explored the influence of context on the activation of
salient and nonsalient idiom meanings. If predictions of the GSH
and FCT with regard to cerebral asymmetries in contextual sensitivity are viable, both figurative and literal targets should show
similar activation in the lvf/RH, irrespective of whether the idioms
are embedded in ambiguous or unambiguous context. Maintenance of a contextually incompatible literal interpretation of an
idiom by the RH would be in line with the view that the RH keeps
this alternative meaning active, as potentially useful in constructing the idiomatic interpretations of the utterance (cf. Giora's, 2002
retention hypothesis). In comparison, the LH should quickly engage in the suppression of contextually irrelevant meanings, so
there should be much less facilitation for contextually incompatible literal targets in unambiguous than in ambiguous context,
and significantly more facilitation for figurative targets in unambiguous, relative to ambiguous context, in the rvf/LH. Alternatively,
both hemispheres might benefit from contextual support, in which
case RTs to literal targets should be slower in unambiguous than in
ambiguous context and RTs to figurative targets faster in unambiguous than in ambiguous context, in both visual fields. The research
questions are summarized as follows: (1) Will there be more priming for salient, figurative meanings of L1 idioms in the rvf/LH than
in the lvf/RH, in line with the joint predictions of the GSH/FCT? (2)
Will the processing patterns obtained for L1 idioms diverge in the
L2 idiom condition, so that there will be more priming for nonsalient, figurative meanings of L2 idioms in the lvf/RH than in the
rvf/LH and there will be overall more literal meaning activation
in both hemispheres? (3) Will the RH be less sensitive to contextual constraints than the LH?
2.1. Materials and methods
2.1.1. Participants
A total of 120 graduate students (97 females, 23 males, aged
21-25) volunteered as participants. Forty students were assigned
to each ISI condition. All participants were native speakers of Polish and highly proficient in English at Adam Mickiewicz University,
Poznan, Poland. They were all late bilinguals who started learning
English after the age of 10 through formal instruction. They were
graduate students of the English Philology, which offers intensive
English-only curriculum and verifies students' proficiency every
year with a set of standardized language exams, corresponding to
levels of difficulty as defined within the Common European Frame-

139

work of Reference for Languages (CEF). The participants recruited
for the experiment had all successfully passed their Practical English Language Examination administered as part of their English
Philology end-of-year evaluation and equivalent to Level C2 (Proficient Speaker - Mastery) within the CEF (equivalent to Cambridge
Proficiency Examination administered by Cambridge University).
Self-report language background questionnaire revealed that all
participants used predominantly Polish on an everyday basis, except when at School, and their dominant language was Polish. All
participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and all
yielded a laterality quotient of at least +80 on the Edinburgh Inventory, indicating right-handedness (Oldfield, 1971).
2.1.2. Stimuli
For all experiments, the stimuli consisted of 40 idiomatic sentences for each (English and Polish) condition, paired with 40 target words, as well as 20 control sentences and 40 filler sentences
paired with nonwords. For both the Polish and English conditions,
20 familiar, literally plausible ambiguous idiomatic expressions
were chosen. The idioms used had a familiarity (i.e., how familiar
the idiom is) and literality (i.e., the extent to which an idiom has
a well-formed literal interpretation) mean rating of 6.0. English
idiom familiarity (1 = not familiar, 7 = very familiar) and literality
(1 = no literal interpretation, 7 = clear and well-formed literal
interpretation) ratings were obtained from a sample of 80 Polish
students of English. Idioms were taken from Longman Idiom Dictionary (1998). Polish idioms were obtained from Baba and Liberek
(2002) and normed on 120 Polish students. The norming of these
idioms followed the same procedure as the English ones. Idioms
were also rated for transparency, i.e., the degree to which figurative meaning can be derived from the figuration that they involve
(such as metaphor and hyperbole, e.g., take the bull by the horn; see
Nunberg, Sag, & Wasow, 1994) A score ranging from 1 to 7 was assigned, where 1 = completely opaque, impossible to derive the figurative meaning and 7 = completely transparent, easily derivable
meaning. The rating score for Polish idioms varied from 2.40 to
4.90 (M = 3.60) and for English from 1.70 to 4.10 (M = 3.40),
p > .05. Idioms in both Polish and English blocks had similar transparency ratings, with the mean for transparent idioms M = 3.90 in
the Polish and M = 3.80 in the English block, and the mean for opaque idioms M = 3.10 in the Polish and M = 2.90 in the English block
(p's > .05). All of the idioms had comparable syntactic structure,
which included a verb phrase, consisting of a verb and a prepositional phrase (e.g., be in the saddle, sit on the fence), a verb and a
noun phrase (kick the bucket, blow the whistle), or a verb, noun
phrase and prepositional phrase (keep an ace up your sleeve, let
the cat out of the bag).
Each idiom was embedded in an ambiguous and unambiguous
sentence context. For the ambiguous condition, the preceding context did not bias the figurative meaning of the idiom. It was constructed in such a way that the idiom could be read figuratively
(e.g., I know he is very happy to be in the saddle). However, the idiom
could conceivably be read in terms of its literal meaning. For the
unambiguous condition, the preceding context was biased toward
the idiomatic interpretation (e.g., It looks like liberals are again going
to be in the saddle). Within each language block, all the stimulus
sentences were matched in length (12 words for the English block
and 9 for the Polish block). Two types of target words were further
constructed for each idiomatic sentence, a figurative target, which
was related to the figurative meaning of the idiom (e.g., RULE), and
a literal target, related to its literal meaning (e.g., HORSE). These
targets were generated in a word association pre-test by Polish-
English bilinguals. Items selected as figurative and literal targets
consisted of four to six letters in the English condition and of six
to eight letters in the Polish condition. Independent t-tests

target conditions. Whereas in the ambiguous context condition,
both target words were potentially compatible with the preceding
idiom, depending on whether it was interpreted figuratively or literally (e.g., All this time I knew he kept an ace up his sleeve - GAIN,
SHIRT), in the unambiguous context (For the debate the presidential
candidate kept an ace up his sleeve) only the figurative target (GAIN)
was compatible, whereas the literal target (SHIRT) was incompatible with the meaning of the idiom primed by the context.
To control for effects of word differences on latency, each word
employed as a related (figurative or literal) target was used again
with another sentence as an unrelated (control) target. Twenty
non-idiomatic control sentences were created for each set of figurative and literal targets. These sentences were unrelated to the meaning of the targets they were paired with. For example, the literal
target HORSE was paired with a control sentence of the type, Jane
is half German and half Dutch so her children are bilingual. The priming
effect was thus measured as facilitation in responses to figurative/
literal targets following idiomatic sentences relative to when the
same targets followed control sentences. Table 1 provides examples
of stimulus items across the six different conditions.
In addition, 40 filler sentences were matched with nonword targets. Nonwords were constructed from words altered by changing
one or two letters and were all orthographically legal and pronounceable. The filler sentences were identical in length to the idiomatic and control sentences; likewise, the length of nonword
targets was identical to that of Polish and English related target
items. Four lists were needed in each language block to completely
counterbalance the items over the experimental conditions, across
lists. Each sentence and each target appeared only once per list.
To validate the stimulus materials, several norming experiments were conducted. First, thirty Polish students of English were
presented with a complete list of idiomatic sentences (e.g., I am
telling you, you should not add fuel to the fire), and three possible options, a figurative (e.g., Don't make things worse), a literal (e.g., Don't
pour this substance into the fire), and an inappropriate interpretation (e.g., I know you'd like to have a fireplace). Students were to
choose the best plausible interpretation. Overall, 99% of participants consistently selected the figurative interpretation for contexts biasing the figurative meaning of the idiom. For the
ambiguous context condition, 73% chose both the figurative and
literal options as plausible interpretations, indicating that the preceding unbiased context of the idiom was indeed ambiguous and
allowed two plausible meanings of the idiomatic phrases. Next,
target words from the word association pre-test were rated by
an independent group of 20 Polish students of English. Half of
the participants rated literal and half figurative targets. The three
most frequent literal and figurative associates obtained from the
norming study were presented along with a list of idioms and
the instruction to rate each word on a 1-5 scale (1 = not associated
at all, 5 = very much associated, to idiom). Only literal and figurative targets with a mean rating of 4.0 or above were selected.
Moreover, all words chosen had comparable word frequency,
imageability, concreteness, and word class, p's > .05. Finally,
targets matched with control sentences were rated by 15 Polish
students of English Philology according to whether they were related or unrelated. Participants were presented with the control
sentences paired with figurative and literal targets and asked to

indicate on a 1 (not related at all) to 5 (very much related) scale
whether the word was in any way related to the meaning of the
preceding sentence. All of the targets received a relatedness mean
rating below 1.5.
2.1.3. Design
For all experiments, a 2(Language: Polish vs. English)  3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Visual Field:
Right vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) repeated measures design was used. The primary dependent measure was reaction time, but the percentage of errors was also
calculated.
2.1.4. Apparatus and procedure
Stimulus presentation and data collection were controlled by
E-Prime Software. All stimuli were displayed in black (Verdana,
18 pts), against a white background on an LCD SyncMaster 940 N
monitor with a screen resolution of 1280  1024 pixels. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental lists in such a
way that 10 subjects were run on each of the four stimulus lists
in each experiment. They were tested individually in a darkened,
sound-attenuated room in a single session consisting of two experimental blocks (Polish and English) of 80 trials each. The order of
block presentation was randomized for each subject. Experimental
blocks were preceded by a practice block, consisting of 30 items.
Position of target display (left vs. right to fixation point) and hand
of the response (left vs. right) were evenly practiced. Participants
were seated approximately 50 cm from the monitor screen, with
their heads stabilized by a chin-rest individually adjusted for each
person. Each trial began with a fixation point presented centrally
for 1000 ms. Immediately after, a sentence was presented centrally, one word at a time. Each word's presentation duration was
a function of its number of characters plus a constant (see Faust
& Gernsbacher, 1996). The constant of 300 ms was set for Polish
words and of 400 ms for English words. The function was
16.7 ms per character for L1 and 16.7 ms plus 1=4 of that value for
L2. This procedure was verified with pilot testing, which indicated
that sentences could be read and comprehended when presented
within such a time frame. Immediately after sentence presentation,
a fixation point appeared in the center of the screen and remained
visible until the participant's response to ensure full fixation. The
target word appeared immediately at sentence offset (Experiment
1), 300 ms (Experiment 2), or 800 ms (Experiment 3) after sentence
offset. Target was in uppercase font and presented for 150 ms (pilot testing indicated that this timing was sufficient for reading and
comprehension), with the center falling 2.6 to the left or right of
the fixation sign. Targets subtended, on average, 1.60 of horizontal
visual angle. The target word disappeared after 150 ms and only
the fixation point remained on the screen. The next trial began
when a response was made or, in case when no response was provided, after 3000 ms response time window. Participants were told
that the aim of the experiment was to explore how language users
can process words in L1 and L2 that they are not directly focusing
on. They were instructed to read each sentence, one word at a time,
and decide, as rapidly and accurately as possible, whether the subsequent target string presented to the right or left of the fixation
point was a legal English or Polish word. A GO/NO GO protocol

was employed, in which GO (word) decisions were made by pressing a designated keyboard key with the index finger and NO GO
(nonword) decisions by withholding response (see Chiarello,
1988, 1998; Koivisto, 1998; Neely, 1991 for the rationale of using
GO/NO GO procedures in the dvf studies; see also Chiarello et al.,
2003; Shears & Chiarello, 2003).
To ensure that the load on each hemisphere was balanced as
evenly as possible (e.g., Coney, 1998), for half the trials participants
used their right hand index finger to respond. For the other half of
the trials they responded with their left hand index finger. Participants were also instructed to read the sentences for understanding, since a comprehension test was to be administered after the
experiment. Each session lasted approximately 30 min and was
followed by a comprehension test and a debriefing session. The
comprehension test included 80 sentences, half in Polish and half
in English, half of which were included in the experimental lists.
Participants' task was to choose the sentences they had read during
the experiment. Response rates for participants were highly accurate (85% or greater).
3. Results
3.1. Experiment 1: 0 ms ISI
Only correct responses were used for the statistical analysis
(92% of all the data). The distribution of errors was comparable
(5.8% errors on figurative targets, 5% errors on literal targets, 7% errors on nonwords in the Polish condition; 4.5% errors on figurative
targets, 3.9% errors on literal targets, 6% errors on nonwords in the
English condition), and the analysis on error rates revealed no significant effects or trends, so only RT responses were subjected to
further analysis. There was no evidence for speed-accuracy tradeoffs. RTs with two standard deviations (SDs) above or below the
mean were removed from the analysis (0.6% in the Polish and
0.4% in the English condition). Two subjects failed to reach the
required threshold of 75% correct responses so their RT data were
removed as well. The overall 2(Language: Polish vs. English) 
3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Visual
Field: Right vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal)
ANOVA revealed a main effect of context both by subjects,
F1(2, 64) = 9.49, p < .001, and by items, F2(2, 76) = 3.56, p < .05. Main
effects for visual field were also reliable both by subjects,
F1(1, 32) = 5.61, p < .05, and by items, F2(1, 38) = 19.96, p < .001.
Idiomaticity reached significance by subjects only, F1(1, 32) = 5.28,
p < .05. Language interacted with idiomaticity, but only in the analysis by subjects, F1(1, 32) = 4.63, p < .05. Context interacted with
idiomaticity by subjects, F1(2, 64) = 6.73, p < .005, and by items,
F2(2, 76) = 5.35, p < .01). Interaction between language, context,
visual field and idiomaticity was significant by subjects only,
F1(2, 64) = 4.24, p < .05. The 22 ms advantage found for targets
presented to the right visual field is in keeping with previous findings reported for lexical decisions to words presented laterally and
is attributed to the left hemisphere superiority in processing
linguistic stimuli. It also suggests that the hemifield presentation
employed in the experiment succeeded in shifting the balance of
processing to either the right or left hemisphere. Separate 3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Visual Field:
Right vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) ANOVAs were next performed for the Polish and English RTs in order to
see how priming effects obtained for figurative and literal targets
varied for L1 and L2 idioms. The results are reported separately for
each language.
3.1.1. Visual field asymmetries in L1
A three-way ANOVA for the Polish condition revealed a main
effect of context, both by subjects, F1(2, 64) = 5.65, p < .01, and by

141

items, F2(2, 34) = 7.38, p < 0.005. There was also a main effect of
visual field in the item analysis, F2(1, 35) = 5.05, p < 0.05). The
two-way interaction between context and idiomaticity reached
significance by subjects, F1(2, 64) = 3.98, p = .05), but not by items,
F2 < 1. Given the significance of visual field in the higher-order
analysis, separate 3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) ANOVAs were
next run for the rvf/LH and lvf/RH. Beginning with the data for
the rvf/LH, a marginally significant main effect was found for context by items, F2(1, 33) = 3.02, p = 0.06, and a significant two-way
interaction between context and idiomaticity in the subject analysis, F1(2, 64) = 3.27, p < .05. In turn, results for the lvf/RH showed a
main effect for context but only in the subject analysis, F1(2, 64) =
3.87, p < .05. The means for RTs obtained for both visual fields in
the Polish condition are summarized in the top panel of Table 2
(see also Fig. 1). As can be seen from the Table, the lvf/RH showed
a comparable significant facilitation for literal targets following
both ambiguous (46 ms, t(37) = 1.83, p < 0.05) and unambiguous
context (41 ms, t(37) = 2.52, p < 0.05). On the other hand, the
activation of figurative meanings in the RH was clearly influenced
by context, with no facilitation found for figurative targets following ambiguous context and significant priming for those targets
(35 ms, t(37) = 2.27, p < 0.05), when they followed idioms
embedded in unambiguous context. The data for the rvf/LH reveal
robust activation of literal meanings, but only in ambiguous
context (the priming effect of 56 ms, t(37) = 3.38, p < 0.01). No
activation was evident for literal targets where they were contextually inappropriate. Figurative salient meanings of L1 idioms, predicted to be primarily activated in the rvf/LH, failed to be facilitated
in either context in the LH, whereas they were significantly primed
when presented in the lvf/RH following unambiguous context.
3.1.2. Visual field asymmetries in L2
In a 3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control) 
2(Visual Field: Right vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative
vs. Literal) ANOVA, a main effect was found for context, F1(2, 64) =
4.65, p < .05, visual field, F1(1, 32) = 3.57, p < .05, and idiomaticity,
F1(1, 32) = 10.85, p < .005, in the subject analysis and for context,
F2(2, 34) = 7.38, p < 0.005, and visual field, F2(1, 35) = 5.05, p < 0.05,
in the item analysis. Given the significance of visual field, a context
by idiomaticity analyses were next run for the rvf/LH and lvf/RH.
Results are summarized in Table 2 (top panel; see also Fig. 1). Analysis for the rvf/LH revealed a main effect for idiomaticity by subjects,
F1(1, 32) = 8.23, p < .01 and main effect of context by items,
F1(2, 36) = 3.91, p < 0.05. In addition, a marginally significant interaction between context and idiomaticity was found by subjects,
F1(2, 64) = 2.74, p = 0.07, and a significant context by idiomaticity
interaction in the item analysis, F2(2, 36) = 3.19, p = 0.05. This interaction shows that there was a significant difference in the activation
of literal targets in the LH as a function of context, with literal meanings robustly activated in ambiguous context (the priming effect of
71 ms, t(37) = 4.67, p < 0.001) and suppressed when they were
contextually incompatible. For the lvf/RH, the only main effect was
that of context by subjects, F1(2, 64) = 3.99, p < .05, and by items,
F1(2, 36) = 5.78, p < 0.01. Irrespective of contextual bias, literal
meanings of English idioms displayed to the RH became comparably
significantly facilitated in both ambiguous (the priming effect of
38 ms, t(37) = 2.28, p < 0.05) and unambiguous (the priming effect
of 42 ms, t(37) = 3.01, p < 0.01) contexts.
3.2. Experiment 2 - 300 ms ISI
Only correct responses were entered into the statistical analysis
(95% of all the data). Similar to Experiment 1, errors were equally
distributed across conditions (5.5% errors on figurative targets,
4.4% errors on literal targets, 5.3% errors on nonwords in the Polish

condition; 5.2% errors on figurative targets, 5.2% errors on literal
targets, 4.6% errors on nonwords in the English condition), no significant effects or trends were found in the analysis on error rates,
and correlations between RTs and errors revealed no speed-accuracy tradeoffs. RTs with two SDs above or below the mean were removed from further analysis (0.5% in the Polish and 0.9% in the
English data). Two participants failed to reach the required threshold of 75% correct responses and one person pressed the wrong
button in the English condition, so those data were excluded as
well.
The overall ANOVA showed a significant main effect of context
by subjects, F1(2, 61) = 6.64, p < 0.005, and marginally significant
by items, F2(2, 68) = 2.813, p = 0.06. Further analysis by subjects revealed a main effect for visual field, F1(1, 61) = 5.48, p < 0.05. The
only significant two-way interaction was that between language
and idiomaticity in the subject analysis, F1(1, 61) = 7.04, p < 0.05.
None of the three-way interactions were significant. The fourway interaction between language, context, visual field, and idiomaticity was marginally significant in the subject analysis,
F1(2, 68) = 2.58, p = 0.10. Similar to the results from Experiment
1, the 22 ms advantage was found for targets presented to the right
visual field, confirming previous findings suggesting the left hemisphere superiority in processing linguistic stimuli. To further
examine priming effects for L1 and L2 idioms, separate 3(Context:
Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Visual Field: Right
vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) ANOVAs
were conducted for the Polish and English language conditions.
Since no significant effects were found in the 3-way analysis in
the Polish condition, no further lower-order analyses were conducted. As can be seen from Table 2 (middle panel, see also

Fig. 2), no statistically significant cerebral asymmetries were found
in the Polish data.

3.2.1. Visual field asymmetries in L2
In the English condition, there was a main effect for context by
subjects, F1(2, 56) = 9.38, p < 0.001, and by items, F2(2, 36) = 3.72,
p < 0.05. Analyses of visual field, F1(1, 28) = 4.59, p < 0.05, and idiomaticity, F1(1, 28) = 10.53, p < 0.005 were significant by subjects.
Since the visual field turned out to be significant, separate 3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) ANOVAs were performed for the rvf/LH
and lvf/RH. For the rvf/LH, the main effects for context,
F1(2, 64) = 3.86, p < 0.05, and target, F1(1, 32) = 5.40, p < 0.05, were
significant but only by subjects, whereas for the lvf/RH, a marginally significant effect was found for context by subjects,
F1(2, 62) = 2.56, p = 0.08, but significant by items, F2(2, 36) = 4.44,
p < 0.05. Table 2 (middle panel) and Fig. 2 summarize the priming
patterns obtained in the English condition as a function of the visual field. No facilitation was found for literal targets displayed
in the lvf/RH. On the other hand, figurative targets were primed
only marginally in the ambiguous context (37 ms, t(37) = 1.92,
p = 0.06), and significantly in the unambiguous context (41 ms,
t(37) = 2.04, p < 0.05), suggesting the RH sensitivity to contextual
constraints. In turn, the LH appeared at this stage unaffected by
context, with priming patterns obtained for the rvf/LH being highly
comparable for both literal and figurative targets following both
ambiguous and unambiguous sentences. Whereas no significant
facilitation was obtained in either context for figurative targets, literal meanings were primed robustly, in both ambiguous (60 ms,

3.3. Experiment 3 - 800 ms ISI
As reported for the previous two Experiments, the distribution
of errors in Experiment 3 was equal (4.4% errors on figurative targets, 5% errors on literal targets, 3.6% errors on nonwords in the
Polish condition; 3% errors on figurative targets, 3% errors on literal
targets, 2.9% errors on nonwords in the English condition), and no
speed-accuracy tradeoff was found. RTs with two SDs above or below the mean were excluded from the analysis. This criterion further eliminated 1.3% of the data in the Polish and 1.1% of the data
in the English condition. Three participants failed to reach the required threshold of 75% correct responses, so their data were removed as well. A 2(Language: Polish vs. English)  3(Context:
Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Visual Field: Right
vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) revealed
the following significant interactions: language interacted with
idiomaticity, F1(1, 67) = 11.15, p < 0.005, context vs. idiomaticity
in the analysis by subjects, F1(2, 134) = 4.23, p < 0.05, and by items,
F2(2, 72) = 3.10, p = 0.05, and visual field vs. idiomaticity in the
analysis by subjects, F1(1, 67) = 4.75, p < 0.05, and by items,
F2(1, 73) = 7.94, p < 0.05. In the analysis by items, the main effect
of visual field was marginally significant, F2(1, 73) = 3.23, p = 0.07.
Interaction between language, context, visual field, and idiomaticity was not significant in the analysis by items, but since it approached significance in the analysis by subjects, F1(2, 72) = 1.74,
p = 0.163, we explored it further with lower-level analyses. The
sections below report on visual field asymmetries in each language
condition.

3.3.1. Visual field asymmetries in L1
A 3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control) 
2(Visual Field: Right vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative
vs. Literal) ANOVA run on the Polish data revealed a marginal main
effect for idiomaticity by subjects, F1(1, 33) = 3.28, p = 0.07, and a
main effect for visual field by items, F2(1, 36) = 4.96, p < 0.05. In
addition, a marginally significant two-way interaction between visual field and idiomaticity was found in the item analysis,
F2(1, 36) = 3.50, p = 0.07. To further inspect visual field processing
differences, separate 3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs.
Control)  2 (Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) ANOVAs
were performed for each visual field. Idiomaticity turned out significant in the analysis by subjects, F1(1, 36) = 4.39, p < 0.05, but
only for the rvf/LH condition. Results are summarized in the bottom panel of Table 2 (see also Fig. 3). Neither literal nor figurative
meanings were facilitated in the lvf/RH, while only literal meanings were reliably facilitated in the rvf/LH following ambiguous
context, (the priming effect of 42 ms, t(37) = 2.38, p < 0.05), and
marginally following unambiguous context, (the priming effect of
35 ms, t(37) = 1.73, p = 0.09.
3.3.2. Visual field asymmetries in L2
A 3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Visual Field: Right vs. Left)  2(Target Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) ANOVA for the English data showed a main effect for
idiomaticity, F1(1, 34) = 8.89, p < 0.01, a significant interaction of
visual field and idiomaticity by items, F2(1, 37) = 4.64, p < 0.05,
but marginal by subjects, F1(1, 34) = 3.55, p = 0.06, and a significant
interaction between context and idiomaticity both by subjects,
F1(2, 68) = 3.56, p < 0.05, and by items, F2(2, 36) = 3.47, p < 0.05. Given the significant interaction found for visual field, separate

and in the English (L2) condition (bottom panel) at 300 ms ISI.

3(Context: Ambiguous vs. Unambiguous vs. Control)  2(Target
Idiomaticity: Figurative vs. Literal) ANOVAs were next run for the
rvf/LH and lvf/RH (see summary of the results in the bottom panel
of Table 2 and Fig. 3). For the rvf/LH, a marginally significant interaction between context and idiomaticity was found by subjects,
F1(2, 70) = 2.64, p = 0.07, but significant by items, F2(2, 36) = 3.45,
p < 0.05. For the lvf/RH condition, the main effect of idiomaticity
was significant by subjects, F1(1, 35) = 11.25, p < 0.005, and the effect of context was marginally significant by items, F2(2, 36) = 2.65,
p = 0.08.
As can be seen from the RTs summarized in Table 2, the data for
the English condition show prevalence of literal over figurative
activation, in that in the lvf/RH, only literal targets were primed,
comparably in both ambiguous, (33 ms, t(37) = 2.29, p < 0.05)
and unambiguous context (33 ms, t(37) = 1.61, p = 0.1). A similar
pattern was observed in the rvf/LH, where literal targets were significantly primed, both following ambiguous, (56 ms, t(37) =
2.84, p < 0.01), and unambiguous sentences, (38 ms, t(37) =
2.69, p < 0.05). Unlike literal targets, figurative targets failed to
be significantly activated in either context.

4. Discussion
By manipulating the type of context (unambiguous/constraining vs. ambiguous/unconstraining), the visual field (lvf/RH vs. rvf/
LH) and the length of the interstimulus interval (0 ms, 300 ms,
and 800 ms), the study described in this paper attempted to shed
more light on the time-course of idiom processing in the two cerebral hemispheres of native and nonnative language users, as well
as to test combined predictions of the Graded Salience Hypothesis

and Fine/Coarse Coding Theory with regard to the role of salience
and context in resolving lexical ambiguity inherent in idiomatic
expressions. Overall, our data provide partial support for the joined
predictions of the GSH/FCT, and they additionally point to the role
of language status (native vs. nonnative) in determining the pattern of hemispheric asymmetries. We discuss our findings in terms
of the role of salience, context, and then language.
4.1. Salience in L1 and L2 idiom processing
Contrary to our predictions that salient figurative meanings of
L1 idioms would become available faster in the LH than in the
RH, the opposite was found to be true, with figurative targets
primed solely in the lvf/RH at 0 ms ISI. Facilitation for L1 figurative
meanings as early as at idiom offset implies that those meanings
are indeed strongly coded in the mental lexicon and become automatically activated upon encounter of the idiomatic phrase, especially when presented in unambiguous context (see for example,
Cacciari & Tabossi, 1988; Colombo, 1993; Tabossi & Zardon,
1993; Titone & Connine, 1994). At later time windows, no significant priming was found for L1 literal or figurative meanings at
300 ms ISI. Lack of significant priming in either visual field at a
moderate ISI is consistent with previous findings reported in hemifield studies (e.g., Coney & Evans, 2000; Mashal et al., 2008). Similarly, comparable RTs found for targets displayed in the rvf/LH
after both ambiguous and unambiguous contexts are compatible
with the results reported earlier (e.g., Kacinik & Chiarello, 2007).
At 800 ms ISI a significant facilitation was obtained for L1 literal
meanings, but only in the rvf/LH, a finding inconsistent with the
GSH/FCT. Maintenance of nonsalient meanings in the LH, but not
the RH, at longer time windows, might reflect a differential re-

sponse of both hemispheres to the disambiguation of idiomatic
expressions, in line with the conclusion by Stowe et al. (2003).
Based on their hemifield priming study with ambiguous idioms
embedded in literal-bias context, Stowe et al. suggest that the need
to suppress the contextually inappropriate meaning of an idiom
poses a considerable challenge to the LH. Increased priming for
contextually irrelevant, literal meanings found in our data might
hence be a function of the LH active engagement in suppressing
those meanings, as also demonstrated in neuroimagining studies
which showed a crucial role of the left inferior frontal cortex in
idiom comprehension (e.g., Hillert and Buracas, 2009; Fogliata
et al., 2007; Oliveri et al., 2004). Indeed, Fogliata et al. (2007) suggest that the involvement of the left prefrontal cortex in idiom processing might reflect not only retrieval of the figurative meaning of
an idiom from semantic memory, but also inhibition of its alternative competing literal meaning.
Lack of significant priming for figurative meanings of L1 idioms
in the LH and robust facilitation of literal meanings in both visual
fields might also be explained with reference to automatic vs. controlled processing (e.g., Anaki et al., 1998). Anaki et al. have suggested that under short time delays where automatic processing
prevails, both hemispheres reveal equivalent priming when
prime-target pairs are associates sharing a high degree of semantic
feature overlap (e.g., CAT-DOG). On the other hand, with non-associated stimuli (e.g., KING-DUKE), requiring the engagement of controlled processing, priming effects are likely to be obtained only in
the RH (see also Abernethy & Coney, 1996; Chiarello et al., 2003).
Employing word targets related literally and figuratively to idioms
in a priming paradigm unavoidably leads to the occurrence of a
larger number of semantically overlapping associates in the lit-

eral-related set than in the figurative-related set (see also Colombo, 1993). To provide an example from our stimulus materials, a
literal target paired with the idiom be in the saddle was HORSE,
while the figurative target was POWER, with the former clearly
bearing a closer associative relationship to the last word of the
idiom than the latter. Given the prevalence of paired prime-target
associates in the literal set, it comes as no surprise that both hemispheres obtained significant priming for literal targets at idiom offset, and that only the RH facilitated the processing of figurative
targets which were mostly non-associatively related to the preceding idioms. Such a predominantly word-level type of association in
the literal set and a predominantly phrase-level type of association
in the figurative set is inherent in all idiom priming paradigms and
stems from the fact that it is impossible to provide a one-word
summary of the literal meaning of the whole phrase (see Titone
& Connine, 1999). For this reason, facilitation found for literal targets cannot be taken to imply that a sentence-level literal interpretation of an idiom is constructed in the course of its processing, but
merely that literal meanings of idiom constituent words get activated (see Colombo, 1993). Because of the suggested differential
sensitivity of both hemispheres to word- vs. sentence-level relations, this literal vs. figurative target difference needs to be taken
into account, especially when interpreting results from visual half
field studies which explore the processing of whole ambiguous
phrases. Unlike studying lexical ambiguities present in single
words, such as homonyms, where stimulus targets relating to
dominant and subordinate meanings both rely on word-level associations (cf. Anaki et al.'s 1998 study), looking at ambiguous idioms
necessarily calls for the recruitment of varying stimuli which
instantiate two different types (word-level vs. phrase-level) of

146

computation. Hemispheric asymmetries demonstrated in such
studies might therefore vary not only according to the effects of
context or salience, but also according to processing-based demands of the task (see Vaid & Park, 1997; Yang, Edens, Simpson,
& Krawczyk, 2009 for task effects in laterality studies). However,
recent cerebral asymmetry research has seriously challenged the
view postulating predominantly sentence-level processing mechanism for the LH and predominantly word-level processing mechanism for the RH, suggesting that both hemispheres use messagelevel information, but they do so in qualitatively different ways
(Coulson et al., 2005; Federmeier & Kutas, 1999; Wlotko &
Federmeier, 2007). Federmeier and Kutas (1999) have suggested
that the left hemisphere processing is predictive, in that it generates expectancies concerning the features of the upcoming item
most predicted by the preceding context. On the other hand, the
right hemisphere processing is integrative, in that it involves comparison of the features of the target word with those of previously
encountered words and the message level. Such an integrative
strategy calls for maintenance of the extracted information over
some time and explains facilitation for a broader range of semantic
associates.
In light of the possible discrepancy between word- vs. phraselevel type of association characterizing literal vs. figurative targets,
the pattern of the current data obtained for L1 idiom processing fits
the semantic profiles of both hemispheres sketched in the FCT.
More specifically, since literal targets were close semantic associates, they were more likely to be faster and more substantially activated in the LH, with its narrow focus on close semantic relations.
On the other hand, figurative associates had much less semantic
overlap with preceding stimulus phrases and hence required the
activation of broader and more distantly related (metaphorical)
meanings. Such distant semantic relationships primarily rely on
coarse semantic coding for their activation and are therefore
primed more significantly in the RH. However, the results might
also be interpreted in line with the expectancy/integration account
(Federmeier & Kutas, 1999). Under this view, the LH anticipates
features of the item most predicted in the evolving context and
facilitates their recognition even if they do not fit the sentence
message level. LH facilitation found in our study for literal associates to idioms used figuratively fits the expectancy profile of the
LH. On the other hand, integrative processing in the RH compares
features of the target word directly with those of the items previously encountered in the context and is driven by message-level
contextual congruency. In line with this account, facilitation for
figurative targets which were congruent with the idiomatic meanings and which called for integrative type of processing was found
in the RH, but not in the LH.
Given the special salience of literal meanings in the course of L2
idiom processing, we expected the patterns of literal and figurative
meaning facilitation in the English condition to diverge from those
obtained in the Polish data. In line with our predictions, priming
for literal meanings of L2 idioms significantly exceeded figurative
meaning facilitation. Literal targets showed robust priming
throughout all time delays in both hemispheres, except at
300 ms ISI, where they were facilitated only in the rvf/LH. This
prevalence of literal facilitation for L2 idiom processing in all three
ISI conditions further strengthens the notion of the special status
that literal meanings of L2 idioms enjoy in the course of their processing by nonnative language users. If literal meanings of L2 idioms are indeed higher in salience than figurative meanings, then
the data obtained in the English condition can be viewed as compatible with the GSH/FCT, in that more priming was found for nonsalient L2 figurative meanings in the lvf/RH than in the rvf/LH and
more priming for salient L2 literal meanings in the rvf/LH than in
the lvf/RH. Figurative meanings of L2 idioms became available only
after 300 ms. Lack of figurative priming immediately at idiom off-

set and availability of idioms' figurative meanings at later time
windows have been also previously reported in monolingual idiom
processing studies (e.g., Cacciari & Tabossi, 1988; Caillies & Butcher, 2007).
Furthermore, the data obtained for the English condition are
consistent with Fogliata et al.'s (2007) suggestion concerning increased activation in the LH during the suppression of literal meanings of idiomatic phrases. Since for L2 speakers, literal meanings of
idioms are much more salient and readily activated, considerably
more inhibitory control is called for in the course of their suppression and retrieval of the idioms' figurative meaning. Robust facilitation for L2 literal meanings found in the rvf/LH in Experiments 1,
2, and 3 could thus be viewed as reflecting increased effort of the
LH to suppress the competing alternatives. These results are also
compatible with studies from clinical populations showing impaired processing of ambiguous idioms related to lesions or dysfunctions of the prefrontal cortex and subsequent impairment of
central executive skills (see, for example, Iakimova, Passerieux, &
Hardy-Bayle, 2006; Papagno et al., 2003, 2006; Schettino et al.,
2010; Titone, Holzman, & Levy, 2002). Dysexecutive deficits in
such patients seriously undermine their ability to comprehend idiomatic expressions, especially ambiguous ones, which call for the
suppression of the plausible literal meaning. Since processing a figurative meaning of an L2 idiom is much more demanding on the
bilingual's central executive system than comprehending strongly
coded L1 idioms, the central executive takes more time to resolve
the conflict between the figurative and literal alternatives, rather
than breaking down completely, as is the case with aphasic, schizophrenic, or Alzheimer's patients.
More importantly, these findings are also consistent with neuroimaging studies into the neural basis of language control in bilinguals which have demonstrated greater engagement of the left
prefrontal cortex when processing a second language (see Abutalebi, 2008; Indefrey, 2006 for a comprehensive review). Increased
activity within the left prefrontal cortex has been attributed to
compensatory mechanisms called for when processing a less proficient language or greater neuronal engagement necessary to perform an L2 task (Indefrey, 2006). Another explanation (see
Abutalebi, 2008) relates increased prefrontal activity to executive
control over short- or long-term memory representations, with
more cognitive control called for when processing a weaker and
less automatic L2 system. Clearly for the bilinguals participating
in our study, processing less well automatized L2 idioms required
much more cognitive control than retrieving their strongly coded
L1 meanings.
4.2. Context in cerebral asymmetries
In relation to differential sensitivity of both hemispheres to context, the present results do not provide support for view that the
RH is less sensitive to contextual constraints than the LH. While
at 0 ms ISI the RH appeared indeed less sensitive to context than
the LH, at longer time windows hemispheric asymmetries in contextual sensitivity disappeared. In addition, the RH showed priming advantages over the LH for contextually compatible figurative
meanings of L1 idioms (at 0 ms ISI) and of L2 idioms (at 300 ms
ISI). This facilitation for contextually relevant meanings found in
the RH is consistent with the recent reports in the hemifield literature (e.g., Chiarello et al., 2001; Coney & Evans, 2000; Coulson &
Van Petten, 2007; Coulson et al., 2005; Federmeier & Kutas,
1999) and provides support for the predictive/integrative account
of meaning processing in both hemispheres (Federmeier & Kutas,
1999). Our results showing RH sensitivity to contextual bias and
LH activation of contextually incompatible meanings are similar
to those reported by Kacinik and Chiarello (2007), who found increased priming in the RH for targets following unambiguous, rel-

A.B. Cieslicka, R.R. Heredia / Brain & Language 116 (2011) 136-150

ative to those following ambiguous sentences and literal and metaphorical priming for the rvf/LH, irrespective of contextual bias.
Kacinik and Chiarello claimed that context, rather than salience
may be more essential in determining cerebral asymmetries in literal vs. figurative meaning activation in sentences.
Rather than postulating priority of context over salience, we
suggest a joined effect of salience, context, and language status
on cerebral asymmetries in processing figurative language. More
specifically, while a primarily contextually-driven priming pattern
was found in our L1 data at 0 ms ISI, after 800 ms, context failed to
exert any effect on L1 idiom processing. Interaction of context and
salience is also transparent in the English data. While the RH activation was guided primarily by salience of the linguistic material at
0 ms ISI, after 300 ms the activation became primarily contextdetermined, and at 800 ms primarily responsive to salience effects.
In turn, LH activation was guided by context at 0 ms and by salience at 300 and 800 ms. The interaction of both context and salience in determining patterns of hemispheric priming has been
shown in other dvf studies (e.g., Coney & Evans, 2000; Titone,
1998). Similar to Coney and Evans' results, where salient homograph-related targets were significantly facilitated only within
the dominant-biasing contexts, the study reported here showed
priming for salient L1 figurative targets only in the figurative
(and hence dominant-meaning) biasing context. Coney and Evans's
study further showed that levels of facilitation changed very little
over time, as if the effect of context on salient meaning was a rapid
process, complete already within the first 40 ms. Consistent with
those findings, the priming patterns found for salient L1 meanings
in the current study were present already immediately at idiom
offset, with no differences between visual fields and no priming
for salient idiomatic meanings at later time windows.
Overall, the current results speak to the role of context in lexical
ambiguity resolution and can thus be interpreted in light of the
psycholinguistic models that have been proposed to address contextual effects in language processing. At first glance, immediate
availability of both figurative and literal meanings at idiom offset
in the Polish condition might suggest support for exhaustive access
models (cf. Forster, 1979; Holmes, 1979; Onifer & Swinney, 1981;
Rayner, Carlson, & Frazier, 1983; Seidenberg, 1985; Swinney,
1979). However, facilitation obtained for literal and figurative
meanings of L1 idioms was modulated by contextual constraints
and by the visual field, so the results reported here are in fact more
compatible with the reordered access model (Rayner and Duffy,
1986), which assumes that both context and meaning dominance
(salience) converge to make the biased meaning available earlier.
Exclusively literal facilitation found for L2 idioms at 0 ms ISI and
delayed emergence of figurative activation for those idioms are
also consistent with predictions of the reordered access model.
Specifically, while at 0 ms ISI, figurative-biasing context could
not override salience effects and so only the more salient, literal
meanings of L2 idioms became significantly activated, after
300 ms context came to affect lexical access by boosting retrieval
of less salient, but contextually appropriate, figurative meanings.
4.3. Language as a modulating factor in hemispheric activation
In addition to context and salience, language (L1 vs. L2) emerges
as a crucial determinant of patterns of cerebral asymmetries in figurative language processing. More specifically, at 0 ms ISI, comparable patterns of activation were found for the LH in both the L1
and L2 data, but not for the RH, where only figurative facilitation
was obtained in the L1 condition and only literal facilitation in
the L2 condition. Bilateral priming for literal and/or figurative
idiom meanings demonstrated at idiom offset is consistent with
studies showing bilateral activation in the prefrontal cortex in
the course of idiom processing (see Rizzo et al., 2007; Romero Lau-

147

ro et al., 2008; Zempleni et al., 2007). The role of language as a
modulating factor in cerebral asymmetries also transpires in the
data obtained in Experiment 2 (300 ms ISI). While the L1 condition
showed no reliable differences and no facilitation for either literal
or figurative meanings, in either lvf/RH or rvf/LH, both hemispheres were activated in the L2 condition. This bilateral activation
for English was maintained at 800 ms ISI and was much more substantial than in the Polish condition, where only the LH showed
significant priming. Increased activation of the RH over longer time
windows for L2, but not for L1 idiom processing, might be reflective of the greater cognitive load related to interpreting figurative
meanings of L2 expressions which are less well coded in the mental lexicon. As suggested by the cognitive resources hypothesis
(Monetta, Ouellet-Plamondon, & Joanete, 2006), the contribution
of the RH to figurative language processing lies not so much in
its unique ability to process metaphorical meanings, but rather in
providing complementary attentional resources required to perform a complex and demanding task (see also, Rapp et al., 2004;
Schmidt & Seger, 2009; Yang et al., 2009). In addition and even
more directly relevant for our study, which employed ambiguous
idiomatic phrases, increased activation in the RH was previously
found to be related to processing ambiguous, as opposed to unambiguous idioms (see Zempleni et al., 2007). Overall, the data reported here for L1 and L2 idioms are consistent with the claim
that cooperation of both hemispheres is crucial for successful processing of figurative language (Baum & Titone, 2005; Cacciari et al.,
2006; Gagnon, Goulet, Giroux, & Joanete, 2003; Huber-Okrainec
et al., 2005; Papagno et al., 2006; Paul et al., 2003; Rizzo et al.,
2007).
When discussing the influence of language status on patterns of
figurative and literal meaning activation in both hemispheres, the
functional neuroanatomy of L1 vs. L2 needs to be considered as another important factor. In general, studies into the cerebral basis of
bilingualism seem to converge on the idea that a number of variables determine language representations in the bilingual brain.
Among them, age of L2 acquisition, level of L2 proficiency, and language exposure emerge as the most critical ones (Abutalebi, Cappa,
& Perani, 2001; Abutalebi, Cappa, & Perani, 2005; Abutalebi &
Green, 2007; Hull & Vaid, 2005, 2006, 2007; Indefrey, 2006;
Moreno, Rodriguez-Fornells, & Laine, 2008; Perani & Abutalebi,
2005; Perani et al., 1996; Perani et al., 1998; Perani et al., 2003;
Stowe & Sabourn, 2005; Vaid & Hall, 1991; Vaid & Hull, 2002).
More recently, based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of bilingual laterality studies, Hull and Vaid (2007) have concluded that
functional lateralization is mainly affected by age of onset of bilingualism (see also Abutalebi, 2008), with early bilinguals showing
bilateral hemispheric activity for both languages and late ones
showing LH dominance for both their native and second language
(see also Hull & Vaid, 2006). Bilinguals participating in the studies
reported here were all highly-proficient Polish-English speakers
who started learning English at school. In addition, for all the participants, their dominant language was Polish and their pattern of
environmental exposure to L2 was also largely homogenous, with
English being learned through formal instruction and practiced
mostly in an academic setting. Indeed, the present data seem to
support the late bilingual laterality profile identified in Hull and
Vaid's meta-analysis, in that overall more activation was obtained
for stimulus targets displayed in the LH than in the RH, for both L1
and L2. While the LH remained active throughout all time windows
for both languages, the RH showed activation for L1 only at 0 ms ISI
and for L2 also at 300 and 800 ms. Increased and more extensive
brain activation when processing L2 relative to L1 has been taken
to imply that the second language is more effortful to process than
the native language and might therefore draw on additional resources; hence resulting in quantitative differences in the use of
essentially convergent neural substrates for both languages (see,

148

e.g., Briellmann et al., 2004; Stowe & Sabourn, 2005; see also
Abutalebi, 2008; Green & Abutalebi, 2008 for reviews of studies
suggesting a single adapted network underlying the representation
of both L1 and L2).
5. Conclusions
All in all, as demonstrated in the hemifield experiments reported here, the dynamics of literal and figurative meaning activation evolving over time in both hemispheres suggest a complex
pattern, with language, context and salience jointly modulating
cerebral asymmetries. By exploring literal vs. figurative activation
of idiom meanings in the course of their on-line processing, the
experiments reported here are informative on the issue of idiom
storage and processing. Substantial activation found for literal
meanings of idiom constituent words in the current study provides
support for those psycholinguistic models of idioms which suggest
similar mechanisms for processing literal and figurative language
and postulate that individual meanings of idioms' components
play a significant role in idiom processing, such as the Configuration
Hypothesis (Cacciari & Tabossi, 1988), the Hybrid Model (Titone &
Connine, 1999), or the Superlemma Theory (Sprenger, Levelt, &
Kempen, 2006; see also Smolka, Rabanus, & Rosler, 2007).
In conclusion, there appear to be a number of factors affecting
hemispheric asymmetries in processing L1 and L2 figurative language and these factors interact in complex ways to determine
how literal and figurative meanings are activated throughout the
course of idiom comprehension. The present paper discussed the
role of context, salience, and language, but presumably many other
factors are responsible for the cerebral differences in figurative
processing. One of them might relate to idiom characteristics, such
as their compositionality (see Titone, 1998) or ambiguity (Zempleni et al., 2007). Cerebral asymmetry in figurative processing certainly merits further investigation to adequately capture the
unfolding patterns of literal and figurative activation and the interplay of context, salience, language, and possibly other factors in the
course of idiom comprehension.
