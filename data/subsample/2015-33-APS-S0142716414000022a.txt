ABSTRACT
The study explored the contribution of two aspects of inflectional morphological awareness, verb
inflection and noun-adjective inflection, to word reading and reading comprehension in the Greek
language, which is an orthographically transparent language. Participants (120 first graders, 123
second graders, 126 third graders) were given two oral language experimental tasks of inflectional
morphological awareness. Furthermore, phonological awareness, receptive vocabulary, expressive
vocabulary, decoding, and reading comprehension were evaluated. It was revealed that noun-adjective
inflectional morphology contributed significantly to decoding only in first grade, while verb inflectional
morphology had a significant contribution to reading comprehension in third grade. It is interesting that
inflectional morphological awareness did not predict reading skills for second graders. Phonological
awareness was a firm predictor of word reading in all grades and made a unique contribution in Grades
2 and 3. Finally, in all grades, receptive vocabulary was a steady predictor of reading comprehension,
whereas expressive vocabulary predicted only first-grade reading comprehension. It is suggested that
inflectional morphological awareness may be an important predictor of early reading in a language
with a shallow orthography and a rich morphology.

Research studies to date in the field of reading development have underlined the
multicomponential nature of reading, with word reading and reading comprehension being two distinct aspects of developing literacy. Furthermore, multiple
oral language and print-related skills are considered to play a crucial role in
literacy development. Existing literature has supported three oral language skills,
namely, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and morphological awareness, being
involved in reading development (Kuo & Anderson, 2006; Protopapas, Sideridis,
Mouzaki, & Simos, 2007; Ricketts, Nation, & Bishop, 2007; Ziegler & Goswami,
2005).
Several studies in shallow and deep orthographies have repeatedly demonstrated
the importance of phonological awareness for reading development (e.g., de Jong

& van der Leij, 2002; Manis, Doi, & Bhadha, 2000). Phonological processing
skills appear to have a universal role in reading development across the alphabetic
languages (Caravolas, Lervag, Defior, Malkova, & Hulme, 2013), although their
contribution to prediction of reading in transparent orthographies may be significant mostly during the first 2 years of reading instruction (Georgiou, Torppa,
Manolitsis, Lyytinen, & Parrila, 2012). There is also evidence that phonological awareness contributes to early word reading that is independent from other
language and cognitive skills, namely, verbal and nonverbal IQ, memory, and
morphological and orthographic processing skills (Deacon, 2011).
Oral vocabulary skills also play a significant role in the distinct reading skills of
decoding, visual word recognition, and reading comprehension (Ouellette, 2006).
It is suggested that both vocabulary size and quality of semantic representations are
associated in a unique way with word reading accuracy and reading comprehension. Correlational and longitudinal studies have supported the influence of oral
vocabulary on decoding and reading comprehension throughout the elementary
school period (e.g., Verhoeven & van Leeuwe, 2008; Verhoeven, van Leeuwe, &
Vermeer, 2011). According to the simple view of reading (Hoover & Gough, 1990),
reading comprehension, the ultimate goal of the reading process, is the product of
the interaction of two components: decoding and listening comprehension. These
two components have an independent significant contribution to reading comprehension, in both deep and shallow orthographic systems (Megherbi, Seigneuric
& Ehrlich, 2006; Protopapas et al., 2007). Successful reading comprehension is
a result of a balanced development of these two components with the relative
contribution of each component to reading comprehension changing depending
on reading competence and age (Hoover & Gough, 1990). In particular, in the
early years of reading instruction (Grades 1-2), decoding predicts more variance
in reading comprehension than listening comprehension does. On the contrary, in
later stages of reading development, when word reading becomes more automatic,
the contribution of listening comprehension increases. However, research studies
have revealed that the relative contribution of each component to reading comprehension may also vary depending on the type of the orthographic system (Florit
& Cain, 2011; Megherbi et al., 2006). As Florit and Cain (2011) demonstrated in
an exploratory meta-analysis, in transparent alphabetic languages, listening comprehension was a more significant predictor of first- and second-grade reading
comprehension than was decoding accuracy. Vocabulary is one of the constructs
that contributes to language comprehension (Muter, Hulme, Snowling, & Stevenson, 2004), and decoding is dependent on both phonological skills and vocabulary
(Oullette, 2006).
Finally, a substantial body of research in both alphabetic and nonalphabetic
languages indicates that morphological awareness may also contribute to reading outcomes (e.g., Casalis & Luis-Alexandre, 2000; Kirby et al., 2011; Kuo &
Anderson, 2006; Roman, Kirby, Parrila, Wade-Woolley, & Deacon, 2009; Wang,
Ko, & Choi, 2009). Moreover, its contribution to reading outcomes appears to
be independent from the contribution of phonological awareness or other related
skills (e.g., Carlisle & Nomanbhoy, 1993; Deacon, 2011; Mahony, Singson, &
Mann, 2000; Roman et al., 2009). Morphological awareness is expected to have
an impact on word reading skills, because the mental lexicon is morphologically

organized (Kuo & Anderson, 2006). The contribution of morphological awareness
to decoding skills increases with age and consequently is more important in later
reading development (Casalis & Luis-Alexandre, 2000; Mahony et al, 2000).
Further, morphological awareness skills have been found to influence reading
comprehension (Casalis & Luis-Alexandre, 2000; Kuo & Anderson, 2006), and
this contribution becomes stronger with age (Kuo & Anderson, 2006). As children
age, they are exposed to more complex texts, which include an increasing number
of unknown morphologically complex words. Morphological awareness helps
these readers to analyze words into constituents and thus to infer their meaning,
which in turn makes comprehension of the texts an easier task.

INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGICAL AWARENESS AND READING

Morphological awareness is defined as the ability to "reflect on and manipulate" the
morphemic structure of words (Carlisle, 1995). Words are made up of morphemes,
the smallest units of meaning in language. Two or more morphemes are combined
to produce a new word or a different form of the same word. The Greek language
has a shallow orthography with morphophonemic structure (Porpodas, 2006). It
has a rich morphology system, including derivational morphology, inflections, as
well as compounds (Ralli, 2005). Morphemes are classified into free morphemes
and two types of bound morphemes: the stems and the affixes. An affix can be
a prefix or a suffix. The suffixes are typically more common than the prefixes.
A prefix is always placed before the stem and produces a new derived word. A
suffix is placed after the stem, and it can be a derived or an inflectional suffix.
Adding a derivational suffix to a stem is constrained by phonological, semantic,
and pragmatic factors (Ralli, 2005). According to Ralli (2005), one example of
a phonological constraint is that the derivational suffix - (-ma) is added in
disyllabic verbal stems (e.g., o- [anig-ma], opening), whereas the suffix
-o (-simo) is added in monosyllabic verbal stems (e.g., -o [li-simo],
solution/looseness). As far as semantic constraints, Ralli (2005) provided the
following example: the suffix -() (-ti[s]), which means the agent cannot be
combined with a verb of statement (like sleep), but only with verbs of agency (like
dance; e.g., o- [choref-tis], dancer). Finally, an example of a pragmatic
limitation is that the augmentative suffix cannot be added to a stem that indicates
an abstract concept (e.g., sadness). For instance, the word o- (port-ara,
the bigger door) is grammatical and results from adding the augmentative suffix
- (-ara) to the stem o- (port-; o, door). However, the word -
(lip-ara, the great sadness) is ungrammatical bcause there is not such a pragmatical
concept (Ralli, 2005). Thus, a derivational morpheme cannot be attached to all
base words, as an inflectional morpheme can be.
Inflectional morphology refers to the formation of variant forms of the same
word by adding an inflectional suffix to a stem. For example, in English, the
regular past tense in verbs is formed by adding the inflectional morpheme -ed
in the verb stem (I play-I played). Research in alphabetic languages has shown
that the acquisition of awareness of inflectional morphology begins early (Kuo
& Anderson, 2006), with children recognizing and manipulating the inflectional

morphemes by the early elementary years (Casalis & Luis-Alexandre, 2000; Kuo
& Anderson, 2006).
Inflectional morphological awareness is considered to play an important role in
reading competence (e.g., Casalis & Luis-Alexandre, 2000; Deacon, 2011), and it
contributes to distinct reading outcomes and in different age groups. Moreover, its
impact on reading skills is evident in various languages, such as English (Deacon,
2011; Deacon & Kirby, 2004), French (Casalis & Luis-Alexandre, 2000), Finnish
(Muller & Brady, 2001), and Dutch (Rispens, McBride-Chang, & Reitsma, 2008).
It is more important that these languages vary in terms of the complexity of their
inflectional system and their orthographic depth as well. Alphabetic writing systems vary in terms of grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences, and they are placed
in a continuum from transparent to opaque. The degree of consistency between
phonemes and graphemes affects word reading accuracy. In transparent languages,
such as Greek or Finnish, decoding real words and pseudowords is usually dependent on grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules, whereas in opaque languages
like English, where a grapheme can have multiple pronunciations, accurate reading
cannot be based solely on these rules (Seymour, Aro, & Erskine, 2003). Therefore,
in an opaque language, readers can benefit from the use of morphemes, because
recognizing and manipulating familiar morphemes in unfamiliar words facilitates
not only word recognition but also understanding of word meaning (Roman et al.,
2009). It is more important that inflectional morphemes may contribute to understanding of a sentence, because they mark the syntactic relations between the
words in the sentence (e.g., in English the suffix -s marks plural of nouns, and the
third person of present is always represented by the suffix -s). However, in various
alphabetic scripts, inflectional morphology varies in terms of complexity (e.g., in
Greek, the gender is marked in inflectional suffixes, whereas in English, the gender
is not marked in this way). Furthermore, in some languages, adding an inflectional
suffix may result in phonological shifts, while in other languages this does not
occur. In Greek, the plural form of a noun can be phonologically different from the
singular form (e.g., o - [to ker-I], the candle, singular;  - [ta ker-ia],
the candles, plural). Provided that languages vary in orthographic depth and in
inflectional morphology, it would be expected to find differences in the nature of
the relationship between inflections and distinct reading outcomes across various
alphabetic writing systems.
The relationship between awareness of inflections and reading was investigated by Brittain (1970), as cited in Kuo and Anderson (2006). Brittain's study
was conducted in English and documented that in Grades 1 and 2, inflectional
morphology was correlated with reading even after controlling for intelligence.
Inflectional morphology was measured in this study with a sentence-completion
task assessing the plural, the verb tense, and the possessive of pseudowords.
However, in Brittain's study, reading was defined as the combination of decoding and reading comprehension. According to Kuo and Anderson (2006), many
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in different languages have repeatedly
provided evidence for the influence of inflectional morphology on various aspects
of reading. For example, Casalis and Luis-Alexandre (2000), in a longitudinal
study with French-speaking children, from kindergarten to Grade 2, revealed a
strong relationship between inflections and reading skills. The inflectional test used

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:4
Rothou & Padeliadu: Inflectional morphological awareness in Greek

assessed the ability to add an inflectional suffix in real words and pseudowords
without the help of context. Two types of inflections were included in the task:
feminine in nouns/adjectives (e.g., un boulanger/une boulangere, a baker) and verb
tenses. The researchers found that Grade 1 decoding was explained significantly by
the kindergarten performance on the inflectional morphology task. Furthermore,
kindergarten measures of inflections predicted reading comprehension in Grade
2. It is important that in both grades none of the inflectional skills measured at
these grades explained decoding and reading comprehension, despite the reported
developmental differences in the inflectional morphology across these grades.
However, it is necessary to note that in Casalis and Luis-Alexandre's (2000) study,
the role of inflections in reading outcomes was assessed simultaneously in the
same regression model with the role of derived morphology. It is interesting that
neither inflections nor derivations assessed in first grade predicted reading skills
at this grade, while in second grade, comprehension was predicted by derived
morphology measured at the same grade. On the contrary, Kirby et al.'s (2011)
longitudinal study from Grades 1 to 3, focusing only on inflection, showed that
inflectional morphological awareness measured in Grade 3 was a more significant
predictor of Grade 3 reading ability than was morphological awareness measured
at Grades 1 and 2.
In a longitudinal study conducted in English (Grades 2-5), Deacon and Kirby
(2004) showed that verb inflection morphology (past tenses) assessed in Grade
2 was a significant predictor of reading comprehension and reading real words
and pseudowords across Grades 3 to 5, after controlling for the influence of
phonological and verbal skills. Deacon and Kirby (2004) further demonstrated
that the contribution of inflectional morphological awareness to reading outcomes
was consistent across grades, without any increase. Similarly, Deacon (2011),
in a cross-sectional study with English-speaking children in Grades 1 and 3,
found an independent and consistent contribution of morphological awareness
to word reading. Deacon (2011) assessed the independent contribution of verb
inflections, phonological awareness, and orthographic processing skills to real
word and to pseudoword reading, including a measure of receptive vocabulary.
Deacon's (2011) study showed that in both grades, the ability to change the verb
tense in a sentence analogy test had a significant independent contribution (1%-
2%) to decoding skills, which however was smaller than that of phonological
and orthographic processing skills. Interpreting these results, Deacon (2011) suggested that "It is perhaps more likely that the small size of contribution was (at
least in part) due to the relatively large number of control variables included in
the regression equation, particularly with the unique contribution of orthographic
processing" (p. 12). However, in the study conducted by Roman et al. (2009) in
English, including the same number of predictor variables, it was indicated that
morphological awareness explained almost 4% of variance in decoding. Deacon's
(2011) study explored the contribution of verb morphology in early stages of
reading development, whereas Roman et al. (2009) and Mahony et al. (2000)
studied morphology in later elementary children and they did not assess purely
inflections. Nevertheless, Deacon (2011) demonstrated that verb morphology was
an important predictor of early word reading skills in English, a language having a deep orthography and a less complex inflectional system than the Greek

language. On the contrary, related research in other languages (e.g., Casalis &
Luis-Alexandre, 2000; Muller & Brady, 2001) raised questions in regard to the
predictive role of inflections for early word reading.
Muller and Brady's (2001) study with first-grade Finnish-speaking children
also supported the contribution of inflectional morphology to early reading skills.
Compared to English, the Finnish language has a more complex inflectional system
(Kuo & Anderson, 2006) and is consistent in reading and spelling (Georgiou
et al., 2012). Their study showed that awareness of inflectional morphology was
an important predictor of reading comprehension and decoding speed, after taking
into account the effect of vocabulary. However, when phonological awareness
skills were entered into the regression equation, morphological awareness did not
predict word-reading skills. Nevertheless, it is necessary to note that in Muller and
Brady's (2001) study, the morphological awareness task did not measure purely the
verb inflections, because it also contained comparative-superlative items. Finally,
Rispens et al. (2008) demonstrated that noun inflection contributed in a unique
way to word reading in first-grade Dutch-speaking children, after controlling
for the effect of phonological processing skills. Specifically, the contribution of
noun inflection to word recognition was 4%, while the performance on the verb
inflection task (change of verb tense) was not a predictor of first-grade reading
words. The noun inflection and the verb inflection tasks consisted of pseudonouns
and pseudoverbs, respectively, whereas the noun inflection task also included
diminutive forms. The Dutch language has a transparent orthographic system like
the Greek one, and the above research provides an initial foundation for studies in
Greek.
In the Greek language, inflectional morphology is a complex and more productive process than is the derivational morphology. Inflectional suffixes are attached
to a stem, and they form different aspects of the same word. For example, in
the case of verbal inflectional morphology, the persons are marked by adding the
related suffix to the verbal stem. In the verb - (trech-o; run), the verb stem
is - (trech-). The first singular person of simple present is - (trech-o),
the second singular person is - (trech-is), and the third singular person is
- (trech-i). The inflectional word belongs to the same grammatical category
with the base word, while inflections change the grammatical function of a word
but not the grammatical category. Furthermore, adding an inflectional morpheme
does not alter the meaning of the base word. It simply adds some properties,
which however are predictable (Ralli, 2005). For example, in the verb -
(pezo; play), the verbal inflectional suffix - always represents first-person simple
present.
Nouns, adjectives, and articles are inflected for gender, number, and case. For
instance, o -o -o (o megal-os kip-os; the big garden) is a singular
nominative case, whereas the plural nominative case is o -o -o (i
megal-i kip-i; the big gardens). Verbs are marked for person and number (e.g.,
 - [ego trech-o; I run]: first singular person;  -o [emis
trech-oume; we run]: first plural person). There are four cases and three genders:
masculine, feminine, and neuter. The nominative and the accusative cases have
the same suffixes. Inflectional suffixes have semantic and syntactic properties, and
they appear to play a role in the syntax of a sentence. Further, in a sentence, the

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:4

1013

article-adjective-noun should agree in terms of tense, case, and gender. Finally,
in the case of nouns and adjectives, and in terms of cases and plural, adding an
inflectional suffix makes phonological changes to the base word, and the position
of the stress can be altered (Ralli, 2005; e.g., singular nominative: o  [to
pedi]; plural nominative:   [ta pedia]; singular nominative: o 
[to magazi]; singular genitive: o o [tou magaziou]).
In the Greek language, during the last few years, there has been an increasing
interest in the role of morphological awareness skills in early literacy, namely,
decoding and reading comprehension (Manolitsis & Kandilidou, 2011; Padeliadu,
Rothou, & Sideridis, in press; Rothou & Padeliadu, 2011). Research with Greekspeaking children has also focused on the use of morphemic rules for spelling
(Chliounaki & Bryant, 2002, 2007) as well as on the role of morphological
awareness in spelling (Tsesmeli, 2007, 2009). Rothou and Padeliadu (2011), in
a cross-sectional study with Greek-speaking children in Grades 1 to 3, investigated the unique contribution of segmentation and formation of coordinative
compounds, phonological awareness, and oral vocabulary skills to decoding and
reading comprehension. Their study revealed a significant contribution of morphological awareness to both reading skills in Grade 3 and to reading comprehension
in Grade 1. However, in Grade 2, there was not an impact of morphological skills
on reading performance. Rothou and Padeliadu (2011) study suggested that in
a transparent language, morphological awareness, namely, compounds, played a
significant role in word reading at later stages of reading development. This is in
line with results reported in a review by Kuo and Anderson (2006), with different
languages showing that the contribution of morphological awareness to wordreading skills increases with age. However, Rothou and Padeliadu found that the
morphological skills had an impact on reading comprehension in nonsequential
grades. In their study, reading comprehension in Grades 1-2 was assessed with
the same texts, but the children in second grade were better than first graders
at both decoding and vocabulary knowledge. Padeliadu, Rothou, et al. (in press)
also explored the contribution of derivational morphological awareness (diminutive nouns and derived adjectives from nouns), phonological awareness, and oral
vocabulary to the prediction of beginning reading (Grades 1 and 2). Their crosssectional data revealed that morphological awareness contributed significantly to
both decoding and reading comprehension, only in first grade, pointing again to a
nonsignificant role of morphological awareness in second-grade reading.
In sum, it appears that in alphabetic languages varying in the depth of the
orthographic system and in the richness of morphology, awareness of inflectional
morphology can be an important predictor of early reading skills. Furthermore,
given the existing research in Greek, it is revealed that in the first year of reading
instruction, derived morphology and compounds are associated with different
reading outcomes. It is also indicated that even in an orthographically transparent
language, morphological awareness, when measured as compounding, plays a
significant role only in later decoding skills, whereas derivational morphological
awareness is a significant predictor of decoding in first grade. However, both
of the above aspects of morphological awareness do not contribute to literacy
outcomes in Grade 2, when the children begin to read in a more automatic way
and develop richer vocabulary. Thus, an interesting question concerns the nature

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:4
Rothou & Padeliadu: Inflectional morphological awareness in Greek

1014

of the relationship between inflectional morphology and distinct literacy outcomes
across the first 3 years of reading instruction.
The purpose in this cross-sectional study was to investigate the role of two
aspects of inflectional morphology in word reading and reading comprehension,
in Greek language-speaking children in Grades 1, 2, and 3. At these grades,
children acquire the mechanism of reading they start to read in a more automatic
way.
Our main research question was whether and to what extent awareness of noun-
adjective inflections and awareness of verb inflections can contribute to early
reading skills. We further examined their unique contribution to word reading and
reading comprehension, after controlling for the effects of two important readingrelated skills: phonological awareness and vocabulary knowledge. Finally, we
wanted to provide some preliminary data on the development of awareness of
noun-adjective inflections and awareness of verb inflections in the Greek language.
METHOD
Participants

Participants came from 19 primary schools located in the area of Attica, which
represented urban, rural, and semiurban areas. The schools were selected randomly from a group of 68 primary schools for which we had permission from
the Pedagogic Institute and the Ministry of Education to conduct this research.
The sample consisted of 369 children: 120 in Grade 1, 123 in Grade 2, and 126
in Grade 3. The mean (standard deviations) ages in months for the children in
Grades 1 and 2 were 80.07 (3.435) and 92.16 (3.907), respectively, and 103.71
(3.173) for the children in Grade 3. The numbers of male and female participants
represent approximately half of the sample in each grade. All participants were
native speakers of Greek, and none received special educational services or had
documented reading difficulties. They were selected randomly from each class and
were included in the study, providing we had acquired a signed parental consent
form.
Testing took place from mid-January to April 2010. Each child received a battery
of four oral language tasks and two reading tasks. All tests were administered
individually to each child in a quiet room in the school and in two sessions of
approximately 30 min each, by one of the writers.
Materials
Phonological awareness. Phonological awareness was assessed with the

phoneme deletion and phoneme segmentation subtests of a standardized screening
test of reading difficulties for Grades A-B (Grades A and B refer to Grades 1 and 2,
respectively; Porpodas, 2007). In the phoneme deletion task, children were asked
to repeat a pseudoword without a specified phoneme. The task was discontinued
when children gave three consecutive incorrect answers. There were four practice items. The score was the total number of correct answers. In the phoneme

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:4

1015

segmentation task, children segmented a pseudoword in phonemes. There were
four practice items, and the total number of correct responses was the score. In
Grades 1 and 2, the task was stopped after three consecutive incorrect answers,
while in third grade, both subtests of the task were given without stopping after three consecutive incorrect responses. For all grades, a combined score for
phonological awareness was calculated by summing up the scores of the two
tasks. According to the test manual, for Grades A-B, the alpha reliability for the
phoneme deletion subtest is 0.93 and for the phoneme segmentation subtest it is
0.92. For the children in third grade, the alpha reliability was 0.82 for the phoneme
deletion and 0.96 for the phoneme segmentation. A ceiling rule for Grades 1-2, but
not 3, on the phoneme segmentation task was considered acceptable, because less
than 15% of children scored the best possible score and because alpha reliability
across all grades was adequate (>0.80).
Two aspects of inflectional morphology
were assessed: noun-adjective inflections and verb inflections. Separate oral experimental tasks were used for their measurment. Both tasks were based on the
concept of the morphological generation task (Muter et al., 2004).
The noun-adjective inflection task assessed the ability of children to produce
the plural of articles, adjectives, and nouns in the context of a sentence. The test
had 10 sentences that included the structure article-adjective-noun (AAN) in the
singular form and 4 sentences with the structure article-noun article-noun (AN
AN) in the singular form, while the remainder of each sentence was in plural. The
children were asked to produce the plural form for these structures specifically in
two cases: general and accusative.
One example for the structure AAN is the following:

Inflectional morphological awareness.

Singular form: A o       o o  o / Agorasame glika tou
mikrou pediou / We bought cakes for the small child.
Plural form: A o            / Agorasame glika ton
mikron pedion / We bought cakes for the small children.

For the structure AN AN, an example is the following:
Singular form: E  o o  o  o / Idame to filo tou pediou / We saw the
friend of the child.
Plural form: E  o o     / Idame tous filous ton pedion /
We saw the friends of the children.

The correct case was scored with 1. Therefore, the maximum correct score for
each AAN structure was 3, and for each AN AN structure the maximum correct
score was 4. The total maximum score was 46 (=[3x10] + [4x4]).
The alpha reliability for each grade was very good (Grade 1:  = 0.85, Grade
2:  = 0.90, and Grade 3:  = 0.75). Furthermore, the validity of the task was
checked with the confirmatory factor analysis using the statistical program EQS

6.1 (Bentler, 2006). The validity for each grade was proved adequate, Grade 1: 2
(74) = 109.770, p < .05, 2 /df = 1.48, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.903, root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), 90% confidence interval (CI) =
0.064 (0.036-0.087); Grade 2: 2 (74) = 91.598, p > .05, 2 /df = 1.23, CFI =
0.957, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.044 (0.000-0.071); and Grade 3: 2 (74) = 100.116,
p < .05, 2 /df = 1.35, CFI = 0.703, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.053 (0.021-0.078)
The verb inflection task used asked children to change the tense of the verb in a
sentence. A temporal adverb in the beginning of the sentence defined the alteration
of the verb tense. The children were read a pair of sentences that differed in the
temporal adverbs. The second sentence began with an adverb that reflected the
change of the verb tense. The remaining of the sentence was similar to the first
sentence. For example,
First sentence: T          / Tora esi plenis ta piata / Now you
are washing the dishes.
Second sentence (verb tense change): X  o           /
Chthes mia fora esi eplines ta piata / Yesterday (in a specific time) you washed
the dishes.

The task contained 12 verbal inflections: 3 present, 3 past, 2 perfect, and 4
future. The correct verb tense change was scored with 1. The maximum correct
score was 12.
The alpha reliability for each grade was adequate (Grade 1:  = 0.54, Grade
2:  = 0.55, and Grade 3:  = 0.69). Furthermore, the validity of the task was
checked with the confirmatory factor analysis using the statistical program EQS
6.1 (Bentler, 2006). The validity of the task was proved adequate for all grades,
Grade 1: 2 (47) = 21.258, p > .05, 2 /df = 0.45, CFI = 1, RMSEA (90% CI) =
0.000; Grade 2: 2 (48) = 66.485, p < .05, 2 /df = 1.38, CFI = 0.810, RMSEA
(90% CI) = 0.056 (0.013-0.086); and Grade 3: 2 (48) = 70.239, p > .05, 2 /df
= 1.46, CFI = 0.875, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.061 (0.025-0.090).
Vocabulary. Receptive and expressive vocabulary skills were assessed separately

with two standardized tests. Specifically, receptive vocabulary was measured using the Greek standardization of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Simos,
Sideridis, Protopapas, & Mouzaki, 2011; Protopapas, Simos, Sideridis & Mouzaki,
2012). Children were asked to identify one picture out of four that best represented the orally given word. There were 173 items of increasing difficulty. Test
administration was stopped when the child gave 8 incorrect answers within 10
consecutive questions. The total number of correct responses was the score for
receptive vocabulary.
The vocabulary subtest of the Greek standardization of the third edition of the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Georgas, Paraskevopoulos, Bezevegis,
& Giannitsas, 1997) was used as a measure of expressive vocabulary. The children
were asked to give definitions of words of increasing difficulty. The test was
discontinued after four consecutive zero-scoring responses. The score for expressive vocabulary skills was the total number of correct definitions. According to
the manual, the internal consistency of the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler

1017

Intelligence Scale for Children (Cronbach ) ranges from 0.62 to 0.81 for ages
from 6 to 8 years (Grades 1 to 3).
Word reading and reading comprehension were measured with
the relevant subtests of Greek standardized tests, which assessed four aspects of
reading: decoding, fluency, morphology-syntax, and comprehension. Specifically,
in Grades 1 and 2 word reading (decoding) was assessed with the decoding subtest
of the NewTELA reading test (Padeliadu, Antoniou, & Sideridis, in press), and in
Grade 3, with the decoding subtest of the TestA (Padeliadu & Antoniou, 2007).
The decoding subtest of the TestA included three tasks asking children: (a) to read
a list of 24 pseudowords of increasing difficulty, (b) to read a list of 53 real words
of increasing difficulty, and (c) to distinguish between real words and pseudowords
(totally 36 real words and pseudowords). The correct response was scored with
1. The word reading (decoding) score in Grade 3 was calculated by adding up
the scores on these three tasks (maximum correct score = 113). According to
the manual of the TestA, the internal consistency (Cronbach ) for the decoding
subtest is 0.770.
The decoding subtest of the NewTELA (Grades 1 and 2) included four tasks
asking children: (a) to read a list of 40 pseudowords of increasing difficulty, (b)
to read a list of 57 real words of increasing difficulty, (c) to distinguish real
words and pseudowords from a mix of 33 real words and pseudowords, and
(d) to identify the word out of three options (real words and pseudowords) that
best represented a given picture (26 words were tested totally). Reading words
(decoding) score in Grades 1-2 was calculated by adding up the scores on these
four tasks (maximum correct score = 156). The correct response was scored with
1. The internal consistencies (Cronbach ) for pseudoword reading, real word
reading, word distinction, and word identification are 0.929, 0.964, 0.872, and
0.847, respectively (Padeliadu, Antoniou, et al., in press).
Reading comprehension in Grades 1 and 2 was measured with the reading
comprehension subtest of the NewTELA (Padeliadu, Antoniou, et al., in press),
and in Grade 3, with the reading comprehension subtest of the TestA (Padeliadu
& Antoniou, 2007). The comprehension subtest in both the NewTELA and TestA
contained two tasks assessing the same skills: identification of two equivalent
semantically sentences from four options (for all grades the maximum correct
score was 4), and understanding of texts with seven multiple choice questions
(Grades 1-2: six texts, maximum correct score = 42; and Grade 3: three texts,
maximum correct score = 21). For each grade, a combined score for reading
comprehension resulted from adding up the scores on the two tasks of reading
comprehension (Grades 1-2: maximum correct score = 46 and Grade 3: maximum
correct score = 25). Generally, the correct response was scored with 1. The internal
consistency (Cronbach ) for the reading comprehension subtest of TestA is
0.816 (Padeliadu & Antoniou, 2007). For the NewTELA (Padeliadu, Antoniou,
et al., in press), the internal consistency (Cronbach ) for the task of identification
of two equivalent semantically sentences is 0.670, whereas for each of the six texts
the Cronbach  ranges from 0.816 to 0.899. Specifically, for Text 1 and Text 3,
 = 0.853; for Text 2,  = 0.865; for Text 4,  = 0.899; for Text 5,  = 0.870;
and for Text 6,  = 0.816.

RESULTS

All analyses were conducted within grade using raw scores for all variables and
adopting a level of significance at .05. Provided that reading skills in third grade
were measured with different tests than in Grades 1-2, we also calculated the
standard scores for these. Standard scores allow us to compare raw scores that
come from different metrics. Descriptive statistics for all measures are presented in
Table 1, according to grade. Performance on both morphological awareness tasks
appeared to increase by grade level (Kruskal-Wallis tests, p < .001), indicating
developmental differences across all three grades. However, scores on the noun-
adjective inflection task and the verb inflection task did not reach maximum
performance even in Grade 3, pointing to important lack of mastery. Within all
grades, there were statistically significant differences between the two inflectional

tasks (Wilcoxon tests, p < .001 across the three grades), with verb inflection being
a more difficult task than the noun-adjective inflection.
Correlations between reading skills and oral language skills are reported separately for each grade in Table 2. Noun-adjective inflection was significantly and
moderately correlated with decoding skills in all grades. On the contrary, verb
inflection correlated significantly with both reading skills only in first and third
grades. It is interesting that the correlations between noun-adjective inflection
and reading skills decreased by grade, while the correlations between verb inflection and reading increased. Phonological awareness correlated with decoding
skills across all three grades and with reading comprehension in Grades 1 and
3. The analysis of the data also showed that receptive vocabulary correlated
only with reading comprehension in all grades, whereas expressive vocabulary
skills correlated with both decoding and reading comprehension in Grades 1
and 3. Finally, it is interesting to note that phonological awareness was significantly related to both noun inflection and verb inflection only in Grades 1 and
3. In Grade 2, phonological awareness was correlated only with noun-adjective
inflection, and this correlation was smaller than those found in the other two
grades.
Separate standard multiple regression analyses within each grade were used to
explore the predictive value of each aspect of inflectional morphological awareness. Phonological awareness, receptive vocabulary, expressive vocabulary, noun-
adjective inflection, and verb inflection were entered into the equation at the
same time. The results of these analyses (Table 3) indicated how well these
oral language skills can predict the two distinct reading outcomes. Furthermore,
they allowed us to assess the unique contribution of each of them to reading
skills.
The analysis showed that only in first grade did noun-adjective inflection make
a statistically significant contribution to reading words ( = 0.259), which however was smaller than the contribution of phonological awareness ( = 0.525).
Phonological awareness was the unique predictor of word reading in Grades 2
and 3, and the most important in Grade 1. The combination of all the predictor
variables accounted for a greater amount of variance in word reading in Grades 1
and 3 than in Grade 2, Grade 1: R2 = .441, F (5, 114) = 17.965, p < .001; Grade
2: R2 = .138, F (5, 117) = 3.753, p < .01; and Grade 3: R2 = .262, F (5, 120) =
8.501, p < .001.
As for reading comprehension, inflectional morphological awareness was found
to be a significant predictor only in Grade 3. Specifically, verb inflection made a
significant contribution to reading comprehension ( = 0.224) followed by phonological awareness, while receptive vocabulary was the most important predictor.
The model of all the predictor variables explained a greater amount of variance
in reading comprehension in Grades 1 and 3 than in Grade 2, Grade 1: R2 =
.466, F (5, 114) = 19.865, p < .001; Grade 2: R2 = .317, F (5, 116) = 10.751,
p < .001; and Grade 3: R2 = .348, F (5, 120) = 12.788, p < .001. Phonological
skills contributed to reading comprehension in Grade 1 as well. In all grades, the
receptive vocabulary was the most important predictor of reading comprehension
and it was the unique one in Grade 2. It is interesting that in Grade 1 both
vocabulary skills contributed to this reading skill.

We further investigated the independent contribution of noun-adjective inflection and verb inflection to first-grade word reading and to third-grade reading
comprehension, respectively, after controlling for the effect of the other predictor
variables. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted for word
reading in Grade 1 and for reading comprehension in Grade 3. The results of
these analyses are reported in Table 4, with each line representing the amount of
variance explained by each variable, after controlling for the effect of the remaining

It was revealed that in Grade 1 noun-adjective inflection explained an additional 4.2% of the variance in word reading after controlling for the effects of
phonological awareness, F change (1, 114) = 8.648, p < .001. The contribution of
inflectional morphology was smaller than the contribution of phonological awareness. As far as verb inflection is concerned, the hierarchical multiple regression
analysis indicated that in Grade 3 it accounted for an additional 3.3% of the reading
comprehension, F change (1, 120) = 6.094, p < .05.

DISCUSSION

In the current study, we investigated the contribution of two aspects of inflectional
morphology to word reading and reading comprehension in Greek-speaking children (Grades 1-3). We found that noun-adjective inflection awareness contributed
uniquely only to word reading in Grade 1, while verb inflection awareness predicted only Grade 3 reading comprehension. We also aimed at providing some
preliminary data for the development of noun-adjective and verb inflection awareness in the Greek language.
Our findings indicated significant developmental differences in the acquisition
of these inflectional morphological awareness skills through the first 3 years of
schooling. The increase in the performance on the two inflectional tasks was
expected on the basis of previous research in inflectional morphology, though
these were documented in languages with deep orthography and a less complex
inflectional system (e.g., Berko 1958, as cited in Kuo & Anderson, 2006; Casalis
& Luis-Alexandre, 2000). Our study suggested that in the beginning of formal
literacy instruction, Greek-speaking children have some knowledge of inflectional
morphology, and they are able to manipulate the inflectional morphemes. This
finding is consistent with the results reported in Berko (1958), as cited in Kuo and
Anderson's (2006) and Casalis and Luis-Alexandre's (2000) studies, which were
conducted from kindergarten to Grade 2. These studies in English and French
languages demonstrated an improvement in the performance on inflectional tasks
throughout the first years of schooling. However, contrary to Casalis and LuisAlexandre (2000), our study showed that the performance on noun-adjective
inflection and verb inflection tasks did not reach the maximum levels in Grade 2, or
even in Grade 3. In the study by Casalis and Luis-Alexandre (2000), children scored
higher on inflectional tasks that included real verbs and real nouns-adjectives than
on tasks containing pseudowords, and their scores were approximately at ceiling
levels. The complex inflectional morphological system of the Greek language and
the fact that target inflections were assessed within a sentence, whereas in Casalis
and Luis-Alexandre (2000) the inflectional suffixes were assessed out of context,

Applied Psycholinguistics 36:4

could account for the difference between our results and the French study. The
development of morphological awareness in the Greek language during the first
3 years of schooling has been also presented by Padeliadu and Rothou (2011),
who explored the derived and compound awareness in Grades 1-3. The researchers
administered oral morphological awareness tasks to typically developing children,
and they revealed developmental differences and, of more importance, a moderate
performance for third graders.
Our study also suggested that in each grade, Greek-speaking children faced
greater difficulty with verb inflections than with noun-adjective inflections. Similarly, in English, Berko (1958; cited in Kuo & Anderson, 2006) found that for
both kindergarteners and first graders, the plural of nouns was easier than the
formation of verb tenses. However, Casalis and Luis-Alexandre (2000) did not
demonstrate an effect of type of inflection on the performance of children when
they were given tests with real words. The difficulty of Greek-speaking children
in morphological awareness tasks could be due to the content and the structure of
these tasks. However, both noun-adjective and verb inflection tasks contained real
words of high frequency in the oral and written vocabulary of these grades, and the
target inflections were included in sentences with simple structure. Furthermore,
the concept of two measures has been used in research studies with children at this
age (e.g., Deacon, 2011; Muter et al., 2004). Therefore, the reported difficulty of
the children in our study is more likely to be due to the morphologically demanding
system of the Greek language. In Greek, inflections in verbs and articles-nouns-
adjectives are many more in number and more complicated than in other alphabetic
languages, such as English or French. In conclusion, our results demonstrated developmental differences in the mastery of inflectional morphology and suggest that
morphological awareness may develop later in more complex languages, although
the latter finding needs further investigation with longitudinal studies.
Our main research question was whether and to what extent noun-adjective
inflection and verb-inflection awareness can contribute to early reading skills. The
results documented that inflectional morphological awareness can be an important
predictor of reading in a language with shallow orthography and rich morphology. It is interesting that in second grade none of the two aspects of inflectional
morphology contributed to reading skills, while in Grades 1 and 3, awareness of
inflectional morphology had different effects on reading. Nevertheless, the use of
different reading tasks in Grade 3 may have confounded these results, and this
raises the possibility of these results being an artifact of the reading tasks used.
The finding that inflectional morphology did not contribute to reading outcomes
in second grade agrees with Casalis and Luis-Alexandre's (2000) study. In the
French langauge, Casalis and Luis-Alexandre (2000) demonstrated that first- and
second-grade performance on inflectional tasks did not predict the reading skills
in first and second grades, respectively. However, our study in Greek found that
only noun-adjective inflection was predictive of word-reading skills in first grade.
Similarly, Rispens et al.'s (2008) study with first-grade Dutch-speaking children
documented that noun inflection was a significant predictor of word reading. It is
more interesting that, in Greek, the independent contribution of noun-adjective
inflection to word-reading skills was at the same level (4.2%) with that found in
the Dutch language (4%).

However, in contrast to previous research studies (e.g., Deacon, 2011; Muller
& Brady, 2001), our study did not support the predictive role of verb inflection
for first-grade reading outcomes. Greek-speaking children appear not to use verb
inflections until later, in third-grade reading comprehension. By the end of their
first year of schooling, children have acquired some preliminary knowledge of
verb inflections, but they have not yet mastered it. Thus, in Grades 1-2 students
may not be capable of applying this knowledge when they read, because they have
not developed it yet.
It is interesting that, in Greek, the independent contribution of verb inflection
to reading comprehension (3.3%) was larger than the reported contribution to
decoding skills in Deacon's (2011) study, wherein the respective contribution was
1%-2%. Both Muller and Brady (2001) and Deacon (2011) revealed a significant
contribution of verb inflections to first-grade reading comprehension and firstgrade word reading, respectively, without taking into account the impact of noun
inflection. It is important to note that in our study the impact of verb inflection on
reading outcomes was assessed simultaneously with the impact of noun-adjective
inflection. In order to test whether our results for first-grade children might have
been different if we had not entered into the same regression equation both aspects
of inflectional morphology, we proceeded in an analysis taking out noun inflections. Again, verb inflection did not have an impact on first-grade reading skills.
Furthermore, we need to underline that in the present study, the verb inflection
task measured fully the knowledge of verb inflections and did not assess only past
tense transformations as Muller and Brady (2001) and Deacon (2011) did.
The finding that inflectional morphological awareness was not a predictor of
either word reading or reading comprehension in second grade is consistent with
the results reported in two other studies in the Greek language (Padeliadu, Rothou,
et al., in press; Rothou et al., 2011), which assessed derivational and compound
awareness. The present study showed that in Grade 2, children's phonological
awareness skills were developed in higher levels than in first grade. Taking into
consideration the transparency of the Greek orthographic system, it can be suggested that Grade 2 readers, who have become phonologically strong, did not
need to use morphological awareness as much as the phonologically weaker, first
graders did. Similarly, in Grade 3, Greek-speaking children decoded words using
only phonological processing knowledge. It is further interesting to note that none
of the inflectional tasks were associated with reading comprehension in Grades
1 and 2. It can be hypothesized that for beginning readers, even though they had
acquired inflectional morphology, they were not yet able to apply it for facilitating
the text understanding, as the older children did.
Overall, the data in this study and in previous ones lead us to hypothesize that in a
morphologically demanding language, children appear to use morphological skills
either in the beginning or in the consolidated phase of reading development. That
is, they use it when they actually possess it and when they need it. In second grade,
Greek-speaking children are more competent in morphological processing than in
first grade, whereas in third grade, they deal with more complex morphological
structures and reading material as well. In the third year of schooling, Greek
children are taught explicitly both the use of advanced tenses (e.g., present perfect
and future) in syntactic parsing of the sentences and the applying rules as well. On

the contrary, during the first two grades, tenses are usually taught implicitly, via
experience and within specific contexts, and thus children in these grades might
not yet be able to generalize this knowledge. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that
longitudinal and intervention studies could provide evidence for or against this
hypothesis.
The present study has some limitations, which however can be used as a basis
for future research in the field of reading. One limitation is that the inflectional
morphological awareness tasks did not contain pseudowords but only real words.
The inclusion of pseudowords in morphology tasks could ensure that children's
performance on these tasks was not mediated by their vocabulary skills. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that our study did not explore separately the contribution of
morphological awareness to real and pseudoword reading. Perhaps the predictive
role of morphological processing skills for these types of reading accuracy could
differentiate through the first three grades, and especially in first and second
grades, when the children learn the rules of decoding and they usually rely on
phonological awareness to read. Finally, our study was a cross-sectional one, and
therefore it does not allow us to support causal relations between the variables. A
longitudinal study or a training study could disentangle these relations. Furthermore, a longitudinal study would provide more definite data on the development
of inflectional morphological awareness.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that in a language with shallow
orthography and a complex inflectional morphological system, inflectional morphological awareness may develop later on and can be a significant predictor of
early reading skills of Greek-speaking children. Specifically, it suggests that in
the Greek language, verbal inflectional morphology may have an important effect
on the development of later reading comprehension, whereas noun-adjective inflectional morphology influences only Grade 1 decoding. It appears that in Greek,
decoding in Grade 1 relies on both phonological and morphological processing
skills, despite the transparency of writing system. On the basis of the present
data, it would be useful to explore the contribution of inflectional morphology to
reading fluency, given that Greek-speaking children become accurate readers at
the end of the first year of formal reading instruction.
