EEG network modularity, as a proxy for cognitive plasticity, has been proposed to be a more reliable neural
marker than power and coherence in predicting learning outcomes. The present study examined the associations
between resting state EEG network modularity and both L1 Chinese and L2 English literacy skills among 90 Hong
Kong first to fifth graders. The modularity indices of different frequency bands were highly correlated with one
another. An exploratory factor analysis, performed to extract a general modularity index, explained 77.1% of the
total variance. The modularity index was positively associated with Chinese word reading, Chinese phonological
awareness, Chinese morphological awareness, and Chinese reading comprehension but was not significantly
correlated with English word reading or English morphological awareness. Findings suggest that resting state
EEG network modularity is likely to serve as a reasonable, reliable, and cost-effective neural marker of the
development of first language but not second language literacy skills.

1. Introduction
Literacy skills are very important in modern society. Poor literacy
skills may lead to unfavorable consequences for academic achievement,
career success, and psychological well-being. Hence, identifying neural
markers which facilitate or predict literacy skills has high practical
significance in developmental cognitive neuroscience. Theoretically,
identifying neural markers associated with literacy skills may help to
determine which neural processes are involved in language develop
ment and reading disability. Many previous studies have focused on
examining neural markers of literacy skills measured while an individ
ual is performing a task, such as a Chinese character or word decision
(Lo, McBride, Ho, & Maurer, 2019; Lui, Lo, Maurer, Ho, & McBride,
2020; Tong et al., 2016; Zhao, Maurer, He, & Weng, 2019), a one-back
color repetition detection task (Zhao et al., 2014), and a word-symbol
one-back task (Maurer et al., 2006). In contrast, relatively few studies
have examined the neural markers identified when an individual is in a
resting state.
Theoretically, spontaneous neural activity during rest has been

suggested to be a hallmark of the internal state of the brain (Sadaghiani,
Hesselmann, Friston, & Kleinschmidt, 2010); spontaneous neural ac
tivity captures some fundamental neurobiological characteristics of the
neural system. These fundamental properties of the brain influence how
the brain processes external information and generates behaviors
(Sadaghiani et al., 2010) and have been found to be associated with
various cognitive abilities. The present study assessed neural modu
larity, i.e., the extent to which the brain is functionally organized into
segregated modules (Gallen & D'Esposito, 2019); we also examined the
associations of neural modularity with first and second language literacy
skills. It has been suggested that resting state network modularity is a
proxy for cognitive plasticity, which is highly predictive for learning
outcomes in various cognitive domains (Gallen & D'Esposito, 2019).
Cognitive mechanisms underlying language learning are modular in
nature (Sparks & Ganschow, 1993). As a result, we expected that the
network modularity assessed using resting state EEG paradigms should
be predictive of literacy skill development.

Note. For age of the participants, study 3 and study 8 were longitudinal studies with three waves. Study 2, 10, 12, 13 reported only the average age of the participants.
For the frequency bands, "positive" indicates a positive relationship between resting state power and language abilities or lower power in participants with reading
disabilities; "negative" indicates a negative relationship between resting state power and language abilities or higher power in participants with reading disabilities;
"no diff." indicates not significant association was found between resting state power and language abilities or no significant difference was found between participants
with reading disabilities and the control group.

1.1. Introduction to the resting state EEG paradigm

has been linked to sensory processing (e.g., Weiss & Rappelsberger,
1998), and beta and gamma coherence have been linked to semantic and
syntactic processing (e.g., Weiss & Rappelsberger, 1998; also see Weiss
& Mueller, 2003 for a review). Research findings about the relations
among EEG power, coherence and language development, however, are
not very consistent across studies.

Resting state electroencephalography (EEG) measures the neural
activity of an "idling" brain, which means that the participant does not
engage in an active task during the EEG recording. Spontaneous neural
activity at rest is thought to reflect baseline perceptual and cognitive
processing, which may allow the examination of fundamental neurobi
ological characteristics of the neural system that are not associated with
particular task-related strategies (Fraga Gonzalez et al., 2016; Papa
giannopoulou & Lagopoulos, 2016). Resting state EEG, which examines
the dynamics of spontaneous neural activity, has also been suggested to
provide meaningful information about long-range communication
across brain areas and the underlying architecture of functional brain
networks (Fraga Gonzalez et al., 2018). In addition, resting state EEG is a
cost-effective method to identify neural markers that could predict
various human behaviors. EEG paradigms using reading-related tasks
usually require a lot of trials for each experimental condition in order to
achieve good reliability, while a resting state paradigm typically lasts for
between 2 (e.g. Arns, Peters, Breteler, & Verhoeven, 2007), 3 (e.g.
Benasich, Gou, Choudhury, & Harris, 2008; Gou, Choudhury, & Bena
sich, 2011; Papagiannopoulou & Lagopoulos, 2016) and 5 min (e.g.
Babiloni et al., 2012). A short EEG paradigm is particularly useful for
infants and children who have difficulty in sitting still for a long time
and performing complex cognitive tasks.
Typical analyses for resting state EEG usually involve spectral power
and coherence analyses. Power spectrum is obtained by transforming
the EEG signals from the time domain into the frequency domain, i.e.,
frequency analysis, which is usually performed using the Fourier
transformation. Coherence is basically the covariation of power spectra
of two EEG signals. Coherence values lie between 0 and 1, and a high
coherence value between two EEG channels suggests high cooperation
and synchronization between underlying brain regions. EEG power
alone does not provide any coupling information, while the coherence
between two sites has been interpreted as evidence of a functional
connection between the underlying cortical areas (Marosi et al., 1995).
EEG power and coherence measures of different frequency bands have
been linked to different cognitive processes. For example, high and low
alpha power may represent inhibitory and excitatory cognitive processes
respectively (Klimesch, Sauseng, & Hanslmayr, 2007). Gamma power
has been linked to various higher-level cognitive processes such as
attention, memory, and language (Benasich et al., 2008). For coherence,
theta coherence has been linked to language-related mnemonic pro
cesses (e.g., Weiss, Mueller, & Rappelsberger, 2000), alpha coherence

1.2. Relations among resting state EEG Power, Coherence, and language
abilities
As shown in Table 1, research findings among the fifteen studies
examining the relationships between resting state EEG power and lan
guage abilities that we could identify and review yielded mixed results.
These mixed findings basically occurred across all frequency bands,
including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Perhaps the frequency
band with the most inconsistent findings is the alpha band. Among the
15 studies, 5 of them found lower resting alpha power in children with
reading disabilities as compared to typically developing children
(Babiloni et al., 2012; Clarke, Barry, McCarthy, & Selikowitz, 2002;
Colon, Notermans, Weerd, & Kap, 1979; Harmony et al., 1995; Sklar,
Hanley, & Simmons, 1972), 3 of them found the opposite result pattern,
with higher resting alpha power in children with reading disabilities as
compared to typically developing children (Duffy, Denckla, Bartels, &
Sandini, 1980; Pinkerton, Watson, & McClelland, 1989; Schiavone et al.,
2014), and 7 of them found no difference in resting alpha power be
tween children with reading disabilities and typically developing chil
dren (Arns et al., 2007; Benasich et al., 2008; Garcia, Portellano,
Cabanyes, & Gonzalex, 1989; Gou et al., 2011; Papagiannopoulou &
Lagopoulos, 2016; Rumsey, Coppola, Denckla, Hamburger, & Kruesi,
1989; Tierney, Strait, & Kraus, 2014).
Findings regarding the relation between resting state EEG coherence
and language abilities were also mixed. Sklar et al. (1972) found higher
intra-hemispheric alpha coherence and lower inter-hemispheric theta
and beta coherence in children (7-18 years old) with dyslexia as
compared to children in a control group. Shiota, Koeda, and Takeshita
(2000), however, found both higher intra-hemispheric alpha coherence
and inter-hemispheric alpha and beta coherence in children with
dyslexia than in typically developing children (7-14 years old). In
another study comparing the resting state EEG coherence between two
attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder combined types (AD/HD), with
or without comorbid reading disabilities (RD), Barry, Clarke, McCarthy,
and Selikowitz (2009) showed that the AD/HD group (8-12 years old)
with reading disabilities showed lower intra-hemispheric delta
2

K.F.H. Lui et al.

coherence in the left hemisphere and lower alpha coherence across
hemispheres while there were no significant inter-hemispheric differ
ences between the two AD/HD groups for all frequency bands. In
addition, Marosi et al. (1995) have found a frequency-dependent effect
such that children (7-11.2 years old) with poor reading and writing
ability in general showed higher coherence in the delta, theta, and beta
bands but lower coherence in the alpha band compared with children
with good reading and writing abilities. Arns et al. (2007), however,
found that children (8-16.3 years old) with dyslexia showed increased
EEG coherence in the frontal, central, and temporal regions for all fre
quency bands as compared to the control children. In one training study
with Quadrato Motor Training (QMT), Ben-Soussan et al. (2014) showed
that the participants (mean age = 30 years) with dyslexia had higher
inter-hemispheric alpha coherence than the controls (mean age = 27
years) both before and after training and there were no training effects
on the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) coherence for either partici
pants with dyslexia or controls. However, in another training study with
neurofeedback training (NFT), Nazari, Mosanezhad, Hashemi, and
Jahan (2012) found an interesting change toward normalization of EEG
coherence for various frequency bands for 6 children (8-10 years old)
with dyslexia. In particular, the lower than normal delta coherence was
increased to near normal and the higher than normal theta and beta
coherences were decreased to near normal after the NFT training.
There is consensus that the heterogeneous findings of the associa
tions among EEG power, coherence, and language abilities were prob
ably caused by differences in the ages of the participants, degrees of
language disability, and methodological differences in EEG data
collection and analysis (Babiloni et al., 2012; Schiavone et al., 2014;
Weiss & Mueller, 2003). For example, Tierney et al. (2014) proposed
that resting gamma power follows a maturational trajectory that peaks
at age 4 and decreases thereafter, and this explains why both Benasich
et al. (2008) and Gou et al. (2011) found a positive relationship between
resting gamma power and language abilities in preschoolers while they
found a negative relationship between resting gamma power and lan
guage abilities in adolescents. It is unclear whether the differences in
participants and methodology can account for all the mixed findings.
Nevertheless, a reliable neural marker that is not sensitive to the subtle
methodological differences and can predict language abilities across
populations, such as network modularity (Gallen & D'Esposito, 2019), is
practically valuable.

connectivity; children with dyslexia, however, showed lower leaf frac
tion and higher diameter for the theta band, suggesting a less integrated
network organization and less efficient communication between
network nodes in children with dyslexia compared to controls. In a
follow up study, Fraga Gonzalez et al. (2018) performed again the MST
analysis on resting state EEG data obtained from 28 participants with
dyslexia (mean age = 23.14 years) and 36 typically reading adults
(mean age = 22.22 years). Participants with dyslexia were found to
show more interconnected nodes than typical readers, reflecting
reduced presence of specialized sub-networks in participants with
dyslexia compared to typically reading adults.
Network modularity is one of the indices characterizing the brain
network properties which can be used to quantify the extent to which
the brain sub-networks, or modules, are segregated from other subnetworks. A neural network has high modularity if it has many con
nections within its modules and has sparser connections between the
modules. Network modularity has been proposed to represent cognitive
plasticity. Hence, network modularity is presumed to be positively
associated with learning outcomes because a highly modular network
(1) has many connections within modules which allow faster processing
and reduce network wiring costs and hence are more adaptable to
changing external demands in learning a new task and (2) has few be
tween module connections, so that each module is relatively indepen
dent from other modules which leads to increased flexibility in learning
(see Gallen & D'Esposito, 2019 for a review). Network modularity can
not only be computed from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data but also from EEG data. For example, Chennu et al. (2017)
examined EEG network modularity on patients (5-73 years old) with a
disorder of consciousness and found that patients with higher modu
larity showed more positive clinical outcomes one year later. Gallen and
D'Esposito (2019) have also suggested that network modularity is a
more reliable neural marker than other types of brain measurements
such as regional brain volume and EEG power since the relationship
between network modularity and training-related cognitive control
gains were reliably observed (1) across a variety of populations, ranging
from patients to healthy individuals with different educational back
grounds; (2) across several different interventions such as therapies,
physical fitness interventions, and cognitive training; and (3) across
studies adopting different methodologies in modeling the neural
network and optimizing the modularity. If network modularity is a
reliable neural marker in predicting cognitive plasticity and learning
outcomes, it should be positively associated with language abilities too.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been few, if any,
studies that have examined the relationships between network modu
larity and language abilities.

1.3. Graph analysis and network modularity
Graph analysis is a relatively new technique in analyzing resting
state EEG data; it allows modeling of the whole brain functional con
nectivity network based on graph theory. Graph theory is a mathemat
ical approach which uses graphs to represent networks and examines the
network properties. A graphical representation of the brain network
consists of a set of individual units called nodes and the connections
between nodes called edges. Various indices can be computed to quan
tify the network properties, indicating efficiency of the neural network
such as the global and local efficiency of information transfer (see
Bullmore & Sporns, 2009 for a review). There have been a few attempts
to perform graph analysis on resting state EEG data and to examine the
relationships between network properties and language abilities. Dimi
triadis et al. (2013) performed graph analysis, specifically a detrended
fluctuation analysis (DFA), on resting state MEG data obtained from 23
children with reading difficulties and 27 typically developing children
(7-14 years old): Reading impaired children showed reduced global
efficiency in all frequency bands and reduced local efficiency in the beta
band when compared with the control group. Fraga Gonzalez et al.,
2016 performed graph analysis, specifically a minimum spanning tree
(MST) analysis, on resting state EEG data obtained from 29 third-grade
children with dyslexia (mean age = 8.46 years) and 15 third-grade
control children (mean age = 8.75 years). Children with and without
dyslexia did not differ significantly in the power and functional

1.4. Factors influencing first and second language development
The question concerning what factors influence first language (L1)
and second language (L2) development has been widely studied. For
example, cognitive factors such as intelligence and working memory are
associated with both L1 and L2 reading performance (Geva & Ryan,
1993). However, compared to L1, cognitive factors explain only a small
portion of variance in L2 reading performance (Geva & Siegel, 2000).
This is probably because, apart from cognitive factors, L2 language
learning is also affected by affective, social, and environmental factors.
Gardner, Lalonde, and Moorcroft (1985) found that participants with
higher integrative motivation learned L2 French vocabulary words in a
paired associate learning paradigm better than did those with lower
integrative motivation. In addition, anxiety is also a crucial factor
influencing second language acquisition (for a review, see Horwitz,
Horwitz, & Cope, 1986). Finally, the resources available to children, the
amount of exposure to a second language, and the richness of the second
language learning environment are also significant predictors of L2
learning outcomes (Palfreyman, 2006; Paradis, 2011). Given this, if
network modularity is measuring cognitive plasticity, it should

influence language learning and should be associated with the learning
outcomes of L1 to a larger extent than with that of L2.

1.5. The present study

2.2. Procedure

The present study was part of a large-scale longitudinal twin study
conducted in Hong Kong examining both neural and genetic factors
underlying early literacy development. The present study examined the
relations between resting state EEG neural network modularity and lit
eracy skills in both Chinese (the first language, L1) and English (the
second language, L2). Participants were 90 pairs of Chinese twins from
grades 1 to 5 who studied in Hong Kong. To conform to the independent
observation assumption in the general linear model, only one child's
data from each twin pair was selected for the analyses. EEG activity was
recorded for 3 min while the children were asked to keep their eyes open
without performing any tasks. Among the 15 EEG resting state studies
reviewed in Tables 1, 5 of them adopted an eyes-open design, 6 of them
adopted an eyes-closed design and 4 of them adopted both. We chose the
former design because asking children to keep their eyes open while
fixated on a fixation cross may result in less eye movement artifacts than
asking them to keep their eyes closed. A whole brain neural network
modularity index was then computed for each individual and for each
frequency band. As there were few previous studies about EEG network
modularity and it was not clear from previous research what the func
tional roles of the network modularity of different frequency bands are,
we first explored the associations among the network modularity indices
across frequency bands. In cases in which the correlations among the
network modularity indices were high, common network modularity
factors were extracted by performing an exploratory factor analysis.
After that, the network modularity was correlated with the literacy skills
in both the first and second languages.
The literacy skills for both L1 Chinese and L2 English were assessed
using behavioral tasks. For English, only basic word reading ability and
morphological awareness were assessed. For Chinese, apart from word
reading ability and morphological awareness, phonological awareness
and reading comprehension were also assessed. It was hypothesized that
the neural network modularity would be positively associated with
Chinese reading performance and literacy skills since a higher neural
network modularity indicates larger cognitive plasticity and better
learning outcomes. For English, we did not have specific predictions. On
the one hand, larger cognitive plasticity should lead to better learning
outcomes in general and, hence, better English reading performance and
literacy skills. On the other hand, in addition to cognitive plasticity,
second language acquisition is also affected by affective, social, and
environmental factors; hence, it was less clear to what extent neural
network modularity would correlate with second language literacy
skills.

Children completed a behavioral session and an EEG testing session,
on average, held within 2 months of each other. They completed the
behavioral measures either in their homes or their primary schools. For
the EEG session, they were individually tested in a sound-attenuated lab
in the Department of Psychology of the Chinese University of Hong
Kong. The EEG activity was collected using the HydroCel GSN EGI 128channel system (EGI net station, Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene,
Oregon).
2.3. Behavioral measures
2.3.1. Chinese word reading (CWR)
The children were given items adapted from The Hong Kong Test of
Specific Learning Difficulties in Reading and Writing (Ho, Chan, Tsang,
& Lee, 2000), which includes 150 two-character words. The items were
arranged in order of increasing difficulty. The task was stopped when the
child failed to read 15 consecutive items. The total number of words they
read correctly served as the indicator of their word reading performance.
2.3.2. Chinese phonological awareness (CPA)
Phonological awareness was tested using a task which included both
syllable deletion and onset deletion items (Yang, McBride, Ho, & Chung,
2019). For the syllable deletion section, the children were asked to take
away one syllable from three-syllable phrases (e.g., dai6 mun4 hau2
without mun4 would be dai6 hau2). This part consisted of 4 practice
items and 19 testing items. Half of the items were real words and half
consisted of nonsense syllables that conformed to the phonological
constraints of Cantonese. In the onset phoneme deletion section, the
children were asked to take away the initial phoneme of the Cantonese
words. For example, tsa1 without the initial sound would be a1. This
part consisted of 4 practice items and 22 test items. One point was given
for each correct item and the maximum possible score was 41.
2.3.3. Chinese morphological awareness (CMA)
In the Morphological Construction Test (e.g., McBride-Chang, Shu,
Zhou, Wat, & Wagner, 2003), for the first 27 items, scenarios were orally
presented in three-sentence stories. One example is: "If we see a web
weaved by a spider, we call that a spider web (zi1 zyu1 mong5). What
should we call if we see a web weaved by an ant?" The correct answer, in
this case, is ant web (maa5 ngai5 mong5). Thus, children were asked to
actively construct new compounds for newly presented objects or con
cepts based on previously acquired morphemes. For the remaining 19
items, children were not given scenarios anymore. One point was given
for each correct answer and the maximum possible score was 46.

2. Method
2.1. Participants

2.3.4. Chinese reading comprehension (CRC)
In this task, children were asked to read in silence a total of three
narrative or expository passages. The passage lengths varied between 67
and 130 Chinese characters. For each passage, children were asked to
answer questions in either the multiple choice or open-ended format.
Two practice items were given to the participants before the testing
ones. One point was awarded for each correct answer to each multiplechoice question and, at maximum, two points for each open-ended
question which contained one or two main ideas. The full marks for
this task were 24 points.

Ninety-nine pairs of Chinese twins from grades 1 to 5 participated in
the current study. Nine pairs were ultimately excluded from the analyses
because both children in each pair yield less than 1-minute data after
EEG pre-processing. To conform to the independent observation
assumption in the general linear model, only one child's data from each
twin pair was selected for the analyses based on the data quality. The 90
children, including 33 males and 57 females, ranged between 6.58 and
12.42 years old (M = 8.17, SD = 0.99). All the participants were native
Cantonese speakers, not previously diagnosed as having developmental
dyslexia, and had normal or corrected to normal visual ability. Informed
consent was obtained in written form from the parents. The study pro
tocol was approved by the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics
Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref. CUHK8/CRF/
13G/2300035) and the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New

2.3.5. English word reading (EWR)
The English word-reading task was adopted from Tong and McBrideChang (2010). It taps English word-reading skills for both Chinesespeaking children learning English as a second language and English
-Chinese bilingual children studying English as a first language. Fifty

beginning and the end of the paradigm. The data were then down
sampled to 100 Hz to facilitate subsequent independent component
analyses to produce better decomposition by cutting off unnecessary
high-frequency information. An independent component analysis (ICA)
was then performed on the continuous EEG data with an optimization
algorithm - CUDAICA (Raimondo, Kamienkowski, Sigman, & Slezak,
2012). Components related to eye movement artifacts were then
removed using ADJUST (Mognon, Jovicich, Bruzzone, & Buiatti, 2011).
After that, the continuous EEG data were filtered with a 40 Hz low-pass
filter and then divided into adjacent intervals of four seconds. Finally,
epochs with absolute voltage values larger than 100 V at any electrodes
were removed. Nine pairs of twins with less than 1-minute of data (15
epochs) after these preprocessing steps were excluded from further
analyses.

items were arranged according to children's reading levels as well as the
complexities of the word meanings and phoneme combinations. A
stopping rule was applied if children read four consecutive words
incorrectly. The total number of words they read correctly served as the
indicator of their word reading performance.
2.3.6. English morphological awareness (EMA)
We assessed English compounding awareness with two sections
including morpheme compounding and compounding production
(McBride-Chang, Wagner, Muse, Chow, & Shu, 2005). In the first sec
tion, children were first presented with the definition of a real com
pound word and then asked to create a novel compound word using the
same pattern, e.g., a dishwasher is a machine that you use to wash
dishes. What should we call the machine that we use to wash spoons?
(spoonwasher). There were 15 items in this section and one point was
awarded to each correct answer. For the compounding production sec
tion, children were asked to create a word for an object or concept orally
without given examples in English, e.g., what do we call a monster that
only eats pizza? (pizza-eating monster). This section contained 5 items
and each response was scored as ranging from 0 to 4. The possible
maximum score of this test was 35.

2.6. EEG modularity analysis
A modularity analysis was performed for the following frequency
bands (Babiloni et al., 2012): delta1 (0.5-2 Hz), delta2 (2-4 Hz), theta
(4-6 Hz), alpha1 (6-8 Hz), alpha2 (8-10 Hz), alpha3 (10-12 Hz), beta1
(12-20 Hz), beta2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz). For each fre
quency band, cross-channel phase coherence analyses, implemented in
EEGLab, were performed for all pairwise combinations of the 128
channels resulting in a 128 by 128 phase coherence matrix. For each
frequency band, the corresponding phase coherence matrix was then
used as input for computing a whole brain neural network modularity
index using the heuristic Louvain algorithm (Blondel, Guillaume, Lam
biotte, & Lefebvre, 2008). The algorithm aims at extracting the network
structure with the highest network modularity through optimizing the
modularity iteratively. The modularity of the extracted network is
computed as the ratio between the density of connections within mod
ules and that between modules. Following Chennu et al. (2017), the
algorithm was repeatedly run 50 times to minimize the randomness of
the iteration processes and then the outputs across the 50 runs were
averaged to be the final neural network modularity index.

2.3.7. Nonverbal IQ (NVIQ)
Nonverbal IQ were assessed by the Raven's Standard Progressive
Matrices (Raven, Court, & Raven, 1976). There were 60 items in this
standardized measure, with five sets (Sets A to E) of 12 items each.
Following the test user manual, participants who were less than 8.5
years old at the time of testing were administered the short form with 36
items (Sets A to C) while older participants were given the full version.
For each item, children were presented a geometric matrix with a
missing piece and were required to select a piece out of six to eight
choices to best complete the matrix. One point was awarded to each
correct response. The maximum score was 60.
2.3.8. Verbal working memory (WM)
Backward digit span test was used to assess children' verbal working
memory. For each trial, a random sequence of one-syllable Cantonese
digits was played via a MP3 player at a rate of one digit per second.
Children were required to recall orally the sequence of digits in the
reverse order. There were 16 trials of 8 different lengths for the digit
sequence ranging from 2 to 9 (2 trials for each). The trials were pre
sented in the order of increasing sequence length starting with a twodigit sequence. One practice trial of two-digit sequence was given
before the actual test. The task was stopped when the children answered
2 consecutive trials incorrectly. One point was awarded to each correctly
backward recalled trial. The maximum score of this task was 16.

2.7. Statistical analyses
To conform to the independent observation assumption in the gen
eral linear model, only one child's data from each twin pair was selected
for the analyses. For each twin pair, the child who attained more epochs
than his or her co-twin after EEG pre-processing was selected. The re
lations among network modularity index of the nine frequency bands
were first examined by performing correlation analyses. As the corre
lations were very high, an exploratory factor analysis was performed to
extract a general factor underlying the modularity index. The effects of
age and gender on the network modularity factor were then examined
by performing a correlation analysis and an independent-sample t-test,
respectively. Partial correlations between the general modularity factor
and both the L1 Chinese and L2 English literacy skills after controlling
for age and gender were finally obtained. Age was statistically controlled
because age was highly associated with the literacy skills while gender
was statistically controlled because a large gender difference in the
network modularity was observed. In addition, generalized least squares
regression models, with the second set of children included, were also
performed to examine whether the same results can be replicated if the
paired structure of the twin data was considered in the analysis. Finally,
although the main purpose of the current study was not to examine the
EEG power, EEG power analyses were performed and the results are
reported in the Appendix.

2.4. Eyes-open resting-state paradigm
In the EEG session, children participated in a three-minute eyes-open
resting-state paradigm in which their EEG activity was recorded while
they were asked to keep their eyes open and fixate on a fixation cross
presented on a computer for three minutes without performing any
tasks. They were seated at a distance of 80 cm from the stimuli pre
sentation computer monitor and were also asked to sit as still as possible.
2.5. EEG recording and preprocessing
EEG was recorded using the HydroCel GSN EGI 128-channel system
(EGI net station, Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, Oregon) at a sam
pling rate of 500 Hz and with the Cz electrode as the online reference. A
0.1 Hz high-pass filter was applied for the acquisition. Electrode
impedance levels were set at less than 50 k. Preprocessing steps were
carried out using EEGLAB v14.1.2 (Delorme & Makeig, 2004). The first
10 s and the last 10 s of the continuous EEG data were firstly removed to
exclude noisy data caused by body movements of the children at the

influences from higher level cognitive processes, a second set of partial
correlation analyses was also performed by additionally controlling for
nonverbal IQ and verbal working memory. Table 5 shows the results of
both the zero-order correlation and the partial correlation analyses.
As shown in Table 5, for zero order correlation analyses, network
modularity was only significantly and positively associated with Chinese
phonological awareness and Chinese reading comprehension. For par
tial correlation analyses, network modularity was significantly posi
tively associated with Chinese word reading, r(88) = 0.216, p = .043,
Chinese phonological awareness, r(87) = 0.328, p = .002, Chinese
morphological awareness (marginally significant), r(87) = 0.209, p =
.052, and Chinese reading comprehension performance, r(88) = 0.340,
p = .001, suggesting that higher network modularity was associated
with better performance in Chinese reading and literacy skills. For En
glish, network modularity was not significantly correlated with word
reading performance, r(88) = 0.132, p = .222 or morphological
awareness, r(88) = 0.106, p = .326. Fig. 1 shows the scatter plots of all
the partial correlations, statistically controlling for age and gender. The
results of the second set of partial correlation analyses which addition
ally controlled for nonverbal IQ and verbal working memory were

selected for the subsequent analyses. Means, standard deviations,

measures were acceptable with reliability coefficients ranging from 0.67
to 0.99.

3.2. Correlations between network modularity and literacy skills
Correlational analyses were first performed in the network modu
larity index of different frequency bands. As shown in Table 3, all the
correlations were significant and higher than 0.5, rs(88) greater than
0.8, ps less than 0.001. As all the correlations in the network modularity
index of different frequency bands were very high, an exploratory factor
analysis was performed to extract a general network modularity factor
across frequency bands. The general network modularity factor
explained 77.1% of the total variance. Table 4 shows the component
matrix of the factor solution.
The effects of age and gender on the general network modularity
factor were then examined by performing a correlation analysis and an
independent-sample t-test, respectively. Age was not significantly
correlated with the general network modularity factor, r(88) = 0.081, p
= .448. In contrast, a large gender difference in the general network
modularity factor was found with females (M = 0.27, SE = 0.13)
showing a significantly larger network modularity than males (M =
- 0.46, SE = 0.16), t(88) = 3.53, p < .001. Since a large gender differ
ence in the network modularity was found and age was highly associated
with the literacy skills (rs > 0.3, ps < 0.003), partial correlation analyses
were performed to examine whether the general network modularity
factor was associated with both L1 Chinese and L2 English literacy skills,
statistically controlling for age and gender. To rule out the potential

ficient for network modularity was significant for all L1 Chinese literacy
skills, suggesting that network modularity tends to be positively asso
ciated with L1 Chinese literacy skills even taking into consideration the
paired structure of the twin data in the model.

significantly and moderately correlated with the Chinese language
measures, including Chinese word reading, Chinese phonological
awareness, Chinese morphological awareness, and Chinese reading
comprehension. The correlations showed that higher network modu
larity was associated with better performance in Chinese reading and
literacy skills. On the other hand, the general neural network modularity
index was not significantly correlated with either English word reading
or English morphological awareness.

4. Discussion
The present study examined the associations between neural
network modularity computed from resting state EEG activity and both
L1 Chinese and L2 English literacy skills of grade 1 to grade 5 Chinese
children. The neural network modularity indices of different frequency
bands were highly correlated with each other. The general neural
network modularity index extracted among the indices of various fre
quency bands through an exploratory factor analysis was also

4.1. Resting state EEG network modularity as a proxy for cognitive
plasticity
The present study found that the whole brain network modularity
computed from resting state EEG data was positively associated with
various L1 Chinese literacy skills including word reading, phonological
awareness, morphological awareness (marginally significant), and
8

reading comprehension. These findings provide support for the theo
retical argument that neural network modularity represents cognitive
plasticity (Gallen & D'Esposito, 2019). Although the EEG data were
collected at the scalp level, the phase coherence estimates of phase re
lationships should be partially invariant to volume conduction (Chennu
et al., 2017; Fraga Gonzalez et al., 2018); hence, the modularity index
computed based on the phase coherence matrix should be a valid indi
cator for brain network modularity. A neural network with high
modularity has many connections within modules which allow for faster
processing (Coltheart, 1999) and reduce network wiring costs (Clune,
Mouret, & Lipson, 2013). Meanwhile, a high modularity neural network
also has few connections between modules which results in a neural
network with relatively independent modules and so increases the
flexibility in learning (Ellefsen, Mouret, & Clune, 2015). The higher
modular organization of the neural network and larger cognitive plas
ticity, in turn, lead to better learning outcomes in various cognitive
domains, including the Chinese language acquisition assessed in the
current study. This was consistent with previous behavioral studies
suggesting a positive association between L1 Chinese literacy skills and
different cognitive abilities including visual spatial skill (e.g., Lin, Sun, &
Zhang, 2016; Liu, Chen, & Chung, 2015; McBride-Chang, Chow, Zhong,
Burgess, & Hayward, 2005) and executive functioning (Zhang, 2016). In
addition, high cognitive plasticity should be beneficial in general for
different cognitive domains, consistent with the current findings
showing that neural network modularity was associated with L1 Chinese
language skills in different processing levels.

4.3. Resting state EEG network modularity as a reliable neural marker
The current findings also provide support for the suggestion that
neural network modularity is a reliable neural marker (Gallen &
D'Esposito, 2019). The present study has shown that it can be used to
predict L1 Chinese reading acquisition for typically developing children
across the primary school grades. In contrast to the inconsistent findings
of the previous resting state EEG power studies (as shown in Table 1),
the current findings were consistent with studies by Fraga Gonzalez
et al. (2016) and Fraga Gonzalez et al. (2018), which performed graph
analysis on resting state EEG data and found a less integrated network
organization and reduced presence of specialized sub-networks in chil
dren and adults with dyslexia as compared to typically reading children
and adults, respectively. The clear theoretical interpretation for the
neural network modularity in terms of cognitive plasticity is intriguing
and provides theoretical evidence supporting the reliability and validity
of the neural network modularity as a neural marker in predicting
learning outcomes across cognitive domains.
Compared to EEG power and coherence, which were shown to be
frequency dependent, network modularity appears to be relatively fre
quency independent. The general neural modularity index extracted was
able to account for 77.1% of the total variance of the neural modularity
indices across frequency bands ranging from delta (0.5-4 Hz) to gamma
(30-40 Hz). This is consistent with findings from a previous study
(Joudaki, Salehi, Jalili, & Knyazava, 2012) showing that the relation
ships between various graph metrics of EEG data, including network
modularity and network size, were highly similar across frequency
bands. This implies that the cognitive plasticity measured by the neural
network modularity is frequency independent and probably relatively
general across cognitive domains. As a result, the positive associations
between network modularity and learning outcomes have been reliably
observed across studies examining different cognitive domains (Gallen
& D'Esposito, 2019). Meanwhile, it is a cost-effective neural marker
which can be assessed using a short (e.g., 3 min in the current study) and
simple EEG paradigm. Taken together, resting state EEG network
modularity is practically valuable as a reliable, valid, and cost-effective
neural marker in predicting learning outcomes in various cognitive
domains.
It is also worth noting that the sample size of the current study was
relatively large in comparison to previous studies examining the re
lationships between resting state EEG power and language abilities. The
sample size of the 15 studies, summarized in Table 1, ranged from 18 to
99 with a mean sample size of 47. Therefore, the sample size of the
current study with 99 pairs of twins was more than double the mean
sample size of previous studies. In addition, the current study was
conducted on a twin sample which allowed us to select the child with
higher quality of EEG data from each twin pair. Taken together, the
current study has found evidence from a relatively large sample with
good data quality supporting an intriguing possibility that resting state
EEG network modularity can serve as a reliable neural marker to predict
literacy skills in the first language of Chinese. Future research, however,
is needed to attempt to replicate the findings in different samples who
are learning to read in a different first language.

4.2. Cognitive plasticity predicts only L1 Chinese language skills
As Chinese is the first language of the children in the current study,
the current findings suggest that first language acquisition is closely
related to individual cognitive plasticity. The lack of significant corre
lations between network modularity and English word reading perfor
mance and morphological awareness suggests that second language
learning may not benefit a lot from the highly modular neural system.
This seems to support the claim that the modular systems of the brain
may fail or function inefficiently in second language learning (Sparks &
Ganschow, 1993). Another possible explanation is that second language
learning may also be affected by affective factors such as motivation
(Gardner et al., 1985) and anxiety (Horwitz et al., 1986), as well as
social factors such as resources available to children (Palfreyman, 2006;
Paradis, 2011). In Hong Kong, all children learn English in school from
an early age, but families and schools differ tremendously in terms of
how they value learning this language and the resources they have
available for facilitating such learning.
Another possible explanation for the neural network modularity
being positively associated with L1 Chinese language skills but not L2
English language skills, however, is that Chinese and English are quite
different in the properties of the writing system. In a behavioral study,
Tavassoli (2002) showed that spatial memory was marginally better for
Chinese characters and words in native Chinese speakers than for En
glish words in native English speakers (Experiment 1), and spatial
memory for symbols was better in native Chinese speakers than in native
English speakers (Experiment 2). Chinese characters are more visually
complex than English words and with a greater grapheme inventory size
than English with about 5000 commonly used characters (Lee, 2000). In
addition, the orthography-phonology association is relatively arbitrary
in Chinese. Perhaps Chinese skills are more related to cognitive plas
ticity than English language skills due to these differences in the writing
system. The data from the current study are not able to differentiate
these two different accounts of the results. It is also possible that both
factors play a role in influencing the associations between language and
cognition. Future research can examine the association between neural
network modularity and the development of various L1 languages to
provide additional information.

4.4. Limitations
There are, however, two limitations to note for the present study.
First, correlation does not imply causation. The correlations found be
tween neural network modularity and Chinese reading performance
may not guarantee that higher neural network modularity is the cause of
better literacy development. Future studies should assess both the neural
network modularity and reading performance longitudinally and
examine these relations in the development of both. Second, there were
fewer English reading measures included in the current study than the
Chinese reading measures. In addition, more robust effects were found
for Chinese phonological awareness and Chinese reading
9

comprehension which were not assessed in English. Therefore, one
should be cautious in interpreting the non-significant associations be
tween neural network modularity and L2 English language acquisition.
Nevertheless, the present study underscores ways in which behavioral
and neural measures can be considered together to understand cognitive
development fully.

alpha (6-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz) and for the
following regions of interest: frontal area (Fp1, Fp2, AF3, AF4, AF7, AF8,
AFZ, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, Fz), central area (C1, C2, C3, C4),
temporal area (T7, T8, T9, T10), parietal area (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7,
P8, Pz) and occipital area (O1, O2, OZ). The partial correlations, sta
tistically controlling for age and gender, of EEG ERSP with Chinese and
English literacy skills were then examined. As shown in Table A1, only 5
out of 150 correlations were significant. It can be concluded that there
were in general no associations between EEG ERSP and literacy skills.

4.5. Conclusion
The current study found that the whole brain network modularity
index computed based on resting state EEG data, collected from Chinese
primary school children, was positively associated with L1 Chinese lit
eracy measures, including word reading, phonological awareness,
morphological awareness, and reading comprehension but not L2 En
glish word reading and morphological awareness. The neural network
modularity appeared to be frequency independent and associated with
Chinese reading performance at both the word level and text level,
suggesting that it may represent the general cognitive plasticity of an
individual. It was associated with L1 Chinese measures but not L2 En
glish measures, perhaps at least in part because L2 literacy acquisition
tends to be more affected by affective and social factors. It is also
possible that Chinese and English literacy skills have differential prop
erties that influence this association. Nevertheless, the current findings
were highly consistent with previous behavioral studies showing
stronger cognitive correlations for L1 Chinese than L2 English and pre
vious graph analysis studies showing reduced presence of specialized
sub-networks in children and adults with dyslexia. Taken together, the
present study has suggested that resting state EEG network modularity is
a potentially reliable and valid neural marker in predicting L1 Chinese
literacy development.
