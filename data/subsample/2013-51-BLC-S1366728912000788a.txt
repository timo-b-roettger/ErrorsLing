The relation between language proficiency and executive functions has been established for monolingual children. The
present study addresses this issue in bilingual children, comparing the language proficiency of sequential English-Hebrew
bilingual preschool children as determined by standardized assessment instruments and generic executive control in
inhibition, sorting and shifting tasks. Participants were recruited from regular and language preschools and classified
according to their language proficiency as bilinguals with high language proficiency in at least one of their languages
(including balanced bilinguals with high language proficiency in both languages, L2-dominant, and L1-dominant) and
bilinguals showing low language proficiency in both languages. As reported for monolingual preschool children, positive
relationships between language proficiency and inhibition and shifting abilities were found, with significantly lower
performance among low language proficiency bilinguals. Significantly better performance was also found for shifting among
children who had already mastered their L2 compared to those who were still in the process of acquiring the new language.

Introduction
Bilingualism is speaking two languages and being able
to flip between them as a function of topic, listener
and psycholinguistic and sociopragmatic motivations
(Walters, 2005). Bilingual children can be balanced or
dominant; that is, they can show high or low linguistic
proficiency in both languages or only in one but not
the other. Abutalebi and Green (2007) suggest that
brain activation in bilinguals varies as a function of
proficiency level in the second language (L2). This was
found not only in regions of the cortex traditionally
involved in first language (L1) processing, but also
in regions known to sustain generic executive control.
They attribute this variation to the constant activation of
monitoring processes associated with the need to filter
out irrelevant information and to inhibit inappropriate
responses. Others (e.g., Im-Bolter, Johnson & PascualLeone, 2006; Montgomery, 2000, 2002) argue that
language proficiency in monolinguals echoes the ability
to perform on tasks which involve generic executive
functions, such as inhibition, concept generation, and
shifting. These researchers reported differences in generic
executive functions between monolinguals with typical

language development (TLD) and monolinguals with low
language proficiency, diagnosed with Specific Language
Impairment (SLI).
The present study examines whether the relationship
between language proficiency and performance on tasks
which involve generic executive functions, observed
among monolinguals (e.g., Bishop & Norbury, 2005;
Kohnert & Windsor, 2004), is also apparent among
bilingual children. The investigation of this relationship
is expected to shed light on the role of generic
executive function abilities in language acquisition,
thus contributing to an understanding of the relation
between language proficiency and executive control in
impaired populations as well. Hypothetically, the bilingual
experience could override possible differences in general
executive functions and lead to flattening the potential gap
in the performance on generic executive functions among
bilingual children.
There is currently no consensus about how to
define operationally the language proficiency construct
in bilingualism for classifying bilingual children (see
Kohnert, 2010). One possible division of bilingual
children was implemented by Walters (1979) in a study
of 32 Spanish-English bilingual children, who were
assessed by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT)
(Dunn & Dunn, 1981) prior to performing a pragmatic
task involving making requests. In analyzing the data,
the author distinguishes three groups of bilinguals: (1)
highly balanced bilinguals, (2) unbalanced bilinguals (the
L1-dominant and the L2-dominant groups), and (3)

Language proficiency and executive control
bilinguals who exhibited low proficiency in both
languages (an LLP group).
The current study proposes that the non-balanced
bilinguals in the two groups who display dominant
bilingualism are qualitatively different from each other
in terms of language acquisition. The L1-dominant group
includes those who have difficulty in acquiring a second
language despite being highly proficient in L1, while the
L2-dominant group includes those who became highly
proficient in L2 but show language attrition in L1 (e.g.,
Bahrick, 1984; Cohen, 1986). When both groups have the
same length and amount of exposure to L2, the ability
to acquire a second language suggests that the linguistic
proficiency of the L2-dominant group is higher than that
of the L1-dominant group.
Thus, we propose that the high language proficiency
group includes three sub-groups: a group with balanced
high language proficiency and two groups with intermediate level language proficiency. Bilingual children who
score within the monolingual norm on standardized measures in both languages are considered to have "balanced
high language proficiency" (BHLP); bilingual children
who score within the norm in L1/English, but score below
norm in L2/Hebrew, are considered L1-dominant with
intermediate level language proficiency; and bilingual
children who score within the norm in L2/Hebrew, but
below norm in L1/English are considered L2-dominant
with intermediate level language proficiency. With this
division, we test a continuum in which the bilingual
population is divided into the following four groups
ranging from a high to a low level of language proficiency:
BHLP > L2-dominant > L1-dominant > LLP.
While language proficiency can be measured by
standardized language tests, general cognitive executive
control is measured by performance on tasks that measure
generic (non-linguistic) executive functions, such as
inhibition, updating working memory, attention, sorting,
planning, and shifting (e.g., Andeson, 2002; Miyake,
Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, Howerter & Wager, 2000).
These generic executive functions are believed to be
the building blocks of abilities to direct, organize, and
mediate problem solving activities, and are used to
monitor and plan behavior and to help focus on targets
(Lezak, Howieson & Loring, 2004). Miyake et al. (2000)
found that working memory, inhibition, and shifting
are generic (non-linguistic) executive functions which
are separable constructs, though moderately correlated.
The main generic executive function abilities which are
examined in the present study are: inhibition - the ability
to ignore and filter distracting irrelevant information
held in working memory, sorting (concept generation)
- the ability to abstract information from non-identical
items, and shifting (mental flexibility) - the ability to
switch attention back and forth between mental sets (e.g.,
Baddeley, 1996). The following sections will focus on the

885

executive functions tested in the present study: inhibition,
sorting and shifting.
Generic executive functions have a protracted course of
development, beginning in early childhood and continuing
into adolescence (e.g., Gathercole, Pickering, Knight &
Stegmann, 2004). This has been shown to be related to
the slow maturation of the prefrontal cortex (Diamond,
2002). Studies testing inhibitory control found an increase
throughout childhood, reaching an adult level of performance in late childhood, around the age of 12 (e.g., Van
den Wildenberg & Van der Molen, 2004). Similarly, studies investigating task shifting show that switching costs
between tasks decrease as children grow older, with adult
levels of performance being attained around the age of 12
(e.g., Kray, Eber & Lindenberger, 2004). Smidts, Jacobs
and Anderson (2004) found, however, that a developmental spurt in mental flexibility (shifting) appears from the
age of four, with refinement occurring after the age of five.
Executive control and language proficiency in
monolinguals
The relation between generic executive functions and
language proficiency in monolingual children usually
builds on a comparison between children with typical
language development (TLD) and children with Specific
Language Impairment (SLI). Children with SLI, exhibit
typical social-emotional development, hearing and motorspeech abilities, and have IQs within the normal range, but
have receptive and/or expressive language abilities below
age expectations (e.g., Im-Bolter et al., 2006; Leonard,
1998). That is, children with SLI have low language
proficiency as indicated by performance on standardized
measures, e.g., the Clinical Evaluation of Language
Fundamentals (CELF; Wiig, Secord & Semel, 1992) or
the Test of Language Development (TOLD; Newcomer
& Hammill, 1997). While bilingual children have been
shown to outperform monolingual children on tasks that
involve generic executive functions, monolingual children
with typical language development outperform children
with SLI on tasks which involve executive control.
This latter observation suggests a correlation between
linguistic proficiency and generic executive functions.
Studies testing general executive function abilities in
children with SLI show deficits in basic general cognitive
and perceptual processing mechanisms as well as shortterm memory and working memory (Kohnert & Windsor,
2004). For example, Finneran, Francis and Leonard
(2009) examined inhibition skills by measuring sustained
attention in 4-6-year-old children with and without SLI
using a visual continuous performance task (CPT). In
this task participants monitor for target stimuli (e.g., a
red circle) while inhibiting distractor stimuli (red square).
Finneran et al. (2009) report that children with SLI were
less accurate than children with TLD, concluding that

886

children with SLI have reduced capacity for sustained
attention, i.e., they demonstrate lower inhibition (see also
Spaulding, Plante & Vance, 2008). Marton (2008) further
shows that children with SLI have a weakness in attention
switching, inhibition, non-verbal problem solving and task
switching. More specifically, Kiernan, Snow, Swisher and
Vance (1997) suggest that children with SLI are impaired
in their ability to inhibit prepotent responses (see also
Bishop & Norbury, 2005), and they may be unable to make
efficient use of their capacity due to deficits in general
executive function. Im-Bolter et al. (2006) propose that
children with SLI have a limited processing capacity that
is domain-general rather than domain-specific, and that
they perform more poorly than children with TLD on
tasks of updating and inhibition.
Leonard, Ellis Weismer,Miller, Francis, Tomblin and
Kail (2007) suggest that the limited language skills
children with SLI have could be the result of a lifetime of
functioning with limited non-linguistic processing skills.
For example, if general, non-linguistic working memory
capacity is limited, it will be more difficult to keep active
non-syntactic information during syntactic computation.
Thus, general non-linguistic processing limitations may
exacerbate children's language difficulties and, possibly,
serve as one of its chief causes. Supporting this view,
Miller, Kail, Leonard and Tomblin (2001) suggest that
the limitations children with SLI have in general nonlinguistic processing slows down their processing of
linguistic information and their linguistic development.
In the same vein, Im-Bolter et al. (2006) propose
that the deficits of children with SLI in general nonlinguistic updating and inhibition abilities affect their
efficient use of resources for deactivating irrelevant
information in language tasks. Moreover, their limited
general non-linguistic processing capacity may explain
their linguistic difficulties, since effective use of language
requires coordination of one's linguistic, general cognitive
and social skills, and availability of general cognitive
resources (memory capacity, inhibition, etc.). Finneran
et al. (2009) further suggest that the reduced capacity
for non-linguistic sustained attention among children
with SLI could contribute to the language learning
difficulties they encounter. However, Kohnert, Windsor
and Ebert (2009) point out that the question whether nonlinguistic and linguistic deficits in SLI are related due to
a common underlying neurological deficit or a general
motor, perceptual and cognitive weakness resulting in
language deficits is still unresolved.
Bilingualism and generic executive functions: Is
bilingualism an advantage?
While studies of monolinguals show a disadvantage
for children with SLI in generic executive control
abilities, studies investigating general cognitive control

and generic executive control abilities in bilinguals show
advantages among bilinguals throughout the lifespan
in comparison to monolinguals, with these processes
developing earlier in bilingual children (e.g., Ben-Zeev,
1977; Bialystok, 1999, 2008; Goetz, 2003; Kovacs &
Mehler, 2009). Table 1 presents a list of studies which
show this bilingual advantage over monolinguals for
generic executive functions.
Most of these studies do not take into account
that there are different types of bilinguals in terms of
their language proficiency in the two languages, and
that these differences might influence the bilinguals'
performance on tasks that measure generic executive
function abilities. The current study attempts to address
this issue by comparing bilinguals with different levels of
proficiency in the two languages. That is, it attempts to
explore whether these differences in language proficiency
correlate with the bilinguals' abilities to perform on tasks
that measure generic executive functions.
Bialystok, Craik, Klein and Viswanathan (2004),
among others, suggest that the bilingual advantage over
monolinguals in generic executive functions can be
attributed to the bilingual need to deal constantly with two
languages. This is suggested to be the case, since cortical
regions underlying generic executive function have been
found to be involved and trained in resolving conflicts
in language processing resulting from interference of a
non-target language in target-language production (e.g.,
Rodriguez-Fornells, De Diego Balaguer & Munte, 2006).
Hence, it appears that bilinguals have more resources
and more efficient resources for performing on tasks
which involve non-linguistic conflicts (Bialystok, 2008).
Imaging studies confirm these findings showing that
the brain areas which play a major role in different
aspects of generic executive functioning (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulated cortex,
and the supplementary motor area) are also activated in
dual language processing (e.g., Rodriguez-Fornells et al.,
2006).
Hypothetically, this kind of training of generic
executive function brain regions in bilingual situations
has the potential of narrowing the gap in generic
executive function between less proficient and more
proficient speakers. In bilingual situations, general
cognitive abilities are recruited to control dual language
use (e.g., Rodriguez-Fornells et al., 2006), and the use of
more than one language may improve control and selfregulation of general cognitive processes. Alternatively,
it could be the case that the participants tested in the
current study (all of whom are sequential bilinguals
with at least two years of L2 exposure) will all benefit
from their dual language exposure to the same extent,
and the gap found in monolinguals may be preserved
in bilinguals as well. Finally, a third alternative is that
less proficient speakers will benefit less from bilingual

exposure than more proficient speakers and the gap
between more proficient and less proficient speakers will
remain. In this case, bilinguals who differ in their ability
to acquire a second language may show different levels
of performance on tasks that involve generic executive
functions as well. More specifically, highly balanced
bilinguals are anticipated to perform best on generic (nonlinguistic) executive functions compared to other bilingual
groups. This, as mentioned above, is what the present
paper attempts to test.

Research questions and predictions
The present study addresses the question whether
bilingual children with low language proficiency (LLP)
show a lower degree of general cognitive control compared
to bilingual children with high language proficiency;
alternatively, is it the case that the bilingual language
experience has a remedial power, narrowing or even
closing the gap between more proficient and less proficient
speakers? This will be explored by testing whether
bilingual children with different levels of language
proficiency in L1 and in L2 perform differently on tasks
that involve generic executive functions (a subset of
general cognitive control).
We hypothesize that the higher the language
proficiency of a bilingual in one or both languages is, the
better the bilingual will perform on tasks which involve
generic executive functions. Using both the dichotomous
division between high and low language proficiency
bilingual children (HLP > LLP) and a division into
four groups (BHLP > L2-dominant > L1-dominant >
LLP), this hypothesis yields four predictions regarding
performance on tasks which involve generic executive
control, such as inhibition, sorting, and shifting:

1. Children with HLP will perform better than children
with LLP.
2. Balanced bilingual children with high language
proficiency (BHLP) will perform better than all other
groups of bilingual children.
3. L2-dominant children will perform better than L1dominant and LLP children.
4. L1-dominant children will perform better than LLP
children.
Previous studies compared bilinguals with TLD to
monolinguals with TLD or monolinguals with TLD to
monolinguals with SLI and their performance on tasks
that involve generic executive functions. The current study
focuses exclusively on bilingual children, comparing
different types of bilingual children in terms of language
proficiency and their performance on tasks that involve
generic executive functions.
Method
Participants
The participants were 43 sequential bilingual English-
Hebrew-speaking children, who have been exposed
to L1 English from birth and to L2 Hebrew from
approximately age three in the framework of public
education (preschool). Twenty-two boys and 21 girls aged
4;1-7;1 (mean: 5;7) were tested. The relatively large age
range resulted from the inclusion of three participants
from language preschool who were all approximately
seven years old. In language preschools, many children
remain one more year before they go on to first grade.
However, as reported in the results section, no correlation

888

Peri Iluz-Cohen and Sharon Armon-Lotem

was found between age and performance on sorting or
shifting, with a weak correlation for inhibition.
Twenty-five of the 43 participants were recruited from
three regular preschools for children with no special needs
(regular preschool), located in a middle class town in the
center of Israel. Eighteen children were recruited from
five language preschools for children who were previously
diagnosed with language impairment, located in the same
middle class town. All participants in the present study
conformed to the conventional exclusionary criteria for
SLI. (e.g., no evidence of ADHD, PDD, hearing deficits,
or neurological impairment), and all had performance IQs
within the normal range. In the regular preschools, only
children with performance IQ within the normal range
are enrolled; in the language preschools, reports of the
preschool speech and language therapist with access to the
children's personal files were used to determine eligibility.
Parental consent was received for all children, and the
study was approved by the university review board for
studies involving human subjects as well as by the Israeli
Ministry of Education. All children participated willingly.

Baseline language measures
All children were screened in both English and Hebrew
using standardized instruments to establish their language
proficiency in the two languages. Monolingual norms
were used in both languages to evaluate age appropriate
language proficiency. The decision to use monolingual
norms reflected the wide age range of the present study
which made it impossible to generate age appropriate
scores otherwise. In no way were these norms used
to determine whether the children were linguistically
impaired or not. The Goralnik Diagnostic Test for
Hebrew (Goralnik, 1995) was used to evaluate language
proficiency in Hebrew. This screening tool includes
six parts, each assessing a different linguistic ability:
vocabulary, pronunciation, comprehension (of simple and
complex directions), imitation (of simple and complex
sentences), expressive abilities, and narrative abilities (in
response to picture stimuli). The CELF-2 Preschool (Wiig,
Secord & Semel, 2004) was used to evaluate language
proficiency in English. This diagnostic tool includes seven
sub-tests: sentence structure, word structure, expressive
vocabulary, concepts and following directions, sentence
recall, basic concepts, and word classes (receptive and
expressive). For inclusion in the different groups, the
cut-off score used for L1/English was 1 SD below the
normal monolingual mean. The cut-off score used for
L2/Hebrew was 1.5 SD below the normal monolingual
mean. The latter cut-off point was used to make the
present study comparable to previous studies of Hebrew
monolingual and bilingual children which also used 1.5
SD (rather than 1 SD as a cut-off point). Scores from these

two standardized tests yielded four groups of bilingual
children:
1. Children with balanced high language proficiency
(BHLP) who scored within or above norm in both
languages.
2. Children with a dominant L2 (L2-dominant) who
scored within or above norm in L2, Hebrew, but below
norm in L1/English.
3. Children with a dominant L1 (L1-dominant) who
scored within or above norm in L1/English, but below
norm in L2/Hebrew.
4. Children with low language proficiency (LLP) who
scored below norm in both languages.
Many of the children in the language preschools (10
of 18) showed within-norm proficiency in at least one of
their two languages, and were therefore not classified as
LLP. In addition, two of the 25 children recruited from the
regular preschools scored below norm on the standardized
tests in both languages, and were thus included in the
LLP group. These numbers reflect a tendency to overdiagnose and under-diagnose language impairment in the
bilingual population. Table 2 presents the distribution of
the participants in the four groups, and their linguistic
profile as reflected in their scores on the language
tests in both languages. All groups showed average
scores below the monolingual mean in both English and
Hebrew.
Experimental tasks
Two tasks were administered to measure the degree
of generic executive control ability. The first task, the
E MBEDDED F IGURES TASK (adapted from De Avila &
Duncan, 1980; Pascual-Leone, 1989; Piaget & Inhelder,
1967) tested inhibition. The child was presented with
10 pictures (Kor, 1992), each of which included an
embedded mouse, which he/she was asked to detect as
fast as possible. The pictures were presented in a gradually
increasing level of difficulty, as a function of the amount
of information in the picture, referred to as noise in the
signal detection literature (Green & Swets, 1966). Errors,
non-responses and successful turns were documented. The
degree of inhibition ability is measured by the number
of correct embedded figures identified, ranging from
0 to 10.
The second task was the C LASSIFICATION TASK
(adapted from Ben-Zeev, 1977; Jacobs, Anderson &
Harvey, 2001; Smidts et al., 2004), used to test both
sorting (concept generation) and shifting. The child was
presented with 18 cards which included three different
shapes (circle, triangle, square), and three different
patterns for each shape (no color, partially-colored-shape,

fully-colored-shape). Nine of the cards (out of the 18)
included three representations of each shape (to represent
"many"), and nine cards included one item of each shape
(to represent "one"; see Appendix). The child was asked to
classify the cards into groups (first classification: sorting -
concept generation). Then, after the experimenter had
reordered the cards exactly as they were presented the first
time, the child was asked to reclassify them in a different
way (first shift) and in another way (second shift). When a
child persisted with the same classification twice and did
not switch, the experimenter added a hint or two to help
switching. Successful, unsuccessful, and aided trials were
recorded.
Three measures where used for analyzing sorting and
shifting abilities. The first measure evaluated the degree
of sorting and shifting abilities as an average degree of
success across the three trials. In each trial, the child
received a score which reflected performance on that trial:

a score of 3 when the child succeeded, 2 points when the
child needed one hint, 1 point when the child needed two
hints, or no points when the child was unable to perform
the task.
The second measure addressed each classification
separately in a way which reflected its different cognitive
demands. The first classification tested concept generation
(sorting) - the ability to abstract information from nonidentical items. The second and third classifications tested
the ability to shift once and twice (Jacobs et al., 2001;
Smidts et al., 2004). The second measure focused only
on the second and third classifications, which involved
shifting.
Finally, the third measure focused on the number
of participants who were able to classify the cards
independently, with no explicit directions, under the
assumption that once hints are provided, shifting is no
longer being tested.

Procedure
Data were collected from each child separately in
a quiet room in the preschool. The experimenter
was a Hebrew-English bilingual, and all instructions
were provided in both languages to ensure that the
children understood. Before administering each task,
practice trials were conducted. The order of tasks was
counterbalanced.

Scoring and data analysis
The dependent variable for the Embedded Figures task
was accuracy measured by the number of correct
responses (maximum 10). This task was intended to
measure the level of inhibition abilities. Reaction time was
also measured in this task, but since time was recorded
manually, it was decided to exclude this from the analysis.
The dependent variable for the Classification task was also
accuracy. The task was timed, but it too was excluded for
the reasons mentioned above.
All the results were converted to z-scores for the entire
group of 43 participants to permit comparison of the
means for each group relative to the general average,
and to allow comparability between the tasks which were
scored on different scales. A z-score indicates the number
of standard deviations above or below the mean. It is
calculated by subtracting the population mean from the
individual raw scores and then dividing the difference by
the standard deviation for the entire group.
For each group we calculated the mean z-score,
standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), and
range. ANOVAs were conducted, followed by post-hoc
tests to evaluate significant relationships among the
independent and the dependent variables investigated. For
comparisons approaching significance, effect sizes were
calculated. For possible correlations with gender or age, a
Pearson correlation coefficient was conducted for all the
participants in this study.

Results
Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for all
participants in the study (N = 43) yielded a weak, yet
significant correlation between age and inhibition (r = .33,
p < .05); but no significant correlations were found
between age and sorting and shifting (r = .01), between
gender and inhibition (r = .27), and between gender and
sorting and shifting (r = .27). The correlation between
age and inhibition disappears when the three seven-yearold children were removed from the calculation. Detailed
results (in z-scores) for the relationship between language
proficiency and inhibition on the one hand and sorting
and shifting on the other are presented below, first for

the HLP-LLP dichotomy, and then for the BHLP - L2dominant - L1-dominant - LLP continuum.
Language proficiency and executive control in the
HLP-LLP dichotomy
Table 3 compares the HLP and the LLP groups on
inhibition, sorting and shifting. A two-way ANOVA
examining effects of group and task shows a significant
main effect for group, F(1,41) = 15.86, p < .0003, with
HLP outperforming LLP children, no effect for task (p >
.05), and no significant group x task interaction (p = .19).
Since each task was selected to test a different generic
executive function, the following analyses address each
task separately.
Column 2 in Table 3 presents the mean z-score, SD
and SE for correct responses on the Embedded Figures
task, which tested inhibition. A significant difference was
found between the HLP group (N = 33) and the LLP group
(N = 10) on inhibition, with the HLP group outperforming
the LLP group t(41) = 4.04, p < .0001 (r = .37).
Column 3 in Table 3 presents the mean z-score, SD
and SE for correct responses for all three trials of the
Classification task, which tested sorting and shifting
abilities. The mean score for the entire task (all three
classifications) is a combined score for sorting and shifting
together, rather than a score on shifting only. In terms of
sorting and shifting together (the Classification task), the
HLP group (N = 33) significantly outperformed the LLP
group (N = 10), t(41) = 1.75, p < .04 (r = .45).
Column 4 in Table 3 presents the mean z-scores for
a more detailed analysis of the Classification task for
each classification. The score for the first classification
reflects sorting and concept generation abilities; the
scores for the second and third classifications are for
shifting abilities. A two-way ANOVA investigating effects
of group and classification trial yielded a significant
group x trial interaction (F(2,82) = 3.65, p < .03), but
no main effects for group (p = .1) or task (p = 1).
Post-hoc t-tests showed that for the first classification
(sorting), which tested concept generation, there was
no significant difference between the HLP group and
the LLP group, t(41) = (-0.28), p = .39. However, the
HLP group significantly outperformed the LLP group
both on the second classification, where the first shift
occurs, t(41) = 1.98, p < .03 (r = .37), and on the third
classification when the second shift occurs t(41) = 2.39,
p < .01 (r = .61). These results remained following a
Bonferroni correction.
Column 5 in Table 3 presents the number and
percentage of participants who were able to classify the
cards independently - with no explicit directions, for the
three classifications. Most bilingual children were able to
sort the cards for the first time regardless of their language
proficiency (22 out of 33 children with HLP, i.e., 67%, and

seven out of 10 children with LLP, i.e., 70%). However
most bilingual children with LLP found it difficult to
sort the cards for the second time and required explicit
directions. All children with LLP found it difficult and
required explicit directions to sort the cards for the third
time. That is, they could hardly shift once and were not
able to shift twice at all. On the other hand, more than
a third of the bilingual children with HLP were able to
sort without instructions for the second time (12 out of
33, 36.36%), and some for the third time (seven out of 33,
21.21%).
Summing up, the findings show that HLP children
perform better than LLP children on shifting and
inhibition, but not on sorting. Moreover, some LLP
children find it difficult to sort independently and none can
shift independently more than once, whereas many HLP
children can sort independently and shift independently
once or even twice.
Language proficiency and executive control across the
BHLP - L2-dominant - L1-dominant - LLP continuum
Table 4 compares the BHLP, L2-dominant, L1-dominant,
and the LLP groups on inhibition, sorting and shifting.
A two-way ANOVA examining effects of group and
task yielded a group x task interaction (F(3,39) = 3.49,
p < .03) with a significant main effect for group,
F(3,39) = 6.38, p < .001, but no effect for task (p = 1).
Since each task tests a different generic executive function,
the following analyses address each task separately.
Column 2 in Table 4 presents the mean z-scores
for the number of correct answers on the Embedded
Figures task which tested inhibition. A one-way ANOVA
examining effects of group on inhibition (Embedded
Figures test) resulted in a significant difference between
groups, F(3,39) = 5.88, p < .003, with all HLP groups
(BHLP, L2-dominant, L1-dominant) outperforming the
LLP group (p > .01 with a Tukey post-hoc test for
the difference between LLP and both BHLP and L1dominant, and near significant for the difference between
LLP and L2-dominant) and no significant differences
among the HLP groups. The difference between the HLP
groups and the LLP group was further confirmed by ttests, as follows: BHLP and LLP, t(22) = 3.14, p < .002
(r = .56); L2-dominant and LLP, t(17) = 1.87, p < .04 (r
= .40); and L1 dominant and LLP, t(19) = 3.12, p < .003
(r = .58).
Column 3 in Table 4 presents the mean z-score for
the three trials in the Classification task, which tested
sorting and shifting. A one-way ANOVA examining
effects of group on sorting and shifting yielded a
significant main effect for group, F(3, 39) = 4.23, p < .01.
Post-hoc comparisons showed that when sorting and
shifting were combined, the two more proficient groups -
BHLP (N = 14) and L2-dominant (N = 8) - significantly

outperformed the two less proficient groups - L1
-dominant (N = 11) and LLP (N = 10): BHLP vs.
L1-dominant, t(23) = 2.6, p < .008 (r = .48); BHLP vs.
LLP, t(22) = 2.67, p < .007 (r = .49); L2-dominant
vs. L1 dominant, t(17) = 2.19, p < .02 (r = .41); and
L2-dominant vs. LLP, t(16) = 2.48, p < .01 (r = .53).
However, no significant difference was found between
the two more proficient groups - BHLP and L2-dominant,
t(20) = 0.29, p = .39) - and between the two less proficient
groups - L1-dominant and LLP, t(19) = -0.14, p = .45).
Column 4 in Table 4 presents the mean z-scores
for a more detailed analysis of the Classification task
per classification. A two-way ANOVA for the effects
of group and classification trial resulted in a significant
group x trial interaction, F(6,78) = 2.52, p < .03), with a
significant main effect for group (F(3,39) = 4.12, p < .01),
but no effect for trial (p = 1). Post-hoc t-tests show that in
the first classification trial (sorting), which tested concept
generation, no significant difference was found among
the four groups: BHLP vs. L2-dominant, t(20) = (-0.65),
p = .26; BHLP vs. L1-dominant, t(23) = 1.1, p = .14;
BHLP vs. LLP, t(22) = 0, p = .5; L2-dominant vs.
L1-dominant, t(17) = 1.44, p = .08; L2-dominant vs.
LLP, t(16) = 0.61, p = .28; and L1-dominant vs. LLP,
t(19) = (-0.97), p = .17. However, in the second
classification trial, where the first shift occurs, the two
more proficient groups (BHLP, L2-dominant), which did
not differ significantly in their performance (t(20) = 0,
p = .5), significantly outperformed the LLP group: BHLP
and LLP, t(22) = 2.31, p < .02 (r = .44); and L2dominant and LLP, t(16) = 2.03, p < .03 (r = .45).
No significant differences were found among the other
groups: BHLP vs. L1-dominant, t(23) = 1.48, p = .08;
L2-dominant vs. L1-dominant, t(17) = 1.26, p = .11; L1dominant vs. LLP, t(19) = 0.66, p = .26). Furthermore,
in the third classification trial, where the second shift
occurs, the two more proficient groups (BHLP, L2dominant), which still did not differ significantly in
their performance (BHLP vs. L2-dominant, t(20) = 1.09,
p = .14), nevertheless significantly outperformed the two
less proficient groups (L1-dominant and LLP): BHLP vs.
L1-dominant, t(23) = 3.96, p < .0003 (r = .64); BHLP
vs. LLP, t(22) = 3.75, p < .0006 (r = .62); L2 dominant
vs. L1 dominant, t(17) = 3.29, p < .002 (r = .62); and L2
dominant vs. LLP, t(16) = 3.1, p < .003 (r = .61). The two
less proficient groups also did not differ significantly in
their performance (L1-dominant vs. LLP, t(19) = -0.07,
p = .47).
Column 5 in Table 4 presents the number and
percentage of participants who were able to classify the
cards independently - with no explicit directions - in the
three classifications. Most children in the BHLP group
were able to sort the cards independently for the first
time (10/14; 71.43%), and almost half of them for the
second time (6/14; 42.86%), and for the third time (6/14;

42.86%). Likewise, most children in the L2-dominant
group were able to sort the cards independently for the
first time (7/8; 87.50%), approximately a third of them
for the second time (3/8; 37.50%), and only one for the
third time (1/8; 12.50%). By contrast, less than half of
the children in the L1-dominant group were able to sort
the cards independently for the first time (5/11; 45.45%),
only a few of them for the second time (3/11; 27%), and
none of them for the third time. That is, children with
L1-dominance were not able to shift twice. Finally, many
of those in the LLP group were able to sort the cards
independently on the first trial (7/10; 70%), but only two
of the children (20%) in the LLP group were able to shift
on the second trial, and none of them on the third trial.
Thus, they too were scarcely able to shift once and were
not able to shift twice.
Summing up, the predictions that bilingual children
with higher language proficiency would perform better
than bilingual children with lower language proficiency
on tasks involving generic executive control, such as
the inhibition task, and the sorting and shifting task,
are supported in terms of inhibition and shifting.
Children with higher language proficiency outperform
children with LLP on inhibition. Furthermore, the two
more proficient groups (BHLP, L2-dominant) outperform
the two less proficient groups (L1-dominant, LLP)
on shifting and sorting. No significant difference was
found between the BHLP and the L2-dominant groups,
nor between the L1-dominant and the LLP groups.
While no significant difference was found among the
groups in sorting (concept generation), the current study
found that the two more proficient groups showed
significantly better shifting abilities than the LLP
groups.

Discussion
The question addressed in the present study was whether
there is a relationship between language proficiency
and the abilities to control and self-regulate general
cognitive processes in bilingual children. That is, whether
bilingual children with different degrees of language
proficiency perform differently on tasks which involve
generic, non-linguistic executive functions (inhibition,
sorting and shifting). We hypothesized that the higher
the language proficiency of a bilingual child in one or
both languages is, the better the bilingual child will
perform on tasks involving generic executive functions.
Our findings support this hypothesis, showing that
bilingual children with high language proficiency (HLP)
significantly outperform bilingual children with low
language proficiency (LLP) on inhibition and shifting,
but not on sorting. That is, our study shows no difference
between high and low proficiency bilingual children in

concept generation which is acquired earlier, but do show
a significant difference in later acquired general executive
functions, i.e., inhibition and shifting. When dividing
the HLP group into sub-groups reflecting their graded
linguistic proficiency (balanced-HLP, L2-dominant, L1dominant) and comparing them with the LLP group,
significant differences in inhibition emerge, with all subgroups performing better than the LLP group. However,
for shifting, the two more proficient groups (balancedHLP, L2-dominant) significantly outperformed the two
less proficient groups (L1-dominant, LLP), but no such
difference was found for sorting.
The current study confirmed the first prediction that the
higher the language proficiency of a bilingual in one or
both languages is, the better that bilingual will perform on
tasks involving generic executive functions, i.e., inhibition
and shifting. This prediction was not borne out for sorting.
This finding replicates the finding observed among
monolinguals showing that the relationship between
language proficiency and performance on tasks involving
generic executive functions is also evident among
bilingual children and distinguishes children with HLP
from children with LLP. Furthermore, in the Classification
task which tests sorting and shifting, the results show
that the two groups do not differ in terms of concept
generation (sorting - first classification trial), but that the
HLP group did outperform the LLP group on shifting.
The findings also show that most bilingual children
were able to abstract information from non-identical
items (sorting - concept generation) as expected at this
age. However, most bilingual children with LLP require
explicit instructions to shift (in which case they may
not be shifting, but rather, following directions). Thus,
low language proficiency is apparently an obstacle to
shifting independently. By contrast, more than a third
of the bilingual children with HLP are able to shift
independently at least once, and some are able to shift
independently even twice. The difficulty of the bilingual
children with LLP in this study is reminiscent of the
difficulty reported by Im-Bolter et al. (2006) for inhibition
in children with SLI. Similarly, the findings in the current
study that children with LLP have difficulties in shifting
resonate with previous studies showing that children with
SLI, who by definition have low language proficiency,
exhibit general cognitive deficits even when no language is
involved (e.g., Bishop, 1992; Bishop & Edmundson, 1987;
Bishop & Norbury, 2005; Connell & Stone, 1994; Craig,
1995; Hoffman & Gillam, 2004; Im-Bolter et al., 2006;
Johnston, 1994; Kiernan et al., 1997; Kohnert & Windsor,
2004; Lahey, Edwards & Munson, 2001; Marton, 2008;
Miller et al., 2001; Montgomery, 2000, 2002; Sininger,
Klatzky & Kirchner, 1989; Swisher & Snow, 1994;
Ullman & Pierpont, 2005; Windsor & Hwang, 1999).
However, these findings are not comparable with those
of Im-Bolter et al.'s (2006) and Kiernan et al.'s (1997),

Language proficiency and executive control
which maintain that children with SLI do not have specific
deficits in shifting.
The difference between the present findings and those
of Im-Bolter et al.'s (2006) can be explained by differences
in age: the participants in the present study are much
younger (mean age 5;7) than those in Im-Bolter et al.'s
study (mean age 10;1), and thus are still developing their
general executive function abilities. The different results
suggest that the gap narrows or even disappears with age,
just as the magnitude of the bilingual influence on generic
executive functions changes across the lifespan being most
apparent in changes from early childhood (between four
and seven years of age) to adulthood (Bialystok, 2007;
Craik & Bialystok, 2005). Jacobs et al. (2001) also found
marked improvements in shifting abilities between ages
six and ten, with maturation of adult level of shifting
abilities being attained by age 10.
Im-Bolter et al. (2006) and Kiernan et al. (1997)
tested monolingual children, while the participants in
the present study were bilingual children. Thus, it could
also be that the difference between monolingualism and
bilingualism played a role in the current study as bilinguals
are naturally trained in shifting, and the highly balanced
bilinguals might benefit from this exposure even more
than bilinguals with LLP or less balanced bilinguals.
This speculation is strengthened by the finding that no
difference emerged for sorting between the groups as
sorting is not trained in the bilingual situation more than
in the monolingual situation.
Finally, this difference between the findings here and
those of Im-Bolter et al.'s (2006) can also be ascribed
to a difference in tasks. Im-Bolter et al. (2006) used
tasks which required the participants to read written
language (letters and numbers), produce language and
count. Shifting, in this case, is mediated by written
symbols and/or numbers that must be decoded by the
participants using language, so shifting is not tested
directly. The Classification task used in the present study
taps directly into cognitive shifting without the mediation
or intervention of language. Thus, task differences might
have also contributed to the differences in the findings.
This is further supported by Prior and MacWhinney
(2009), who compared shifting abilities in bilinguals and
monolinguals. They found that a shifting task which
included number reading was unsuitable (less pure and
less appropriate) for testing general non-linguistic shifting
abilities. On the other hand, when they used a task
in which there was more control and isolation of the
general cognitive non-linguistic shifting construct, with
no language reading (shape and color identification),
they found a difference in shifting abilities in bilinguals
compared to monolinguals.
The other three predictions related to the distinctions
within the HLP group between balanced HLP and
unbalanced bilinguals (L1-dominant and L2-dominant).

The results of the present study show that all three
more proficient groups outperformed the LLP group on
inhibition, with no significant differences among the three
HLP groups. The similarity across the HLP groups distinguishes them from the LLP group but not from each other.
In terms of shifting, the results reveal that the two
more proficient groups (BHLP, L2-dominant) show no
significant difference in performance, but outperform
the two less proficient groups (L1-dominant, LLP) that
also do not differ significantly. Furthermore, the two
more proficient groups do not differ significantly on the
first shifting, but outperform the less proficient group.
Similarly, the two more proficient groups do not differ
significantly on the second shifting, but outperform the
two less proficient groups (L1-dominant, LLP), who also
do not differ significantly in their performance. In terms
of shifting, more children with BHLP than children in
any of the other groups were able to shift independently
once or twice. More L2-dominant children were able
to shift independently once or twice than L1-dominant
children, and more L1-dominant children were able to
shift independently once (but not twice) than children
with LLP. None of the children with LLP was able to shift
twice.
As noted above, these findings are compatible with
previous studies of children with SLI who exhibit
cognitive deficits even when no language is involved
(see relevant references above). These findings, again, do
not support Im-Bolter et al.'s (2006) and Kiernan et al.'s
(1997) findings that children with SLI do not have specific
deficits in shifting, for the same reasons as those discussed
above.
A comparison of the findings of the HLP-LLP
dichotomy and the BHLP - L2-dominant - L1-dominant -
LLP continuum in terms of inhibition shows that the
results overlap, since there is no significant difference
among the HLP groups. In terms of shifting, the continuum provides important data on the difference between
bilinguals who have already acquired the L2 and those
who have not, and on the similarity between bilinguals
who have not mastered the L2 and the LLP groups. The
two latter groups find it difficult to acquire the second
language and to shift compared to the BHLP and the L2dominant groups.
Under the assumption that bilingualism exposes and
trains general executive functions, the difference in
shifting between the two highly proficient groups and the
two low proficiency groups suggests that more proficient
bilinguals practice control of intentional shifting between
the two languages and hence are less likely to shift
unintentionally. This seems to increase their ability to
control non-linguistic, cognitive shifting as well, which
provides them with an advantage in general switching,
as Bialystok (2001) also suggested (see also Costa &
Santesteban, 2004; Luk, 2008). The findings for shifting

896

Peri Iluz-Cohen and Sharon Armon-Lotem

may also suggest that a deficit in non-linguistic, cognitive
shifting in the L1-dominant and LLP groups might
lead to the relatively low linguistic profile of these
two groups, supporting the hypothesis that language
proficiency is related to general executive control. These
findings suggest that the L1-dominant and the LLP
groups may share something in common in terms of
language and in terms of shifting. Both these two
groups encounter difficulty in cognitive shifting and also
encounter difficulty in acquiring the second language,
although they may have been exposed to L2 for as long
as the two more proficient groups. Furthermore, the two
more proficient groups, who were able to acquire the
second language to a level of high proficiency, seem to
be more efficient at recruiting generic executive functions
to cope with interference from the non-target language
to the target language during language production
(Iluz-Cohen, 2009; Iluz-Cohen & Walters, 2012).
Our findings further show that the HLP group performs
above average and the LLP group performs much below
average on both inhibition and shifting. In the BHLP -
L2-dominant - L1-dominant - LLP continuum, the BHLP
group performs above the mean of the bilingual group on
both inhibition and shifting, while the L2-dominant group
performs around the mean on inhibition but above the
mean on shifting, and the L1-dominant group performs
above the mean on inhibition but below the mean on
shifting.
These finding contribute to the debate on the
directionality of the relationship between the variables:
language proficiency and generic executive function
abilities. In comparisons between bilinguals and
monolinguals, it was claimed that bilingualism influences
generic executive function abilities (e.g., Bain, 1975;
Ben-Zeev, 1977; Bialystok, 1986, 1999, 2001, 2005,
2007, 2008; Bialystok et al., 2004; Bialystok & Martin,
2004; Bialystok & Ryan, 1985; Bialystok & Senman,
2004; Costa, Hrnandez & Sebastian-Galles, 2008; Diaz,
1983; Green, 1998; Hamers & Blanc, 1989; Prior &
MacWhinney, 2010). However, in the present study among
different types of bilinguals, the question is whether
the findings above also support causal relations in this
same direction. Can the findings here be interpreted
as showing that language proficiency influences generic
executive function abilities, or perhaps it is the case that
generic executive function abilities influence language
proficiency? Or alternatively, perhaps there is no causal
relationship between these two variables? Phrased
differently, is it the case that bilinguals who do worse
on generic executive functions are less successful in the
transition to balanced bilingualism, or do bilinguals who
are successful in the transition to balanced bilingualism
do better on generic executive functions? That is, do
generic executive function abilities of a bilingual influence
the bilingual's ability to become a balanced bilingual

or vice versa? The findings in the present study expose
the possibility that generic executive function abilities
might lead to a certain profile of language proficiency
in bilingual children. A larger samples and a longitudinal
follow up using bilingual norms in evaluating language
proficiency could aid in confirming this proposal and
applying it to bilingual children with SLI.
Conclusions and implications
The aim of this study was to ascertain whether
bilingual children with different degrees of language
proficiency perform differently on tasks which involve
generic executive functions (inhibition, sorting and
shifting) and to shed light on the relationship between
language proficiency and general executive control.
The study shows that the positive relationship between
language proficiency and performance on tasks which
involve generic executive functions, observed among
monolinguals is also found among bilingual children
for inhibition and shifting. The findings point to lower
performance on inhibition and shifting abilities among
children with LLP, with a cut-off point between children
with LLP and all other bilingual children, whether highly
balanced or not. This suggests that the LLP group who
scored below the monolingual norms on standardized tests
might well be at risk for having SLI, giving empirical
support to the notion that a bilingual child can be
diagnosed with SLI only if he/she is impaired in both
languages. The findings also point to a distinction between
bilingual children who already mastered their L2 and
those who are still in the process of L2 acquisition,
in terms of their shifting abilities. In this light, we
suggest that the better one is at shifting, the easier it is to
master the second language. No relationship was found
between language attrition and the generic executive
functions tested, suggesting that attrition is not necessarily
related to internal cognitive abilities, but perhaps to
external sociolinguistic factors.
The findings in the current study also provide us with
some clue for possible directionality in the relationship
between language proficiency and general executive
function abilities. It might be the case that the general
degree of executive function abilities influences or leads
to a certain profile of language proficiency in bilinguals.
That is, the underlying limitations of bilingual children
with LLP as in monolingual children with SLI might be
in generic executive function abilities which influence
their language proficiency. This is supported by a few
studies which indicate that general cognitive treatments
result in somewhat improved language performance in
adults with aphasia, an acquired language impairment
(e.g., Kohnert, 2004). Future developmental studies could
aid in determining the direction of causality. Clearly,
since the number of participants in the present study was

Language proficiency and executive control
small, a replication of this study with a larger number
of participants would give further support to the results
and the conclusions. A larger sample would also make it
possible to avoid the use of American monolingual norms
in the L1 of the children, and generate bilingual norms
for this population, which the present study was unable
to do due to the wide age range. Such norms should
make it possible to determine whether the LLP children
have SLI. Finally, the present research was limited to
the bilingual population only, and can therefore present

897

only the relationship between language abilities and some
general executive function abilities in this population. It
does not explore the well-studied influence of the bilingual
situation on the generic executive function abilities. This
can only be tested in a study which, in addition to the
bilingual population, includes monolingual children with
TLD and monolingual children with SLI to create a more
complete picture regarding the relationships between
bilingualism, language proficiency and general executive
control.
