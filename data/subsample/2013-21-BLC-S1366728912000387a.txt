Many words have more than one translation across languages. Such TRANSLATION - AMBIGUOUS words are translated more
slowly and less accurately than their unambiguous counterparts. We examine the extent to which word context and
translation dominance influence the processing of translation-ambiguous words. We further examine how these factors
influence translation ambiguity stemming from two sources, specifically translation ambiguity derived from semantic
ambiguity and from near-synonymy. Bilingual participants were presented with English-German word pairs that were
preceded by a related or unrelated prime and were asked to decide if the word pairs were translations.
Translation-unambiguous pairs were recognized more quickly and accurately than translation-ambiguous pairs. Related
pairs and dominant translations were responded to more quickly than unrelated pairs and subordinate translations,
respectively. We discuss the results in relation to models of bilingual memory and propose a new model that makes specific
predictions about translation ambiguity, the Revised Hierarchical Model of Translation Ambiguity.

The process of translating a word often does not result
in a simple one-to-one mapping between a word in the
first language (L1) and a corresponding translation in
the second language (L2). In fact, previous research on
English and Spanish, English and Dutch, and English and
German has demonstrated that many words have a one-tomany mapping (Eddington, Degani & Tokowicz, 2012a;
Prior, MacWhinney & Kroll, 2007; Tokowicz, Kroll, de
Groot & van Hell, 2002). This one-to-many mapping
between a source language and target language is referred
to as TRANSLATION AMBIGUITY.
One cause of translation ambiguity is near-synonymy
in the target language, as in the case of the word shy, which
has two equivalents in German: schuchtern and scheu.
Both of these correspond to the same meaning. Translation
ambiguity is also sometimes due to semantic ambiguity
within the source language. For example, the English word
odd means an uneven number and strange, and each of
these meanings can be translated into a distinct German
word (ungerade for the number sense and merkwurdig for

TRANSLATION - AMBIGUOUS WORDS and to the latter as
MEANING TRANSLATION - AMBIGUOUS WORDS .
Unlike translation-unambiguous words for which there
is only one possible translation, a speaker translating
a translation-ambiguous word could activate multiple
translations. This parallels within-language semantic
ambiguity, which occurs when a single word has multiple
meanings. Previous research on semantic ambiguity has
demonstrated that context is important in resolving
the meanings of ambiguous words (e.g., Duffy, Morris
& Rayner, 1988; Hogaboam & Perfetti, 1975; Onifer
& Swinney, 198l; Simpson, 1981). Additionally, other
factors such as the dominance of the meanings play a
significant role in meaning activation (e.g., Duffy et al.,
1988; Hogaboam & Perfetti, 1975). Further, meaning
dominance and context interact in lexical ambiguity
resolution such that the more dominant meaning may be
primed by either the dominant or subordinate context,
whereas the subordinate meaning typically is primed only
by the subordinate biasing context (Duffy et al., 1998;
Hogaboam & Perfetti, 1975).
More recently it has also been noted that the semantic
similarity between the various meanings of an ambiguous
word may influence lexical ambiguity resolution and
processing (Armstrong & Plaut, 2008; Azuma & Van
Orden, 1997; Klepousniotou, Titone & Romero, 2008;
Rodd, Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 2002). For example,
polysemous words, which have highly related senses (e.g.,
paper), are responded to more quickly in a lexical decision

task than unambiguous words and homonymous words
(e.g., bank), which are words with unrelated senses or
meanings (Armstrong & Plaut, 2008; Azuma & Van
Orden, 1997; Rodd et al., 2002).
Because context, meaning frequency, and semantic
similarity all play a role in processing ambiguous words
within a language, these factors may also influence
processing translation-ambiguous words across two
languages (e.g., Degani & Tokowicz, 2010b). Research to
date has shown that out of context, translation-ambiguous
words are translated more slowly and less accurately than
translation-unambiguous words (Degani & Tokowicz,
2010a; Tokowicz & Kroll, 2007). Degani and Tokowicz
(2010a) further demonstrated that the translationambiguity disadvantage is not simply due to ambiguous
words being experienced less frequently because the
disadvantage persisted even though they matched the
token frequency of ambiguous and unambiguous words
precisely in a learning paradigm.
This research has provided important insights into
how these words affect processing by individuals at
varying levels of proficiency ranging from beginning
adult L2 learners (e.g., Degani & Tokowicz, 2010a)
to highly-proficient bilinguals (e.g., Boada, SanchezCasas, Gavilan, Garcia-Albea & Tokowicz, in press; see
Tokowicz & Degani, 2010, for discussion of the potential
changes in translation ambiguity effects that may occur
with increased proficiency).1 However, examining how
other factors such as dominance and context influence
the processing of these words is critical to gaining a
more complete understanding of the lexical and semantic
representations of these words in the bilingual mind.
Yet, to date, only a limited number of research studies
have examined these factors directly (Elston-Guttler
& Friederici, 2005; Elston-Guttler, Paulmann & Kotz,
2005; Elston-Guttler & Williams, 2008; Frenck-Mestre
& Prince, 1997; Laxen & Lavaur, 2010).
Laxen and Lavaur (2010, Experiment 3) used a
translation recognition task to examine how translation
dominance and the semantic similarity between the
translations of translation-ambiguous words affect
translation recognition. The translation-ambiguous words
that had less semantically similar translations (meaning
translation-ambiguous words) were responded to more
slowly overall compared to words with more semantically
similar translations (synonym translation-ambiguous
words) and to unambiguous words. Additionally,
dominant translations were responded to more quickly
than subordinate translations, and the dominance effect
was greater for words with less semantically similar
translations than for words with more semantically similar

they began learning L2.

translations. The authors suggested that this was due
to greater shared representations at the semantic level
of representation in memory for the more semantically
similar translation-ambiguous words. Nevertheless, this
study examined only bilinguals' decisions on translationambiguous words out of context, where ambiguity effects
may be exaggerated in comparison to effects in context.
A study by Elston-Guttler et al. (2005, Experiment 2)
compared how less and more proficient German-English
bilinguals processed homonyms in a sentence context.
They also examined the effects of dominance of the
homonyms' meanings captured by the English translations
(e.g., the German word Kiefer means both jaw and pine in
German). In the experiment, a sentence biased one meaning of the homonymous word (e.g., jaw), which served
as the prime. The prime appeared in the final position
of the sentence. After a delay, the target word, which
corresponded to the other sense of the homonym (e.g.,
pine), was presented. Then, participants made a lexical
decision to the target word. There were two conditions: (i)
a sentence that biased the dominant meaning of the word
(e.g., "The sticky candy stuck together his jaw") with a target that represented the subordinate meaning (e.g., pine),
and (ii) a sentence that biased the subordinate meaning
(e.g., "The beautiful table was made of solid pine"), with
a target that represented the dominant meaning (e.g., jaw).
Dominant targets were responded to more quickly than
the subordinate targets, demonstrating dominance effects
across translated senses of semantically-related words.
A study by Elston-Guttler and Williams (2008)
examined how German learners of English process
translation-ambiguous words within sentential context.
They used polysemous German words such as Blase,
which translates to both blister and bubble. Participants
read a sentence and decided whether the final word made
sense in the context. The German learners of English
responded more slowly to the polysemous translations
that biased the alternative sense (e.g., "His shoes were
uncomfortable due to a bubble") than to the same words
in control sentences (e.g., "She was very hungry because
of a bubble"). These findings suggest that all meanings
of the ambiguous word were activated, thereby leading to
the interference effect. Because this interference effect
appeared even though only one translated sense was
presented, it suggests that on viewing the English word
form (bubble) the bilinguals activated the German word
form (Blasen), which in turn activated both meanings
and corresponding translations (bubble and blister) (but
see Degani, Prior & Tokowicz, 2010, for an alternative
explanation).
Although Elston-Guttler and Williams (2008) showed
that both meanings of a polysemous word are activated
even in biasing context, they did not directly examine
the role of translation dominance, which may also
influence these effects. Dominance influences ambiguous

word processing (Elston-Guttler et al., 2005; Laxen
& Lavaur, 2010) as does semantic similarity between
the translations (Laxen & Lavaur, 2010), and these
factors may interact with each other. The current study
examines these three factors: word context, semantic
similarity/source of translation ambiguity, and translation
dominance/frequency.2 Thus, this study provides an
investigation of how each of these elements affects
processing of translation-ambiguous words, and how these
factors interact with one another, within a word translation
recognition task.
Despite the fact that translation ambiguity consistently
affects processing, the majority of bilingual models (e.g.,
Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002; Jacquet & French, 2002)
have not been adapted to take translation ambiguity effects
into consideration. One such adaptation was presented
by Laxen and Lavaur (2010), who described a modified
version of the Distributed Conceptual Feature Model
(DCFM; de Groot, 1992; van Hell & de Groot, 1998) to
explain their findings. According to the original DCFM,
a word's semantic information is distributed across nodes
in a shared (L1/L2) semantic level of representation. The
speed and accuracy of translating a word is influenced
by how many shared nodes there are between a word
in L1 and its corresponding translation in L2. Concrete

Translation dominance and translation frequency are highly related
constructs (e.g., Prior, Wintner, MacWhinney & Lavie, 2011) that
will not be disentangled here.

words and cognate translations are thought to share
more nodes at the semantic level across languages than
abstract words and noncognate translations, respectively.
Specifically, the DCFM predicts that the greater the
number of shared nodes between the L1 and L2, the
faster and more accurate processing will be. The model
therefore provides an explanation of why concrete words
and cognates are translated more quickly and accurately
than abstract words and noncognates, respectively (e.g.,
de Groot, 1992; van Hell & de Groot, 1998; see also
Schoonbaert, Duyck, Brysbaert & Hartsuiker, 2009, for
a similar explanation within the context of translation
priming). Laxen and Lavaur's (2010) extension of the
DCFM included translation-ambiguous words so that
more than one translation could be selected at the lexical
level of representation. According to this model, the
more semantically similar the possible translations are (as
for synonym translation-ambiguous words), the greater
the number of shared nodes will be active, leading to
faster processing (see Figure 1a). When translations are
less semantically similar (as for meaning translationambiguous words) there will be less shared activation at
the semantic level and therefore processing will be slower
(see Figure 1b).
The Revised Hierarchal Model (RHM; Kroll &
Stewart, 1994) has also been extended to include
translation ambiguity (Kroll & Tokowicz, 2001; see
Figure 2). The original RHM makes two key assumptions.
First, bilinguals have stronger lexical links from L2 words

English-German translation ambiguity

Tokowicz, 2001).

to their translations in L1 than the reverse. Second,
there are stronger bidirectional links between concepts
and corresponding words in L1 than between concepts
and corresponding words in L2. As a result of these
asymmetries, translation from L2 to L1 is thought to be
mediated via lexical associations. By contrast, translation
from L1 to L2 is conceptually mediated, such that access
to the translation is through concepts or meanings (from
the L1 word, to the concept, to the L2 word).
Kroll and Tokowicz (2001) modified the RHM
to include translation-ambiguous words, but did not
distinguish synonym and meaning translation-ambiguous
words. Here, we incorporate these two elements into
the RHM and refer to the adapted model as the
R EVISED H IERARCHICAL M ODEL OF T RANSLATION

445

A MBIGUITY (RHM-TA). The RHM-TA predicts different
outcomes for translation-ambiguous words derived
from different sources (synonym vs. meaning). In
Figure 3, we portray this model indicating translation
ambiguity in the L1 to L2 direction. For synonym
translation-ambiguous words, there is a single L1 lexical
representation and a single conceptual representation,
but this conceptual representation is connected to
multiple L2 lexical representations (see Figure 3a). For
meaning translation-ambiguous words, there is again
a single L1 lexical representation, but more than one
conceptual representation; each conceptual representation
is connected to a different L2 lexical representation
(see Figure 3b). Additionally, for meaning translationambiguous words with one highly dominant translation,
there would be a stronger connections to the concept
for the dominant meaning and to the L2 lexicon for
the dominant translation; here, we make the simplifying
assumption that the dominant translation across languages
corresponds to the dominant meaning within a language,
although this may not necessarily be the case because the
meaning distribution experienced in L1 will not precisely
mirror that in L2.
Based on prior research (e.g. Elston-Guttler et al.,
2005; Frenck-Mestre & Prince, 1997; Laxen & Lavaur,
2010) and the RHM-TA framework, we predict that
dominant translations will be processed more quickly than
subordinate translations. Furthermore, once the meaning
is established for meaning translation-ambiguous words,
there will be a more one-to-one connection from the L1
word to the L2 word via concepts. This is because the
ambiguity for meaning translation-ambiguous words is
due to the multiple connections from the L1 lexical level
to the conceptual level, but there is a direct mapping from

a single concept to a single word from the conceptual level
to the L2 lexical level. For example, if the context biased
the strange sense of the word odd then the only possible
translation would be merkwurdig. In contrast, a context
for the word fruit would not limit the possible translations
available to a single translation in German; Obst and
Frucht would both remain options. Therefore, meaning
translation-ambiguous words may have an advantage
over synonym translation-ambiguous words in tasks that
establish some form of context because the latter will
maintain a one-to-many mapping regardless of context.
Consistent with this idea, Degani and Tokowicz (2010a)
found that when teaching monolinguals translationunambiguous and ambiguous Dutch words, the meaning
translation-ambiguous words were learned more easily
than synonym translation-ambiguous words.
Because in this experiment we directly compare two
sources of translation ambiguity in a categorical rather
than continuous manner, we chose to demonstrate these
two types of ambiguity in the RHM-TA in a more localized
fashion. However, this representation may be oversimplified. Instead, this model could be adapted to have a more
distributed representation as in the DCFM. For example,
polysemous translation-ambiguous words in which the
translations are more highly related, the meanings at the
conceptual level would overlap to a higher degree.
The goals of the current study are: (i) to better understand how L2 learners process translation-ambiguous
words; (ii) to understand how word context, semantic
relatedness, and dominance of the translations interact
with processing of these words; and (iii) to examine
whether word context can disambiguate translationambiguous words. We therefore examined differences
between the processing of the synonym vs. meaning types
of translation-ambiguous words compared to translationunambiguous words, as well as the differences in
processing for dominant and subordinate translations.
Because the semantic similarity between different senses
of ambiguous words influences processing within a
language (Armstrong & Plaut, 2008; Azuma & Van
Orden, 1997; Rodd et al., 2002), in a post-hoc analysis
we also examined how the perceived semantic similarity
between the multiple translations of the translationambiguous words correlates with processing speed.
To examine these issues, we developed a modification
of the TRANSLATION RECOGNITION TASK (e.g. de Groot
& Comijs, 1995), which we have termed the PRIMED
TRANSLATION RECOGNITION TASK . In this task, bilinguals
decide if pairs of words are correct translations; the
word pairs are preceded by an unrelated or related prime
word. We focused our analyses on the correct translation
pairs that were preceded by unrelated vs. related primes;
faster reaction times on related than unrelated trials was
taken to indicate priming. Initially, we were additionally
interested in how the matching of the related prime to the

meaning of the translation, for the meaning translationambiguous items (e.g., a prime that matched the dominant
translation paired with that dominant translation vs. paired
with the subordinate translation) may affect processing.
However, the manipulation of prime match (match RT:
1259 ms vs. mismatch RT: 1248 ms) did not yield any
significant effects, F < 1. Therefore, we examine only the
effects of primes that matched the translation meaning and
excluded data from trials on which mismatched primes
were presented.
Based on the findings of previous studies (e.g.,
Tokowicz & Kroll, 2007) and the RHM-TA, we predicted
an overall ambiguity disadvantage such that translationambiguous words (e.g., trunk) would be responded to
more slowly and less accurately than unambiguous
words (e.g., art). Based on previous semantic priming
studies (see Neely, 1991, for a review), we expected
target-translation pairs preceded by related primes (e.g.,
prime: design; target-translation: ART-Kunst) to result
in faster response times than target-translation pairs
preceded by unrelated primes (e.g., prime: fiscal; target-
translation: ART-Kunst). In line with the RHM-TA, we
also predicted that related primes would disambiguate
meaning translation-ambiguous words (e.g., prime: paper;
target-translation: SHEET-Blatt) and make them easier
to process, such that response times for semantically
primed meaning translation-ambiguous words would be
similar to primed translation-unambiguous words. Based
on previous studies within a language (Duffy et al., 1998;
Hogaboam & Perfetti, 1975) and across languages (Laxen
& Lavaur, 2010) we predicted further that dominant
translations (e.g., SHY-schuchtern) would result in
faster response times than subordinate translations
(e.g., SHY-scheu) for both synonym and meaning
translation-ambiguous words. We expected that synonym
translation-ambiguous words would be responded to
more quickly overall than meaning-translation ambiguous
words based on the predictions of the modified DCFM
and previous research (Laxen & Lavaur, 2010). Lastly,
based on the RHM-TA, we expected a translation
ambiguity type by relatedness interaction such that
related primes would facilitate translation-recognition
speed more for meaning translation-ambiguous words
than for synonym translation-ambiguous words. This is
because a related prime could disambiguate the meaningtranslation ambiguous word by restricting the selection to
one translation but should not disambiguate a synonym
translation-ambiguous word.

Task order
Following two tasks that did not yield interesting
findings, participants completed the primed translation
recognition task.3 Lastly, participants completed a
language history questionnaire (Tokowicz, Michael &
Kroll, 2004) that details their demographic information,
previous language exposure, and self-reported ratings
of L1 and L2 proficiency. Additionally, a subset of
participants completed form (spelling and sound) and
meaning similarity ratings for the German translations
of the translation-ambiguous English words.
3

Specifically, participants first completed an operation-span task
(Turner & Engle, 1989), which evaluated their working memory;
due to missing data we will not report results from this task. Next,
participants completed a picture-naming task intended to assess
relative L2 proficiency. Because of overall low accuracy (48%) on
this relatively difficult production task, we did not consider these data
further.

Participants
Data were analyzed from 26 native English-speaking
participants from the University of Pittsburgh and
The Pennsylvania State University. An additional
17 participants took part in the study but did not contribute
data to the final analyses because they failed to reach
50% accuracy on all three word types in the translation
recognition task (unambiguous, meaning translationambiguous, and synonym translation-ambiguous words;
n = 7) or had exposure to a language other than English
before age 10 (n = 10). Participants included in the final
analyses had an overall mean accuracy of 85%. All but one
of the participants were right handed. Language history
questionnaire data are shown in Table 1.

Stimuli
The critical word stimuli consisted of 448 prime-target-
translation triplets (see Table 2 for example stimuli;

Materials accompanying this article online, via the

German word frequencies are the log of the SUBTLEX-DE word frequency norms (Brysbaert et al., 2011). Form similarity ratings between the
English and German word pairs were computed using the normalized for word length Levenshtein metric as described in Schepens et al. (2012).

The critical target words consisted of 32 translationunambiguous words, 32 meaning translation-ambiguous
words, 32 synonym translation-ambiguous words, and
92 filler targets. Translations and their dominance
were obtained from English-German/German-English
number-of-translations norms obtained by Eddington
et al. (2012a), who used the same method to elicit and
code translations as Tokowicz et al. (2002). Specifically,
individuals provided the first translation they thought of
for each word, and the number of correct translations
across individuals was used to determine translation
ambiguity. Words were considered translation ambiguous
if they elicited two or more German translations and
translation unambiguous if they elicited a single German
translation. The most frequently provided translation was
considered the dominant translation. Using dictionaries
(Biographisches Institut GmbH, 2012; LEO GmbH,
2012), we classified words as synonym translation
ambiguous if they had German translations with similar
senses; we classified words as meaning translation
ambiguous if they had German translations with dissimilar
meanings.4
For each critical target, there was a corresponding
related and unrelated prime. All translation-ambiguous
targets (meaning and synonym types) had two

corresponding translations. For the meaning-ambiguous
targets, there were related and unrelated primes
that corresponded to each distinct meaning/translation.
However, because the synonym translation-ambiguous
targets essentially only have one meaning (although
there may be slight differences in usage of the words)
there was only one related and unrelated prime for each
target. Translation-unambiguous targets were paired with
a single translation and also had one related and unrelated
prime. Prime and target pairs had been normed previously
for relatedness by a group of native English speakers
(Eddington, 2009). Stimulus characteristics by condition
are given in Table 3, prime characteristics are given in
Table 4, and relatedness ratings are given in Table 5.
However, because of the limited selection of items
there were some differences in word characteristics of
the prime-target-translation triplets across conditions.
Item characteristic differences were regressed out of the
analyses by items. We address these differences further in
the results section.
The conditions were counterbalanced across list
versions such that each target word was presented only
once to each participant. All the critical targets were paired
with their corresponding correct translation and therefore
constituted "yes" trials. The filler targets consisted of
targets paired with incorrect translations and therefore
constituted "no" trials. There were equal numbers of
related and unrelated primes paired with the filler and

Note: Semantic similarity ratings were based on a scale from 1-7 on
which 1 indicates that the two words are highly unrelated and 7 indicates
that the words are highly related. These ratings were obtained from
Eddington (2009). Twenty-four participants rated prime-target pairs for
relatedness. There were two related and unrelated primes that correspond
to each distinct meaning for the meaning translation-ambiguous target
words. Only one related and unrelated pair was presented for the filler,
unambiguous, and synonym translation-ambiguous targets.

critical targets within each list. Data from only the "yes"
trials were analyzed.
Procedure
In the primed translation recognition task, participants
were asked to decide if English-German word pairs were
translation equivalents. Each English-German pair was
preceded by a related or unrelated prime. Participants
first saw a fixation cross for 1000 ms, then a prime for
250 ms, followed immediately by a target-translation pair.
Participants had up to 3500 ms to respond using a button
box (leftmost key for "no" and rightmost key for "yes").
Participants had four breaks during the task to rest their
eyes. The E-prime software package (Schneider, Eschman
& Zuccolotto, 2010) was used to present the stimuli and
to record reaction time (RT) and accuracy.
Results
Data trimming
One word was removed from the data analysis because
it was mislabeled as being a synonym type rather than
meaning type ambiguous word.5 Following this, response
latencies that were shorter than 300 ms or longer than
3000 ms, and all response latencies 2.5 standard deviations
above or below each participant's mean were excluded
from analyses. These procedures led to the removal of
3.32% of the data.

We could not recode the mislabeled item as a meaning translationambiguous word because the meaning translation-ambiguous targets
were paired with two related and unrelated primes that corresponded
to the different translated meanings.

Analysis approach
We conducted three sets of analyses to examine different
aspects of our results. We first explored overall ambiguity
effects with 2 word type (ambiguous vs. unambiguous)
by 2 prime relatedness (related vs. unrelated) ANOVAs.
We then investigated word type effects using 3 word type
(synonym, meaning, unambiguous) by 2 prime relatedness
(related vs. unrelated) ANOVAs. Finally, we investigated
translation dominance effects using 2 ambiguity type
(synonym vs. meaning) by 2 translation dominance
(dominant vs. subordinate) by 2 prime relatedness (related
vs. unrelated) ANOVAs. Mean RT and accuracy data are
analyzed by participants (F1 ) and by items (F2 ).
To assess the matching of prime, target, and translation
characteristics across conditions, we examined: word
length; log SUBTL English word frequency (per million
words; Brysbaert & New, 2009) for primes and targets;
log SUBTLEX-DE German word frequency (per million
words; Brysbaert, Buchmeier, Conrad, Jacobs, Bolte &
Bohl, 2011) for translations; prime and target orthographic
neighborhood sizes; and target-translation form similarity
(Schepens, Dijkstra & Grootjen, 2012) in three analyses.
These three analyses are congruent with our three sets of
primary participant and items analyses. Any factor that
differed across conditions in main effects or interactions
using a conservative alpha level of .15 was regressed out
of the item RT and accuracy data; the saved residual values
were treated as the dependent measures in the analyses by
items (see Table 6).6
Analyses
To examine overall ambiguity effects, both meaning
and synonym type translation-ambiguous words were
collapsed in 2 word type (ambiguous vs. unambiguous)
by 2 prime relatedness (related vs. unrelated) repeated
measures ANOVAs (see means in Table 7).
Overall, translation-ambiguous words were recognized
more slowly (1284 vs. 1017 ms) (F1 (1,25) = 173.93,
MSE = 10645.95, p < .001; F2 (1,298) = 21.46, MSE =

The first item characteristic analysis used a 2 ambiguity (ambiguous,
unambiguous) by 2 relatedness (related, unrelated) ANOVA. Based
on this analysis, we removed the effects of translation length, target
frequency, and translation frequency from the item analyses. The
second item characteristic analysis used a 3 word type (synonym,
meaning, unambiguous) by 2 relatedness (related, unrelated) ANOVA.
Based on this analysis, we removed the effects of target and
translation length, target, prime, and translation frequency, and target
orthographic neighborhood from the item analyses. The third item
characteristic analysis included only ambiguous words and used a
2 word type (synonym, meaning) by 2 translation dominance
(dominant, subordinate) by 2 relatedness (related, unrelated) ANOVA.
Based on this analysis, we removed the effects of target and translation
length, target and prime frequency, target and prime orthographic
neighborhood, and form similarity from the item analyses. The full
details of these analyses are provided in Table 6.

F2 (1,310) = 16.89, MSE = 0.061, p < .001) than
translation-unambiguous words.7 Target-translation pairs
that were preceded by related primes were responded to
more quickly than target-translation pairs preceded by
unrelated primes (1119 vs. 1182 ms), F1 (1,25) = 11.88,
MSE = 8714.16, p < .01; F2 (1,298) = 5.85, MSE =

Ambiguous translations may be experienced less often than
unambiguous translations. To rule out the possibility that this
difference was responsible for our findings, we conducted a post-hoc
item analysis on a subset of 30 ambiguous and 25 unambiguous words.
In this subset, the ambiguous items were significantly more frequent
than the unambiguous items (3.96 vs. 2.68, log SUBTL), F(1,53) =
258.14, p < .001. We then tested the effects of ambiguity for this
subset of the items using a 2 (ambiguity) by 2 (relatedness) ANOVA.
The results demonstrate that the translation-ambiguity disadvantage in
both reaction time (F(1,51) = 12.66, p = .001) and accuracy (F(1,51)
= 4.966, p = .03) persists despite the fact that the ambiguous words
are more frequent than the unambiguous words. This finding, along
with previous research (Degani & Tokowicz, 2010a), suggests that
our results are not simply due to a difference in word frequency.

translation-ambiguous words were recognized more
slowly (Msynonym = 1284 ms, Mmeaning = 1268 ms,
Munambiguous = 1017 ms) (F1 (2,50) = 54.45, MSE =
21902.58, p < .001; F2 (1,292) = 9.90, MSE = 69052.70, p
< .001) and less accurately than translation-unambiguous
words (Msynonym = 79%, Mmeaning = 75%, Munambiguous
= 94%), F1 (2,50) = 41.21, MSE = 0.012, p < .001;
F2 (1,304) = 9.34, MSE = 0.061, p < .001. Examination of
the 95% confidence intervals for RT and accuracy revealed
that the means for the form and meaning ambiguous
words were similar, and were both different than those
for the translation-unambiguous words. Also, processing
was faster following related than unrelated primes (1151
vs. 1228 ms) (F1 (1,25) = 12.23, MSE = 18920.18, p
= .002; F2 (1,292) = 8.85, MSE = 69052.70, p < .01),
however this priming effect was not significant in the
accuracy analyses, F1 (1,25) = 1.83, MSE = 0.024, p =
.189; F2 (1,304) = 1.15, MSE = 0.061, p = .29. Word type
and relatedness did not interact in either analysis, for RT:
F1 (2,50) = 1.18, MSE = 16162.06, p = . 316; F2 < 1; for
accuracy: Fs < 1.
In the following analyses, we directly compare the
ambiguous word types and the differing effects of priming
and dominance on synonym and meaning translationambiguous words. To accomplish this, we tested only
the translation-ambiguous words, and used 2 ambiguity

the mean.
We observed no RT differences between the
meaning translation-ambiguous words and the synonym
translation-ambiguous words (1285 vs. 1274 ms), F1 < 1;
F2 (1,231) = 1.14, MSE = 78548.17, p = .286. However,
synonym translation-ambiguous words were responded to
marginally more accurately than the meaning translationambiguous words (79 vs. 74%), F1 (1,25) = 3.21, MSE
= 0.035, p = .085; F2 (1,243) = 3.35, MSE = 0.069,
p = .069. Dominant translations were responded to
more quickly than subordinate translations in the analysis
by participants (1246 vs. 1314 ms) (F1 (1,25) = 9.19,
MSE = 26325.51, p < .01), but not in the analysis
by items, F2 (1,231) = 1.13, MSE = 78548.17, p =

more accurately than subordinate translations (83 vs.

F2 (1,243) = 14.23, MSE = 0.069, p < .001. Target-
translation pairs preceded by related primes were
responded to more quickly than target-translation pairs
preceded by unrelated primes (1232 vs. 1327 ms),
F1 (1,25) = 8.21, MSE = 56754.05, p = .008;
F2 (1,231) = 7.41, MSE = 78548.17, p = .007. There
was no significant relatedness effect in the accuracy
analyses, F1 (1,25) = 1.70, MSE = 0.072, p = .204;
F2 (1,243) = 1.67, MSE = 0.069, p = .197. The interaction
between type and dominance was not significant by
participants or items in the reaction time analyses,
F1 < 1; F2 (1,231) = 2.64, MSE = 78548.17, p =
.106. We did observe a significant type by dominance
interaction in the accuracy analysis by participants,
F1 (1,25) = 6.23, MSE = 0.033, p = .02, which was
marginally significant by items, F2 (1,243) = 3.19, MSE =
0.069, p = .075. To gain a better understanding of
the significant interaction for the accuracy analysis,
we conducted Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests
(value to reach significance = .0125), which revealed
that the effect of translation dominance was greater
for meaning translation-ambiguous words (Mdominant =
84%, Msubordinate = 64%), t(25) = 5.23, p < .001, d =
1.35, than for the synonym translation-ambiguous words
(Mdominant = 82%, Msubordinate = 76%), t(25) = 2.39,
p = .025, d = 0.44. Additionally, there was no significant
difference between dominant translations for the meaning
and synonym translation-ambiguous words, t(25) =
0.602, p = .55, d = 0.08, but there was a significant
difference between the subordinate translations for the
synonym and meaning translation-ambiguous words
such that subordinate synonym translation-ambiguous
words had a higher accuracy than subordinate meaning
translation-ambiguous words (76 vs. 64 %), t(25) = 2.86,
p = .009, d = 0.84.
No ambiguity type by relatedness interaction was
observed in the RT and accuracy analyses, Fs < 1.

Although only significant interactions are typically probed
further, the RHM-TA makes specific predictions regarding
differences in priming for the two types of ambiguous
words. Therefore, we conducted planned t-tests (using
the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons;
critical value to reach significance = .025) examining
the RT priming effects for synonym and meaning
translation-ambiguous words. These revealed significant
priming for meaning translation-ambiguous words
(Mrelated = 1215 ms, Munrelated = 1333 ms), t(25) = 2.67,
p = .013, d = 0.42, but not for synonym translationambiguous words (Mrelated = 1250 ms, Munrelated = 1321
ms), t(25) = 1.91, p = .068, d = 0.24. Again, because
the interaction between ambiguity type and relatedness
was not statistically significant, these findings must be
interpreted with caution. No dominance by relatedness
interaction or three way interactions were observed.
Discussion
The focus of this experiment was to explore how the
processing of translation-ambiguous words is influenced
by word context, translation dominance, and translation
ambiguity type in a primed translation recognition task.
Consistent with our hypotheses and previous research
(e.g., Boada et al., in press; Degani & Tokowicz,
2010a; Laxen & Lavaur, 2010; Tokowicz & Kroll,
2007) we found an overall ambiguity disadvantage.
Participants were slower and less accurate to respond
to words that had more than one translation compared
to unambiguous words. Our hypothesis that dominant
translations would be recognized more quickly than
subordinate translations was confirmed only in our
analyses by participants. After accounting for potential
confounding factors in the analysis by items, this
hypothesis was not upheld, and the results were only
marginally significant. However, we did observe that
dominant translations were responded to more accurately
than subordinate translations. Additionally, we did not
observe any overall differences between the synonym and
meaning translation-ambiguous words. Consistent with
previous research (Laxen & Lavaur, 2010), we found a
marginally-significant interaction between ambiguity type
and translation dominance in accuracy, such that there was
a greater benefit for the dominant translation compared
to the subordinate translation for meaning translationambiguous words but not for synonym translationambiguous words.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to employ
the primed translation recognition methodology. We
demonstrated that a related prime can facilitate translation
recognition speed compared to an unrelated prime, thus
validating the primed translation recognition task. In the
following sections first we will discuss the theoretical
implications of the overall ambiguity effects, and then

English-German translation ambiguity
how bilingual models could account for the influence
of context, dominance, and semantic similarity on
processing of translation-ambiguous words.
Translation ambiguity effects
The source of translation ambiguity effects has yet to
be determined, although there are theoretical accounts
that provide some insights. The FAN EFFECT (Anderson,
1974) is the notion that the more ideas associated with
a concept, the greater the processing time will be on
the concept. For example, a word with many associates
would have smaller association strengths between the
concept and each association, whereas a word with only
one associate would have strong association strength
between the concept and the associate. Applying this
account to translation ambiguity generally, as the number
of translations increases, the associative strength between
a source word and each of its translations would
decrease (e.g., Degani & Tokowicz, 2010a). Translationunambiguous word pairs would therefore have the
strongest associative strength, leading to facilitation in
processing, whereas translation ambiguous words would
have weaker associations between a source word and each
translation, resulting in longer, more difficult processing
(e.g., Degani & Tokowicz, 2010a).
The difficulty found with translation-ambiguous words
can also be explained by Interactive Activation (IA)
models (e.g., Jacquet & French, 2002; McClelland &
Rumelhart, 1981) in which the effects would be due to
competition between the translations that correspond to
one word (Degani & Tokowicz, 2010a). For translationambiguous words, more than one alternative translation
is available for selection, which may lead to active
competition between the possible translations. Selecting
one translation over another would require the inhibition
of the unselected translation alternatives, leading to
slower and less accurate responses, particularly in
translation production tasks. Moreover, Elston-Guttler
et al. (2005) found evidence consistent with inhibition
of the unintended translation in the ERP record and RT
data for low proficiency native German-speaking learners
of English. Additionally, within the framework of an IA
model, one could explain dominance effects by adjusting
inhibitory connections such that there would be greater
inhibition for subordinate than dominant translations.
Although both theories can explain translation-ambiguity
effects, the underlying mechanisms driving the effects
are different. Furthermore, it is not clear how other
factors such as concreteness, cognate status, and source
of ambiguity would be incorporated in these two accounts
and therefore we are not able to distinguish which theory
may best capture our translation-ambiguity effects. It must
also be noted that these models may not accurately reflect
more complex translation situations such as discourse

453

translation. When a bilingual translates ambiguous words
out of context, they may be more influenced by the level
of ambiguity than when processing in a richer semantic
context. For example, a bilingual translating words
embedded in a discourse context may be less influenced by
ambiguity (but see Prior, Wintner, MacWhinney & Lavie,
2011).
Word context
One goal of the present study was to examine if
word context would reduce the translation-ambiguity
disadvantage in processing. We observed an overall
priming effect suggesting that translation recognition can
indeed be facilitated with a simple word context. However,
priming was not equivalent across word types. Although
the interaction between word type and relatedness did
not reach statistical significance, results from planned ttests revealed significant priming for meaning translationambiguous words, but no significant priming for the
synonym translation-ambiguous words; because the
interaction was not statistically significant, this finding
must be interpreted cautiously. Further, despite an overall
priming effect for translation-ambiguous words, this
effect was not strong enough to completely eliminate
the translation-ambiguity disadvantage. This is made
evident by the fact that the mean RTs for primed
translation-ambiguous words were still slower than those
for translation-unambiguous words. It may be that a
simple word context is insufficient to aid in the processing
difficulties of translation-ambiguous words. Future work
should evaluate how richer contexts affect processing
of translation-ambiguous words. Perhaps sentential and
discourse contexts may provide greater information
to allow the bilingual or L2 learner to narrow the
selection of the appropriate target word. Studies on
simultaneous translators/interpreters have noted that the
rich context provided during simultaneous interpreting
(e.g., at conferences) benefit the translator greatly; not
only does the source language guide the translator's output
in the target language, but the overall context of the
environment does as well (Setton, 2006).
Dominance
The dominance effect we observed in the analysis by
participants is consistent with several within-language
(e.g., Duffy et al., 1988; Hogaboam & Perfetti, 1975) and
cross-language studies (e.g., Elston-Guttler et al., 2005;
Frenck-Mestre & Prince, 1997; Laxen & Lavaur, 2010).
These results are also in line with the modified DCFM
(Laxen & Lavaur, 2010) in which dominant translations
share more semantic nodes between the L1 and L2
compared to subordinate translations, thus facilitating
translation recognition. In this framework, the number

454

Chelsea M. Eddington and Natasha Tokowicz

of shared nodes is taken to indicate the relative amount
of semantic similarity. However, we did not observe a
significant dominance effect in RT after regressing out
potential confounding factors. However, the dominance
effect in the accuracy analyses remained even after
accounting for potentially confounding factors. Thus,
dominance effects here may reflect greater knowledge of
the dominant translation as can been seen in the accuracy
results.
Translation ambiguity type
We did not observe any differences between the two
types of ambiguous words on mean translation recognition
latency, but did observe differences in accuracy such that
meaning translation-ambiguous words were responded
to marginally less accurately than synonym translationambiguous words. We also found an interaction
between dominance and ambiguity type in accuracy
suggesting that translation dominance affected meaning
translation-ambiguous words to a greater extent than
synonym translation-ambiguous words. The interaction
of ambiguity type and dominance is predicted by the
modified DCFM (Laxen & Lavaur, 2010). For synonym
translation-ambiguous words, the subordinate translation
is semantically similar to the dominant translation. Thus,
the set of features that becomes activated will not help to
disambiguate the translation because both the dominant
and subordinate translations will become active. This
would reduce the effects of dominance on translation
recognition for these words. For the meaning translationambiguous words, the translations are less semantically
similar, so fewer shared semantic features would be active,
and different features would be active for the dominant
vs. subordinate translation. The dominant translation
would have a greater number of representations shared
between the L1 and L2 and thus dominant translations
would be responded to more quickly and accurately than
subordinate translations.
Following the same logic, the adapted DCFM would
predict faster response times for synonym than meaning
translation-ambiguous words because there are more
shared semantic features for the former. However, we
found no differences between the two types. The lack
of a modulation by type of ambiguity in the presence
of an overall translation-ambiguity effect in the reaction
time analyses suggests that translation ambiguity slows
processing regardless of the source of ambiguity. It is also
possible that we observed different results from Laxen
and Lavaur (2010) because of the differences between
our tasks. In Laxen and Lavaur's study, participants
made responses to the translation, and the target word
served as the prime. In the current study, the participants'
responses were made to the target-translation pair with a
preceding word context. The addition of word context and

simultaneous presentation of the target-translation pair
may have slowed the responses, potentially influencing
the pattern of findings.
However, within words of each type of ambiguity there
is likely to be a range of similarity between the two
translations. To perform a post-hoc examination using a
more continuous measure of semantic similarity, we asked
a subset of the participants (n = 12) to complete form
(spelling and sound) and semantic similarity ratings of
the German translations that corresponded to the English
translation-ambiguous words (e.g., Tokowicz et al.,
2002).8 There were no significant differences between the
form similarity ratings of meaning translation-ambiguous
words (M = 1.89, SD = 1.17) and synonym translationambiguous words (M = 2.35, SD = 1.17), t(61) = 1.55,
p < .13. However, on average, the meaning translationambiguous words were rated as less SEMANTICALLY
similar (M = 3.07, SD = 1.21) than the synonym
translation-ambiguous words (M = 4.19, SD = 0.94),
t(61) = 4.10, p < .001. This range in perceived semantic
similarity may play a role in how bilinguals process
these words in a translation recognition task. Therefore,
we correlated the semantic similarity ratings and the
mean related and unrelated RTs; these were significantly
negatively correlated (related: r = -.255, p = .046;
unrelated: r = -.356, p < .004). It is possible that the
related RTs show a weaker correlation because facilitation
from the related prime made semantic similarity less
influential for primed target-translation pairs. These
correlations support the prediction of the DCFM. The
dichotomous categorization of words as meaning vs.
synonym translation ambiguous therefore may not best
capture the full range of semantic similarity between
the multiple translations (see Eddington, Degani &
Tokowicz, 2012b, for the related Translation Semantic
Variability measure). It is also possible that some words
that were initially categorized as meaning or synonym
translation-ambiguous words may be perceived as more
or less semantically similar than we expected. This
correlation should not be taken cautiously, however,
because these ratings were obtained by a small number
of participants who had just completed the translation
recognition task, and therefore their ratings may have been
biased. Additionally, the perceived semantic similarity
between the two words in one language may change
as a function of them sharing a translation in another
language (e.g., Degani, Prior & Tokowicz, 2011). It
is also important to note the distinction between the
semantic similarity between the shared translations and
8

Only a subset of participants completed the semantic similarity ratings
due to the limited time permitted (one hour) for testing participants
for credit toward their requirement. Therefore, only participants who
were paid for completing the task or participants who completed the
test battery in under an hour completed the ratings.

English-German translation ambiguity
the type of translation ambiguity. The semantic similarity
ratings capture only the similarity between the multiple
translations, which is suggestive but not diagnostic of
the source of translation ambiguity (within-language
synonymy, polysemy, or semantic ambiguity) in the
target language. Therefore, perceived semantic similarity
in addition to the source of ambiguity may influence
processing uniquely, but this has yet to be determined.
Nonetheless, future researchers should consider a more
continuous measure when examining the effects of
ambiguity in processing (Eddington et al., 2012b).
Examining the type of ambiguity allowed us to partially
disentangle within-language semantic ambiguity effects
from translation ambiguity effects. We predicted that
there would be differential priming effects on the various
word types such that priming would facilitate translation
recognition more for the meaning translation-ambiguous
words than the synonym translation-ambiguous words.
We expected this effect because a related prime for a
meaning translation-ambiguous word could restrict the
selection to one possible translation but would not restrict
selection to one possible translation for the synonym
translation-ambiguous words. We did not observe this
interaction. It is possible that the interaction was not
significant because of the large range in proficiency
of the participants. We did not collect information on
their knowledge of all the possible multiple translations
for the translation-ambiguous words and therefore some
of the less-proficient participants may have been less
aware of the alternative translations than the moreproficient participants. Future research would need to
address this issue by examining how proficiency plays
a role in these ambiguity effects. Nonetheless, planned
t-tests revealed that priming was significant only for
the meaning translation-ambiguous words. Furthermore,
the priming effect size for the meaning translationambiguous words was nearly double that of the synonym
translation-ambiguous words, suggesting that perhaps the
variability across individuals was responsible for the lack
of a significant interaction. The slowing in processing
for the meaning translation-ambiguous words relative
to translation-unambiguous words in part could be due
to the competition or increased number of associations
(i.e., a fan effect) between the multiple translations,
and/or it could be due to competing meanings of the
word. For example, the word trunk in English is both
semantically ambiguous and translation ambiguous from
English to German. An English-German bilingual may
have difficulty processing this word because there are
multiple meanings (e.g., tree sense, car sense) activated
and they may activate the corresponding translation for
those meanings (e.g., Baumstamm, Kofferraum).
Slowing in processing for synonym translationambiguous words could be influenced in part by the
potential competition of the multiple translations, but

455

not by semantic ambiguity because the words essentially
capture only one sense. In a production task, both
translations could compete for selection, but it appears
that even in a recognition task such as ours, in which only
one possible translation is presented to the bilinguals, the
alternative translation is still active, which may be the
source of the reduced priming for the synonym translationambiguous words. Thus, as the bilinguals made decisions
on the target-translation pairs, the prime related to the
meaning of the word could not fully restrict the activation
and selection of one translation over the other. Priming
for the meaning translation-ambiguous words suggests
that the prime may have narrowed the selection of
the potential translation. Alternatively, this narrowing of
translation possibilities may also have reduced the number
of associations leading also to a speedup in translation
recognition.
These effects are consistent with the RHM-TA, which
predicts that a cue to one sense of a meaning translationambiguous word would help to disambiguate the word.
The corresponding connection from the conceptual level
to the L2 lexical representation would then be more direct.
A semantic cue for synonym translation-ambiguous words
would still result in multiple connections from the
conceptual level to the L2 lexical level. However, we
must interpret these results with caution because they are
based on post-hoc analyses and the interaction between
word type and relatedness failed to reach significance.
Additionally, because there are often meaning nuances
between near-synonyms, a cue provided for one use of the
word may in fact also disambiguate a synonym translationambiguous word. Furthermore, the associative strength
of a prime could modulate ambiguity effects (Nievas,
Justicia, Canas & Bajo, 2005). Consequently, translation
ambiguity due to multiple sources (near-synonymy vs.
within-language semantic ambiguity) may be represented
and processed differently. Future research on translation
ambiguity would benefit from examining not only the
underlying source of the translation ambiguity but also
the semantic similarity between the shared translations.
Conclusion
Translation ambiguity is an influential phenomenon in
bilingual processing and L2 learning and processing.
Exactly how translation ambiguity is resolved has yet
to be elucidated. However, the current study reveals
that translation dominance, word context, and the source
of ambiguity affect processing of translation-ambiguous
words. Future research on translation ambiguity would
also benefit from examining how other factors such
as proficiency, direction of ambiguity, and semantic
similarity between translations influence processing. We
also provide a new methodology for use in examining
bilingual processing, the primed translation recognition
