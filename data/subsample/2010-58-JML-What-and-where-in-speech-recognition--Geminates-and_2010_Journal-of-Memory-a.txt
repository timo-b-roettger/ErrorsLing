Four cross-modal repetition priming experiments examined whether consonant duration
in Italian provides listeners with information not only for segmental identification (``what"
information: whether the consonant is a geminate or a singleton) but also for lexical segmentation (``where" information: whether the consonant is in word-initial or word-medial
position). Italian participants made visual lexical decisions to words containing geminates
or singletons, preceded by spoken primes (whole words or fragments) containing either
geminates or singletons. There were effects of segmental identity (geminates primed geminate recognition; singletons primed singleton recognition), and effects of consonant position (regression analyses revealed graded effects of geminate duration only for geminates
which can vary in position, and mixed-effect modeling revealed a positional effect for singletons only in low-frequency words). Durational information appeared to be more important for segmental identification than for lexical segmentation. These findings nevertheless
indicate that the same kind of information can serve both ``what" and ``where" functions in
speech comprehension, and that the perceptual processes underlying those functions are
interdependent.

Introduction
Successful spoken-word recognition depends in large
part on identification of the component segments of words
- the vowels and consonants that specify a word's identity.
The listener, however, needs not only to identify what segments there are in the current speech stream, but also
where they occur. Positional information indicating that a
segment may be word-initial, for example, can assist in
the segmentation of continuous speech into lexical units
by providing a signal about where a word boundary may
occur. In the present study, we examine the interdependencies between the perceptual processes responsible for

segmental ``what" and ``where" decisions, and ask in particular whether the same kind of acoustic information
can influence both of these processes.
Our focus is on consonant duration in Italian word recognition. In Italian, the opposition between geminates (long
consonants) and singletons (short consonants) is distinctive.
This contrast, primarily signaled by large differences in consonant duration, occurs between word-medial vowels. In
the pair fatto (``fact") and fato (``fate"), for example, the duration of the medial consonant distinguishes the two words.
The duration of Italian consonants also varies (but to a lesser
extent) as a function of their position in words. We ask here
whether Italians use consonant duration only to identify
geminates and singletons, as surely they must, or whether
they also use it to locate consonants. It could be that Italians
attend to the large differences between phoneme types in
order to make segmental ``what" decisions, and that they
ignore the small positional differences. Alternatively, they

L. Tagliapietra, J.M. McQueen / Journal of Memory and Language 63 (2010) 306-323

could use consonant durations for both ``what" and ``where"
decisions.
Segment identification is usually considered necessary
for word identification. In several models of spoken-word
recognition (e.g., TRACE, McClelland & Elman, 1986; Shortlist, Norris, 1994; Shortlist B, Norris & McQueen, 2008; the
Neighborhood Activation Model, Luce & Pisoni, 1998; PARSYN, Luce, Goldinger, Auer, & Vitevitch, 2000), segments
are recognized at a prelexical level of processing. In other
models (e.g., the Distributed Cohort Model (DCM), Gaskell
& Marslen-Wilson, 1997; MINERVA2, Goldinger, 1998; LAFS,
Klatt, 1979) there are no discrete representations for individual segments, but the acoustic-phonetic information
that specifies segmental identity nevertheless plays a central role in word recognition (e.g., via featural representations in the DCM). In any of these models, therefore, the
idea in the Italian consonant case would be that durational
information associated with singleton and geminate consonants is extracted from the speech signal and hence (in different ways in the different models) influences word
recognition.
Is Italian consonant duration used only for these ``what"
decisions, or is it also used in lexical segmentation, for
``where" decisions? In many accounts segmentation is a
by-product of the word-recognition process. Multiple candidate words are simultaneously active at any point in time,
and compete with each other (see McQueen (2007), for review). As this competition process settles on a lexical interpretation of a stretch of continuous speech, word boundaries
are ``found" between the words in the winning sequence
(McClelland & Elman, 1986; Norris, 1994). Segmentation is
also influenced by a wide variety of other sources of information, however. These information sources include metrical
(Cutler & Norris, 1988), phonotactic (McQueen, 1998), and
prosodic (Christophe, Peperkamp, Pallier, Block, & Mehler,
2004) cues to the location of likely word boundaries. The relative strength of different segmentation cues varies under
different listening conditions (Mattys, White, & Melhorn,
2005). According to Norris, McQueen, Cutler, and Butterfield
(1997), these cues influence the lexical competition process
through the operation of a Possible Word Constraint (PWC).
Candidate words that do not have a possible word (i.e., a vowel) between them and a likely word boundary are penalized in the activation/competition process. As elaborated
by Cho, McQueen, and Cox (2007), information relevant for
phonemic contrasts is used to specify segmental representations that serve word recognition, while, in parallel, a Prosody Analyzer uses suprasegmental information to
compute the prosodic structure of the current utterance.
Likely lexical boundary locations are part of this structure,
and, as in the original Norris et al. account, these boundaries
can influence segmentation through the operation of the
PWC. As Cho et al. (2007) point out, however, prosodic analysis cannot be completely separate from segmental analysis.
For instance, the prosodic evaluation of the duration of a segment must depend in part on identification of the segment
(because segments differ in their intrinsic duration).
Even though there must be these interdependencies between ``what" and ``where" processes, it is not the case that
information which is used in one process is necessarily used
in the other. Italian consonant duration offers an interesting

307

test of whether information used for identification is also
used for segmentation. Cross-linguistic evidence indicates
that listeners use fine-grained phonetic details to locate
the position of sounds in relation to prosodic boundaries.
American English listeners are sensitive to variations in
the strength with which segments are articulated at Intonational Phrase as opposed to word boundaries (Cho et al.,
2007), and to variation in consonant duration determined
by whether the consonants are word-initial or word-medial
(Gow & Gordon, 1995). Dutch listeners rely on durational
cues to distinguish sounds occurring in word-final vs.
word-initial position (Quene, 1992; Shatzman & McQueen,
2006). French and Italian listeners are sensitive to subtle differences among segments that are dependent on syllabification (Finocchiaro & Bertinetto, 2003; Spinelli, McQueen, &
Cutler, 2003; Tabossi, Collina, Mazzetti, & Zoppello, 2000).
According to the account of Cho et al. (2007), all of these
sources of information about segment duration (along with
other cues to prosodic structure, Christophe et al., 2004;
Salverda, Dahan, & McQueen, 2003) are processed by the
Prosody Analyzer, and hence used to signal the location of
likely word boundaries. In spite of this evidence, it is possible
that consonant duration in Italian could influence segmental
identification only. This is because, as we now discuss, consonant duration in Italian has greater informational value as
a segmental cue than as a positional cue.
In Italian, the opposition between 15 geminates (/p/, /b/,
/t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, /a/, /F/, /m/, /n/, /r/, /f/, /v/, /s/, /l/) and their
singleton counterparts is phonemic (Bertinetto & Loporcaro,
2005; Payne, 2005). These contrasts occur word-internally,
intervocalically or before glides. A subset (the oral stops
and /f/) also occur before laterals and trills (e.g., accludere
[a'k:lu:dere], ``to enclose", and offro [`Of:ro], ``[I] offer").
While we are aware that there is discussion about geminate
representation (Goldsmith, 1990), we assume that the geminate-singleton opposition is primarily durational, and we
use the term ``geminate" to denote phonetically long ambisyllabic consonants (Bertinetto & Loporcaro, 2005; Payne,
2005).
There are also durational differences in Italian which are
related to segment position. As in other languages, Italian
singletons tend to be longer word-initially than word-medially. There are also durational differences among geminates.
Lexical geminates are word-medial, but geminates can also
appear at word boundaries, as a consequence of post-lexical
speech production processes. One such process is the socalled `raddoppiamento/rafforzamento fonosintattico',
which applies to word-initial consonants after word-final
stressed vowels when no pause intervenes (e.g., lengthening
of the initial [l] of latino in parlo latino [par'lO l:a'tino], ``[he]
talked Latin"). However, this phenomenon in still under debate (Agostiniani, 1992; Fanciullo, 1986; Loporcaro, 1997;
Marotta, 1986; Nespor & Vogel, 1986) and it undergoes
strong inter-regional and inter-speaker variations. We do
not consider it further. Another post-lexical process produces `false geminates'. These result from the single articulation of the same consonant occurring in word-final and
following word-initial position (e.g., the /l/ in al ladro, ``to
the [male] thief"). Although Italian words usually end with
vowels (Muljacic, 1972) and consonants usually occur only
word-initially or word-medially (henceforth restricted con-

308

sonants), a subset of the Italian sonorants (/n/, /r/ and /l/;
henceforth unrestricted consonants) also occur word-finally,
typically in prepositions and determiners (e.g., un, ``a [masculine]", per, ``for", del, ``from the"). When unrestricted consonants span a word boundary (e.g., in al ladro) they usually
fuse. The result is a false geminate that is shorter than a true
lexical geminate (Payne, 2005). This is the opposite of what
occurs with singletons. Word-medial lexical geminates tend
to be longer than word-boundary false geminates, but wordmedial singletons tend to be shorter than word-initial
singletons.
The durational differences between singletons and
geminates, at a given level in the prosodic hierarchy, tend
to be larger than the differences (within singletons and
within geminates) which signal consonant position. Segmental and positional information also differ in another
way. The segmental distinction is something that the Italian listener needs to make in order to resolve lexical ambiguities (e.g., fato vs. fatto). In contrast, while the positional
distinction is certainly of some value to the listener, there
could well be other segmentation cues (e.g., metrical or
phonotactic cues) that could be relied on instead. Thus,
not only is the segmental difference larger than the positional difference but also the segmental difference has
more informational value (i.e., it is more important for successful word recognition than the positional difference).
Italians may therefore use consonant duration only for segment and word identification purposes (i.e., for ``what"
decisions), and not for segmentation (``where" decisions).
Other results indeed suggest that the informational value of phonetic evidence determines the extent to which
that evidence is used by the listener. Wagner, Ernestus,
and Cutler (2006) found that, across languages, the extent
to which formant transition information influences consonant identification depends on the consonant inventory of
the language in question, that is, on the relative informational weight of the transition information in segment
identification. Furthermore, while differences in positive
Voice Onset Time (VOT; i.e., different amounts of aspiration) of word-initial stops in English modulate word recognition (Andruski, Blumstein, & Burton, 1994), differences in
negative VOT (i.e., different amounts of prevoicing) of
word-initial stops in Dutch have no measurable effect on
word recognition (van Alphen & McQueen, 2006). As van
Alphen and McQueen argued, this cross-linguistic difference likely reflects differences in the informational value
of VOT variation: the presence or absence of prevoicing appears to be the most critical information for Dutch listeners
to decide whether they have heard a voiced or voiceless
stop, whereas the amount of positive VOT is the most
important cue for the equivalent English decision.
One possible outcome of the present study may thus be
that consonant duration in Italian is used in a binary fashion,
simply to signal the important segmental distinction. Long
consonants might tend to be identified as geminates, and
short consonants as singletons, and more subtle and less
informative position-cueing durational differences may be
ignored. Alternatively, however, Italians may be able to pick
up on and use these subtle differences too. One reason to
predict that they might is the evidence from other languages
(reviewed above) that listeners are sensitive to fine-grained

acoustic differences. Furthermore, it has already been documented that Italians can use details in the acoustic signal to
modulate word recognition (Finocchiaro & Bertinetto, 2003;
Tabossi et al., 2000). With respect specifically to the geminate/singleton distinction, Pickett, Blumstein, and Burton
(1999) have shown that Italian listeners are sensitive to contextually dependent durational differences. Perception of
singletons and geminates was found to depend on the duration of the preceding vowel and the overall speech rate of the
utterance. Furthermore, Payne (2005) reports that the production of the geminate-singleton opposition varies as a
function of consonant type and prosodic factors (e.g., lexical
stress position and prominence). These data suggest that the
opposition is relative rather than absolute and hence that
Italian listeners may be sensitive to durational differences
within the singleton and geminate categories. That is, they
may do more than use duration to make a binary categorical
decision. If so, they may well be sensitive to the relatively
small durational contrasts which signal likely word
boundaries.
To what extent then, does consonant duration serve two
purposes in Italian spoken-word recognition? An answer to
this question should provide constraints on the nature of the
interdependencies of segmental and prosodic analysis, on
the sensitivity of the Italian speech-recognition system,
and on the relative informational value of consonant duration for segment identification and lexical segmentation.
Accordingly, four cross-modal priming experiments tested
the relative impact of durational contrasts when Italian listeners had to recognize words containing either geminates
(Experiments 1, 2 and 4) or singletons (Experiment 3).
Italian is an especially interesting test of whether duration has a dual purpose in speech recognition not only because of the asymmetry in the informational value of
duration but also, as already noted, because not all Italian
consonants appear in all structural positions. Italians could
be sensitive to fine durational contrasts only for consonants
that appear in all positions (the unrestricted consonants),
that is, only for those segments where position is more often
a relevant variable. Alternatively, Italians' sensitivity may
vary for restricted and unrestricted consonants depending
on whether they are identifying a geminate or a singleton.
Only unrestricted consonants can appear as false geminates.
In geminate recognition, therefore, fine durational differences signaling location may therefore be relevant for unrestricted consonants but not for restricted consonants. In
contrast, all Italian consonants (except /z/) appear as singletons both word-initially and word-medially. In singleton
recognition, therefore, Italian listeners may be sensitive to
small positional differences in duration for both types of
consonant. Stimuli therefore contained restricted and unrestricted consonants.
We will also report, for each experiment, different types
of statistical analysis. The experiments had a repeated-measures design in which participants were crossed with items.
We attempted to deal with the variability introduced by differences among subjects and items using counter-balancing
(Raaijmakers, Schrijnemakers, & Gremmen, 1999). Nevertheless, we used mixed-effect modeling with subjects and
items as crossed random effects (Baayen, 2008; Baayen,
Davidson, & Bates, 2008) in order to be able to include in

L. Tagliapietra, J.M. McQueen / Journal of Memory and Language 63 (2010) 306-323

the model variance which did not derive from the experimental manipulations. These primary mixed-effect analyses
will be presented alongside traditional F1/F2 analyses based
on averaged participant and item scores (Forster & Dickinson, 1976), and resulting min F0 values (Clark, 1973). This
comparison provides the reader with the opportunity to
compare directly the two types of analysis, in the context
of a repeated-measures design, and hence to evaluate the
potential advantages of mixed-effect modeling.

Experiment 1
We began by examining the influence of consonant
duration on the recognition of words with geminate consonants such as allarme, ``alarm". Participants were asked to
listen to neutral sentences containing those words as
primes (e.g., Marco descriveva l'allarme appena installato,
``Marco was describing the alarm just installed") and to
perform lexical decisions on visual targets. The targets
(e.g., allarme) appeared at the offset of the primes. The
prime was either related to the target or phonologically
and semantically unrelated to it. The critical consonants
of the related primes were spliced from another token of
the same word (e.g., geminate /l/ from allarme) or from
words in which the singleton counterpart of the geminate
was realized in either word-initial position (e.g., singleton
/l/ from ladra, ``thief") or word-medial position (e.g., singleton /l/ from alano, ``Great Dane").
We expected faster responses after related than after
unrelated primes in all three related conditions. The question was whether the different types of splicing would produce different degrees of priming. We predicted that the
primes with geminates would produce stronger priming
than those with singletons. If the large durational difference between geminate and singleton consonants signals
the segmental difference between the primes, then those
with geminates will be perceived as identical to the target
words (and thus produce a large priming effect), while
those with singletons should be perceived as closely-related but non-identical pseudo-words (and thus produce
a smaller priming effect).
We were confident that we would find strong effects of
consonant identity. The most interesting question was
whether, in addition, there would also be effects of consonant location. If Italians are sensitive to the fine durational
contrast that signals the position in which singleton consonants are realized, priming should be stronger after primes
containing (longer) initial singletons than after those with
(shorter) medial singletons. Such a finding would be a clear
demonstration that fine durational differences matter in
Italian speech recognition because it would show that singleton duration can even influence the recognition of a
word with a geminate (in Experiment 3 we provide a more
direct test by examining the effects of prime singleton
duration on the recognition of target words that themselves have singletons).
The lack of a difference between the two singleton conditions in Experiment 1 could mean at least three different
things. First, it could indicate that Italians use consonant
duration for ``what" processing, but not for ``where" pro-

309

cessing. Second, however, it could indicate a lack of methodological sensitivity in the priming task. Third, it could
indicate a lack of perceptual sensitivity. Italian listeners
may be sensitive to durational cues to segment position,
but only as a function of segment type. Durational differences among geminates but not among singletons could
be important when processing a word with a geminate
but not when processing a word with a singleton, and vice
versa. If that is the case, one would not expect an effect of
singleton duration in Experiment 1.
In order to be able to distinguish among these three alternatives, regression analyses were also planned. We could
take advantage of the variability in consonant duration in
our sample of materials to ask whether differences in priming effect size, by item across splicing condition, could be
predicted by the size of the difference in consonant duration.
If so, this would give an indication that Italian listeners do respond differentially to graded differences in consonant
duration. In this analysis, and indeed in the factorial analysis, a critical factor was type of consonant. As we have already argued, consonant duration in geminate recognition
may be more important for unrestricted consonants (those
that can occur as false geminates at word boundaries) than
for restricted consonants (those that cannot).
Method
Participants
The participants in all experiments were native speakers of Italian with no reported history of speech or hearing
difficulties. They were all students of the University of Trieste who either received course credits or volunteered;
none participated in more than one experiment. Fortyeight took part in Experiment 1.
Materials
Thirty-two Italian words containing a geminate consonant in second position were chosen as targets. They were
trisyllabic, stressed on the penultimate syllable and vowel
initial (e.g., allarme, alarm). Sixteen contained unrestricted
geminates (/n/, /l/, /r/; i.e., those that, as singletons, can appear in initial, medial and final position). The others contained restricted geminates (/p/, /t/, /k/, /b/, /d/, /g/, /a/, /f/,
/v/, /m/; i.e., those that, as singletons, can occur initially
and medially, but not finally). The mean frequencies of the
unrestricted and restricted targets (22.38 per million,
SD = 24.83, and 27.69 per million, SD = 26.06, respectively;
Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale del CNR, 1989) did
not differ (t(29) = 0.59, p = .56).
For each target (e.g., allarme), two other words were selected. They contained the singleton counterpart of the target's geminate, either in word-medial position (e.g., /l/ of
alano) or in word-initial position (e.g., /l/ of ladra). The critical consonants appeared in the same vocalic context in each
triplet, as defined either at the word level (e.g., alano) or at
the phrase level (e.g., la ladra, ``the [female] thief"). To avoid
any influence of lexical stress position on the relative duration of the consonants and their preceding vowels (Bertinetto & Vivalda, 1978; Pickett et al., 1999; Loporcaro,
1997; Payne, 2005), the critical consonants always appeared
before a stressed vowel. The mean frequency of words with

310

L. Tagliapietra, J.M. McQueen / Journal of Memory and Language 63 (2010) 306-323

medial singletons matching unrestricted targets was 11.57
per million (SD = 14.74); those matching restricted targets
had a mean frequency of 12.56 per million (SD = 36.29).
The mean frequencies of singleton-initial words were
178.44 per million (SD = 540.44) for words matching unrestricted targets and 62.63 per million (SD = 64.93) for words
matching restricted targets.
For each triplet, three semantically neutral sentences
were constructed so that - except for the critical consonant
- they were phonemically identical up to the third phoneme
of each prime word (e.g., Marco descriveva l'allarme appena
installato/Marco descriveva l'alano del suo vicino/Marco
descriveva la ladra alla polizia - ``Marco was describing the
alarm just installed/the Great Dane of his neighbor/the thief
to the police"). The targets are listed in the Appendix and
the full triplets of experimental sentences (also for the subsequent experiments) are available at http://pubman.mpdl.
mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:66955.
A further set of 128 words was selected as filler primes;
64 contained a geminate in second position. Forty-eight filler primes (16 with a geminate in second position) were
paired with phonemically unrelated filler target words.
The remaining 80 filler primes were paired with legal pseudo-word filler targets. Forty-eight pseudo-words contained
a geminate in second position and 24 of these were phonemically related to their paired prime. Half of the remaining
32 pseudo-words were also phonemically related to the corresponding prime. All filler primes were placed in sentences
similar to the experimental ones. A list of eight practice
items matching the experimental and filler materials was
also created. A female native speaker of Italian (from Torino)
read the complete list of sentences three times. Materials
were recorded directly on a PC at a sampling rate of 44 kHz
and edited with SoundEdit 16.2.
For each experimental triplet, one sentence containing
the target word (e.g., allarme) was chosen to appear as the
carrier sentence. This guaranteed that the context before
the target (including the immediately preceding vowel)
was always consistent with the target. The critical consonants were spliced into the carriers to create the primes in
the three experimental conditions. Primes (e.g., allarme)
contained a geminate taken from another token of that word
(e.g., /l/ from allarme), a word-initial singleton (e.g., /l/ from
ladra) or a word-medial singleton (e.g., /l/ from alano). Consonants were excised from the offset of the preceding vowels to the onset of the following vowel. Consonant durations
are given in Table 1. Reference points for the splicing procedure were obtained through the examination of waveforms
and spectrograms. With one exception (arringa, ``speech",
becoming aringa, ``herring"), the substitution of a geminate
with a singleton led to a pseudo-word. None of the resulting
experimental sentences contained clicks or other audible
discontinuities.
Four experimental lists were compiled. Each list contained 32 experimental and 128 filler trials. Prime-target
pairings of the experimental trials were rotated across lists
such that there was no repetition of stimuli within a list,
but all pairings appeared in the experiment as a whole. Each
list was divided into two blocks of 80 trials. In each block the
number of targets in each of the four experimental conditions and the number of different filler pairs were balanced.

The sentences with related primes also served as control
primes, by pairing them with targets to which they were
phonologically unrelated. Type of prime was rotated across
the control trials, such that the number of primes containing
a geminate, an initial and a medial singleton were as balanced as possible. Presentation order was semi-randomized
so that only filler targets appeared in the first 10 trials and no
more than three trials with a given target type (word or
pseudo-word) followed one another.
Procedure
Participants were tested individually in a quiet room.
Psyscope 1.2.5 carried out stimulus presentation, timing
and data collection. Sentences were presented with a
1500 ms inter-trial interval. Targets appeared in lower-case
in the centre of a computer screen at the offset of the prime
and disappeared either at the response or after 1500 ms.
Reaction Times (RTs) were measured from target onset. Participants were asked to listen to the sentences and to press
the right or the left key of a response-box depending on
whether the targets were real Italian words or not. After
the practice trials, participants were randomly assigned to
one of the experimental lists. The number of participants
for each list and block order was balanced.
Results and discussion
In this and all subsequent experiments, RTs below
350 ms and above 1250 ms were considered outliers and excluded from the analyses; the overall percentage of errors
(outliers, wrong and missed responses) was 5.92%. Mean
RTs and error rates in the experimental conditions are
shown in Table 2. Both RTs and response accuracy were analyzed. The primary RT results are based on a mixed-effects
model with participants and items as crossed random effects
(Baayen et al., 2008; Pinheiro & Bates, 2000), as implemented in the lmer and LanguageR packages in R (Baayen,
2008; Bates, 2007). In all experiments, correct RTs were initially fitted in a full model including the factors prime condition, rank of the stimulus in the experiment, consonant type
(unrestricted vs. restricted), duration of spliced consonant,
and log-transformed lexical frequency of the target, and
with participant and item as random intercepts and by-participant rank of the stimulus as random slopes. Rank was included because preliminary analysis revealed that
performance changed over the course of the experiment,
and did so differently across participants. With the removal
of non-significant predictors (consonant type and consonant duration), RTs were found to be fitted, without a significant loss of fit relative to the full model (v2(2) = 1.03,
p = .60), as a function of prime condition, lexical frequency,
and stimulus rank, with random intercepts for participants
(v2(1) = 90.53, p < .001) and items (v2(1) = 67.61, p < .001)
and by-participant random slopes for rank (v2(1) = 19.83,

condition and consonant type. Only differences between the
mixed-effect and traditional analyses are discussed (in this
and subsequent experiments). The 95% Confidence Intervals
(CIs) for contrasts are based on the F1 analyses.
There was a main effect of prime condition (see Table 3).
Lexical decisions were faster after related than after control
primes, regardless of whether related primes contained a
geminate or a singleton (control vs. geminates, mean difference = 79 ms, 95%CI = 25 ms; control vs. initial singletons,
mean difference = 54 ms, 95%CI = 23 ms; control vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 58 ms, 95%CI = 23 ms).
But responses were faster after primes with a geminate than
after primes with a singleton (geminates vs. initial singletons, mean difference = 26 ms, 95%CI = 23 ms; geminates
vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 21 ms, 95%CI =
20 ms) and there was no difference after primes with initial
vs. medial singletons (medial vs. initial singletons, mean difference = 4 ms, 95%CI = 19 ms). There was no effect of target type, and no interactions involving this factor. RTs to
targets with unrestricted and restricted consonants thus
patterned similarly. There was an effect of target frequency
(F(1, 1436) = 15.11, p < .001), but this interacted with prime
condition (F(3, 1436) = 2.65, p = .05). Specifically, targets
with a higher lexical frequency elicited faster responses
(t(1436) = 4.65, p < .001), but, as a further reflection of
stronger priming from primes which contained geminate
consonants than from those containing singletons, this standard frequency effect was reduced after - and only after -
primes with geminates (t(1436) = 2.79, p < .01).
The accuracy analysis was carried out using generalized
mixed-effect modeling, as implemented in LanguageR (Baayen, 2008), which enables one to run log-linear regressions
on categorical data. Correct responses were initially fitted in

a full model with the same predictors as the initial RT model.
Removal of non-significant predictors (consonant duration
and stimulus rank) did not result in a significant loss of fit
(v2(6) = .00, p = 1). Correct responses were hence fitted in a
reduced model as a function of (log-transformed) target frequency (F(1, 1530) = 14.50, p < .001), consonant type (restricted vs. unrestricted: F(1, 1530) = 5.99, p < .05) and
prime condition (F(3, 1530) = 8.64, p < .001), with random
intercepts for participants (v2(1) = 6.31, p < .05) and items
(v2(1) = 7.97, p < .01). This model revealed that restricted targets elicited fewer errors than unrestricted targets (z = 2.00,
p < .05) and that response accuracy increased as a function of
target frequency (z = 3.49, p < .001). Further, responses
were more accurate after related than after control primes
(medial singletons: z = 2.79, p < .01; initial singletons
z = 3.07, p < .01; geminates: z = 3.65, p < .001).
These RT and error analyses revealed facilitated responses after related primes than after unrelated control
primes. Responses to target words containing geminate
consonants were faster and more accurate after the same
words had been heard than after unrelated primes. In addition, target responses were faster and more accurate after
related pseudo-word primes (identical except for the substitution of a singleton for the geminate) than after unrelated primes. Furthermore, the RT analyses showed that
responses after primes with geminates were faster than responses after primes with singletons. There was no indication of an effect of the position in which the singletons had
originally been articulated.
These results indicate that Italians use consonant duration to distinguish geminates from their singleton counterparts. As presented so far, they also suggest that consonant
duration may be used in a categorical manner, with no

graded sensitivity to subtle differences in consonant duration (the two types of singleton-bearing prime had the same
effect). The mean durational difference between the two
types of singleton was very small however (only 4 ms, see
Table 1). Regression analyses thus tested further for more
specific effects of graded sensitivity by comparing difference
measures. Durational differences between the spliced consonants in each pair of conditions (i.e., geminates vs. medial
singletons, geminates vs. initial singletons, and initial vs.
medial singletons) were compared, item by item, with the
appropriate differences in the RT priming effects across
those condition pairs (averaged over participants since byparticipant variability in RT effects is orthogonal to any effects of consonant duration, which would necessarily be
purely within-item effects). Relative to the main analyses,
these follow-up analyses provide a more specific test of sensitivity to differences among the versions of the critical
experimental consonants by focusing on those differences,
by excluding the unrelated (control) consonants, and by factoring out differences in duration that are intrinsic to individual consonants (e.g., that /k/ may tend to be shorter
than /p/). Note that it would be impossible to include within-consonant duration differences as a factor in the main

MinF'

analyses, since those analyses necessarily include the control condition, and that condition involves other consonants
(and hence uncontrolled between-consonant differences).
As the durational difference between consonants became
larger, so did the differences in RTs (F(1, 94) = 12.15,
p < .001). As shown in Fig. 1, this effect depended on type
of consonant (restricted vs. unrestricted) and on which conditions were contrasted. For differences between initial and
medial singletons, no effect was detected for either
unrestricted (t(14) = 0.24, b = 0.29, p = .81) or restricted
targets (t(14) = 0.76, b = 0.51, p = .46). The durational differences between the spliced geminates and medial singletons,
however, predicted the differences in RTs after primes with
those consonants for primes with unrestricted consonants
(t(14) = 2.48, b = 1.36, p = .03) but not restricted consonants (t(14) = 0.14, b = 0.06, p = .89). Furthermore, the durational differences between geminates and initial singletons
predicted priming effects when primes contained unrestricted consonants (t(14) = 2.47, b = 1.45, p = .03), but
not when primes had restricted consonants (t(14) = 0.55,
b = 0.73, p = .59).
Note that no effects of consonant duration were found in
the main analyses. We suggest that this was because, in the

L. Tagliapietra, J.M. McQueen / Journal of Memory and Language 63 (2010) 306-323

mixed-effect modeling, consonant durations were absolute
values, corresponding to the different versions of the critical
consonants in the related trials and to the different consonants in the control condition, and hence that those analyses
included spurious variation in consonant duration. The
regression analyses provide a cleaner measure of the effect
of consonant duration variance.
The regression analyses show that durational differences
predicted priming effects only for the unrestricted consonants. These are the consonants which form false geminates
when they occur at word boundaries (e.g., al ladro). This suggests that Italian listeners do not only use the large, global
difference in duration between geminates and singletons
for segment identification, but also are sensitive to smaller
differences among consonants in their duration. In the case
of geminate recognition, however, this sensitivity appears to
be limited to geminates that can vary in location. Italian listeners thus appear to be finely tuned to the informational
value of consonant duration. This may be why they did not
appear to rely on the durational contrast between initial
and medial singletons: it was not sufficiently informative
with respect to the position of the geminate consonant.

Experiment 2
Our explanation for the results of Experiment 1 leads to a
clear prediction. If small differences in the duration of a geminate influence its recognition, then differences in priming
between (longer) lexical geminates and (shorter) false geminates should be found. Experiment 2 tested this prediction.
In addition to the three types of consonant already tested,
false geminates were included. Because only unrestricted
consonants could be used in all four of these conditions, this
alteration necessitated the exclusion of all restricted consonants. An important methodological change was also made.
In Experiment 1, participants were presented with visual
targets at the offset of auditory words (or related pseudowords), embedded in neutral sentences. It is possible that
some effects were not detected because, by the time the targets were presented, prime recognition tended to be complete, and differential effects of consonant duration may
thus have tended to be washed out. A potentially more sensitive fragment priming task (Donselaar, Koster, & Cutler,
2005) was therefore used.
Participants were asked to make lexical decisions to visual targets with geminates (e.g., allieve, ``[female] pupils"),
presented at the acoustic offset of truncated sentences.
These sentences ended with fragment primes, which were
either unrelated (e.g., colla from collane, ``necklaces") or related (e.g., allie, from e.g. allieve) to the visual targets. The last
consonants of the primes were cross-spliced with other tokens of geminates and singletons realized either in wordmedial position (lexical geminate: allieve; medial singleton:
aliene, ``[female] aliens") or at word boundaries (false geminate: al lieto, ``to the happy"; initial singleton: a lieto, ``to happy"). The duration of the last consonant of the related
fragments (e.g., /l/ in allie) thus disambiguated the parsing
of the truncated sentences, making them compatible with
one of four possible continuations: a word containing a lexical geminate (e.g., allieve), a sequence of two words that

313

encourages the realization of a false geminate (al lieto), a
word beginning with the singleton counterpart of that consonant (a lieto), or a word containing the singleton counterpart of that consonant (aliene). This situation is different
from that in Experiment 1, where the words with geminates
could unambiguously be recognized as such, and the items
with singletons could unambiguously be recognized as
pseudo-words.
The Experiment 1 results suggest that target responses
should be faster after geminate-bearing than after singleton-bearing primes. They also suggest that listeners might
use duration to locate consonants. It was thus possible that
(longer) fragments with lexical geminates would produce
stronger priming of responses to words containing those
geminates than (shorter) fragments with false geminates.
The durational differences between initial and medial singletons, however, were not expected to produce an effect.
Although the primes were now ambiguous fragments, potentially allowing their interpretation as words containing singletons, the Experiment 1 results still suggest that it is
unlikely that differences in singleton duration would influence decisions to targets containing geminates. Listeners
might be insensitive to these singleton contrasts because
they are not sufficiently informative with respect to the position of geminates.

Fifty-five participants took part. Thirty Italian trisyllabic
words containing a liquid geminate (5 /r/ and 25 /l/) were
selected to appear as visual targets (see Appendix). Sixteen
began with a vowel and contained the geminate consonant
in second position (e.g., allieve, pupils); the remainder began with a consonant and the geminate appeared in third
position (e.g., collega, colleague). Lexical stress always fell
on the vowel following the geminate. The average frequencies of the targets per million were 20.50 (SD = 31.31) for
vowel-initial words and 16.50 (SD = 24.74) for consonantinitial words (t(28) = 0.38, p = .71).
Four sentences were created for each target word. In
each quadruplet, the first sentence contained the target
word (e.g., allieve), the second contained a word beginning
with the singleton counterpart of the critical geminate preceded by a word ending with the same consonant (e.g., al
lieto), the third contained a word beginning with the singleton counterpart of the critical geminate preceded by a
word ending with the same vowel that preceded the geminate in the target word (e.g., a lieto) and the fourth sentence contained a word with the same vowel followed by
a singleton in medial position (e.g., aliene). Sentences were
created so that in each quadruplet the critical consonant
(e.g., /l/) occurred in the same vocalic context and in prestressed position. Preceding contexts were neutral and
the number of syllables prior to the critical consonant
was matched as closely as possible. In order to maintain
neutrality across contexts, however, it was not possible
to avoid either the use of different preceding contexts
within a quadruplet or the use of the same sentences for
different target words.
A further set of 130 words was selected as filler primes;
65 contained a geminate. Fifty filler primes, 25 of which

contained a geminate, were paired to phonemically unrelated filler target words. The remaining 80 filler primes
were coupled to legal pseudo-word targets. Twenty-four
pseudo-words were phonemically related to their primes,
12 of which contained a geminate. All filler primes were inserted in sentences similar to the experimental ones. A list
of 10 practice items matching the experimental and filler
materials was also created.
A female native speaker of Italian (from Trento, different from the speaker used in Experiment 1) read the complete list of sentences three times. Materials were recorded
and edited as in the previous experiment, except that, after
the consonants had been cross-spliced, all sentences were
truncated after the vowel following the critical consonant
(e.g., after the /i/ of allieve). There were no audible clicks
at the truncation points. Consonant durations are given
in Table 1. Five experimental lists were compiled and
semi-randomized with the same rationale as in Experiment 1. The procedure was the same as before.
Results and discussion
The overall percentage of errors (outliers as defined in
Experiment 1, plus wrong and missed responses) was
12.85%. Mean RTs and error rates are shown in Table 4. RTs
were again fitted in a mixed model that, differently from
the previous experiment, did not include type of consonant
as a predictor. Non-significant predictors (consonant
duration and stimulus rank) were excluded from the
analyses with no significant loss of fit (v2(10) = 10.70, p =
.38). Table 3 reports the effects detected by this reduced
model in which RTs were fitted as a function of prime condition and (log-transformed) lexical frequency of the target,
with random intercepts for participants (v2(1) = 344.97,
p < .001) and items (v2(1) = 82.48, p < .001). As in Experiment 1, RTs were strongly affected by target frequency
(F(1, 1432) = 20.66, p < .001). However, the effect of prime
condition did not depend on the frequency of the target

(F(4, 1428) = 1.00, p = .40) and a model that included this
interaction fitted the data no better than the final model
(v2(4) = 4.03, p = .40).
Responses were faster after primes with lexical and
false geminates than after control primes (control vs. lexical geminates, mean difference = 33 ms, 95%CI = 29 ms;
control vs. false geminates, mean difference = 26 ms,
95%CI = 28 ms) and than after primes with singletons
(lexical geminates vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 49 ms, 95%CI = 26 ms; lexical geminates vs. initial
singletons, mean difference = 44 ms, 95%CI = 22 ms; false
geminates vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 42 ms,
95%CI = 29 ms; false geminates vs. initial singletons,
mean difference = 37 ms, 95%CI = 26 ms). RTs in the control, medial singleton and initial-singleton conditions did
not differ from each other (control vs. medial singletons,
mean difference = 16 ms, 95%CI = 34 ms; control vs. initial
singletons, mean difference = 11 ms, 95%CI = 34 ms; initial vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 5 ms, 95%CI
= 33 ms). Finally, there was no difference between the false
and lexical geminate conditions (mean difference = 6 ms,
95%CI = 21 ms).
Accuracy was initially evaluated with the same full model
as that used as the starting point in the RT analysis. A simpler
model excluding non-significant predictors (consonant duration and stimulus rank) fitted the data as well as the full model (v2(10) = 10.75, p = .38) and explained accuracy as a
function of the lexical frequency of the target (F(1, 1644) =
24.04, p < .001) and the prime condition (F(4, 1644) = 4.05,
p < .01), with participants (v2(1) = 20.58, p < .001) and items
(v2(1) = 66.87, p < .001) as random intercepts. The accuracy
increased as a function of target frequency (z = 4.67,
p < .001). Further, fewer errors followed primes with lexical
geminates than control primes (z = 1.92, p = .05) and primes
with initial (z = 1.84, p = .06) and medial singletons
(z = 2.47, p < .05). Similarly, responses were more accurate
after primes with false geminates than after control primes
(z = 2.39, p < .05) and primes with initial (z = 2.35,

L. Tagliapietra, J.M. McQueen / Journal of Memory and Language 63 (2010) 306-323

p < .05) and medial singletons (z = 2.97, p < .01). Responses
after control primes were as accurate as after primes with
medial (z = 0.58, p = .56) and initial singletons (z = 0.06,
p = .95) and responses after medial singletons were as accurate as after initial singletons (z = 0.65, p = .51). Accuracy
also did not differ after primes with false or lexical geminates
(z = 0.58, p = .58).
These analyses indicate that responses were faster and
more accurate after primes with geminates than after
unrelated primes and related primes with singletons. Unlike in Experiment 1, related primes with singletons did
not facilitate responses. In Experiment 1 the priming effect
after related nonwords might have derived from the larger
prime-target overlap for which - except for one case (i.e.,
aringa) - there was no other possible lexical interpretation
of the primes than as the targets. In contrast, the fragments
in Experiment 2 had potentially more than one possible
continuation. This ambiguity increased the number of possible lexical hypotheses and, therefore, the effect of lexical
competition. This may explain the reduced priming effects
from primes with singletons.
The priming effects for fragments with lexical and false
geminates once again suggest that Italians rely on large
durational differences to discriminate between geminates
and singletons. These results may also again suggest that
this information was not used in a continuous way, but
rather in a binary way, simply to classify sets of long vs.
short consonants. To assess this hypothesis, a regression
analysis like that in Experiment 1 examined the priming
effects as a function of the durational differences of the
spliced consonants.
Durational differences did not predict the differences in
RTs overall (F(1, 176) = 1.29, p = .26), but did do so as a function of the lexical frequency of the target (F(1, 176) = 6.13,
p < .05). The priming effect increased as a function of the
durational differences, but was reduced as the targets' frequency increased. Further individual regressions showed
that these effects held for comparisons between lexical
and false geminates (t(26) = 3.66, b = 2.30, p < .01) and between initial and medial singletons (t(26) = 1.82, b = 2.36,
p = .08), but not for the other comparisons (lexical geminates vs. initial singletons, lexical geminates vs. medial singletons, false geminates vs. initial singletons and false
geminates vs. medial singletons). The strongest two effects
are plotted in Fig. 2. It is important to note, however, that
in both these cases the effect was reduced as target frequency increased (geminates: t(26) = 2.96, b = 0.59,
p < .01; singletons: t(26) = 2.39, b = 0.97, p < .05).
The large durational differences (i.e., those between
geminates and singletons) were therefore not predictive of
priming effects, but, as the frequency of the target words deTable 4

creased, the small durational differences that occurred between lexical and false geminates and (to a lesser extent)
between initial and medial singletons were predictive of
the differences in RTs. These results indicate that listeners
were affected by increasing differences in the duration of
the consonants and, like the results of the regression analyses in Experiment 1, are not consistent with strictly categorical use of duration. Instead, it would appear that Italians are
sensitive to gradual differences in duration, at least in
geminates.
Experiments 1 and 2 thus suggest that, in particular circumstances, Italian listeners can rely on fine durational differences that might help them locate geminates in the
speech stream. Specifically, it appears that a longer consonant is a better match to a true lexical geminate, which
must appear in word-medial position. But there was only
a weak effect of singleton duration on the recognition of
words containing geminates. Given the stronger durational
effect of geminate consonants on the recognition of geminate-bearing words, it is plausible that a similar effect
could be found for singleton consonant duration on the
recognition of singleton-bearing words. This prediction
was tested in Experiment 3. The differences in duration between lexical and false geminates and between initial and
medial singletons were about the same (see Table 1).
Geminates, however, were about 150% longer than singletons, so that, on average, medial and initial singletons diverged from one another by 11% of their duration, while
false and lexical geminates diverged by only 6% of their
duration. The proportional difference in duration is thus
larger for singletons than for geminates. In Experiment 3
we therefore tested whether an effect of duration is detectable for singletons by presenting visual targets that have a
singleton in medial position. We expected effects of consonant duration on the recognition of words with singletons
not only because the proportional durational difference is
larger for singletons, but also because duration is informative about the location of effectively all singleton consonants. The results of Experiment 1 suggest that positional
contrasts for geminates are relevant only for those which
appear both word-medially and at word boundaries (i.e.,
as false geminates). But both sets of consonants appear in
initial and medial position as singletons. In Experiment 3,
therefore, both restricted and unrestricted consonants
were tested, with the expectation that both would show
durational effects.

Experiment 3
As in Experiment 2, participants listened to neutral sentences ending in a fragment (e.g., Marco descriveva l'ala. . .,
``Marco was describing the ala. . .") and made lexical decisions on visual targets presented at fragment offset. The
last consonant of each fragment was spliced from words
uttered in the same context that contained either a singleton in word-medial (e.g., /l/ from alano) or word-initial position (e.g., /l/ from ladra) or its geminate counterpart (e.g.,
/l/ from allarme). Fragments were unrelated (e.g., /aFe/
from Anita cercava un'age. . ., ``Anita was looking for a . . .")
or related (e.g., /ala/ in Marco descriveva l'ala. . .) to the vi-

imental lists were created in the same way as in Experiment 1. Materials were recorded by the same speaker as
in Experiment 2 and edited as in the previous experiments
(for consonant durations see Table 1). The procedure was
the same as before.

sual targets that, unlike in Experiments 1 and 2, contained
singletons (e.g., alano).
If Italian listeners use the duration of consonants only
to identify geminates and singletons, then responses
should be faster after primes with both medial and initial
singletons than after unrelated primes and primes with
geminates, but responses after primes with medial singletons should not be faster than after primes with initial singletons. In contrast, if Italians are sensitive to the small
durational differences occurring in consonants realized in
different structural positions, then responses should be
faster after fully consistent primes with medial singletons
than after inconsistent primes with initial singletons.

Method
Forty participants took part. Thirty-two Italian words
were chosen to appear as visual targets (see Appendix). Sixteen contained medial singleton unrestricted consonants
(/n/, /l/, /r/); the other 16 had medial singleton restricted
R
consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/, /b/, /d/, /g/, /t /, /dZ/, /v/). The number of targets with restricted and unrestricted consonants
was matched between targets beginning with a vowel (14
restricted, 14 unrestricted) and those beginning with a consonant (two restricted, two unrestricted). Critical consonants occurred in second position in the vowel-initial
words, and in third position in the consonant-initial words.
Twenty-six words were trisyllabic and stressed on the penultimate syllable; the other six were four syllables long and
stressed on the antepenultimate syllable (i.e., the critical
consonant was always in pre-stressed position). The mean
frequencies of the targets per million were 14.50
(SD = 15.41) for unrestricted words and 20.13 (SD = 42) for
restricted words (t(30) = 0.50, p = .62).
For each target word three semantically neutral sentences were created. One of them contained the target
word (e.g., alano), the second contained a word beginning
with the critical consonant (e.g., ladra) and the third contained a word with the geminate counterpart of the critical
consonant (e.g., allarme). All the sentences were phonemically congruent up to a point corresponding to the second
vowel of the target word. Fillers, practice trials and exper-

The overall percentage of errors (outliers as defined in
Experiment 1, plus wrong and missed responses) was
12.34%. Mean RTs and error rates are shown in Table 5. Table
3 reports the tests of the mixed model that fitted RTs as a
function of the rank of the stimulus, the prime condition
and the frequency of the prime (F(1, 1112) = 23.80,
p < .001) and the frequency of the target (F(1, 1112) =
11.09, p < .001), with random intercepts for participants
(v2(1) = 94.73, p < .001) and items (v2(1) = 35.64, p < .001)
and by-participant random slopes for the rank of the stimulus (v2(1) = 5.95, p = .01). RTs were initially fitted with the
same full model as in Experiment 1, but the removal of the
non-significant predictors (consonant duration and consonant type) did not cause a significant loss of fit
(v2(2) = 2.68, p = .26).
As can been seen in Table 3, responses after primes with
medial and initial singletons were faster than after unrelated primes (control vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 30 ms, 95%CI = 19 ms; control vs. initial singletons,
mean difference = 29 ms, 95%CI = 22 ms). There was no difference after primes with geminates than after unrelated
primes (mean difference = 3 ms, 95%CI = 19 ms). Furthermore, RTs were faster after primes with medial singletons
than after primes with geminates (mean difference = 28 ms,
95%CI = 21 ms), and responses were faster after primes
with medial singletons than after primes with initial singletons. But this last result was not replicated in the traditional
analysis (mean difference = 1 ms, 95%CI = 17 ms; see Table
3). The traditional analysis also indicated that RTs after
primes with initial singletons were faster than after primes
with geminates (mean difference = 26 ms, 95%CI = 18 ms),
a difference that was not reflected in the mixed-effect
modeling.
The mixed-effect and traditional analyses thus led to different results. In particular, fitting the RTs with the mixed
model made it possible to detect facilitation for responses
produced by primes with medial singletons relative to
primes with initial singletons. This facilitation indicates
that Italian listeners are sensitive to durational differences
between singleton consonants articulated in different structural positions. This effect, however, depended on the lexical
frequency of the visual targets and hence was not detectable
with traditional statistical techniques. The mixed-effect
modeling revealed an interaction of the effect of the prime
condition with target frequency (F(3, 1112) = 4.28, p < .01).
Targets with a higher lexical frequency elicited faster responses (t(1112) = 4.14, p < .001); however, this effect
was reduced after - and only after - primes containing
medial singletons (t(1112) = 3.29, p < .01). That is, as shown
in Fig. 3, the lexical frequency of the targets influenced the
speed of responses less after primes with medial singletons
than in any other priming condition. As a consequence,
average latencies in the medial singleton condition were

317

very similar to those in the initial singleton condition (see
Table 5). This interaction explains the apparent difference
between the results obtained with the two techniques
and why the small overall effect (of 1 ms when expressed
as a mean difference) was nonetheless significant in the
mixed-model analysis. Responses to lower-frequency targets after primes with initial singletons were faster than
after primes with medial singletons, but this effect reversed
for higher-frequency targets (see Fig. 3). That is, once the
effects of frequency were taken into account, singleton consonant duration influenced target recognition.
Response accuracy was also first evaluated with the same
initial model as was used in Experiment 1. The removal of
the non-significant predictors (consonant duration and
stimulus rank) led to a simpler model with no significant loss
of fit (v2(4) = 0.00, p = 1). The final model showed an effect of
the frequency of the target (F(1, 1271) = 25.44, p < .001) and
an interaction between the effect of prime condition and
type of consonant (F(3, 1271) = 2.74, p < .05), with random
intercepts for participants (v2(1) = 9.90, p < .01) and items
(v2(1) = 74.34, p < .001). As the frequency of the targets increased so did the accuracy of the responses (z = 5.07,
p < .001). This model revealed that responses to targets with
unrestricted consonants were more accurate after primes
with initial singletons than after control primes (z = 5.07,
p < .001) and primes with medial singletons (z(1271) =
5.07, p < .001) and geminates (z = 5.07, p < .001). Instead
responses to restricted targets were equally accurate in all
conditions.
As in the previous experiments, further regression analyses tested the contribution of the durational differences of
the spliced consonants to the RT priming effects. Differences in RTs in each pair of related conditions were fitted
in a linear model as a function of the durational differences
of the spliced consonants, the contrasted conditions (geminate vs. initial singleton, geminate vs. medial singleton,
initial vs. medial singleton) and the type of consonant (restricted vs. unrestricted). The differences in priming effects
varied across the contrasted conditions (F(2, 87) = 7.00,
p < .01) and depended on the durational differences between the spliced consonants (F(1, 87) = 22.67, p < .001).
Type of consonant neither had an effect (F(1, 87) = 0.70,
p = .40) nor interacted with the effect of duration
(F(1, 87) = 0.26, p = .61). The difference in priming effects
between the medial- and initial-singleton conditions was
smaller than the difference between the initial-singleton
and geminate conditions (t(89) = 5.16, b = 91.99, p < .001)
and the difference between the medial-singleton and geminate conditions (t(89) = 2.96, b = 45.68, p < .01). Furthermore, the difference in priming effects between the
geminate and the medial-singleton conditions were larger

than that between the geminate and the initial-singleton
conditions (t(89) = 2.51, b = 46.31, p < .05). These analyses
confirm that the amount of priming varied across conditions and show an overall effect of consonant duration.
Further analysis demonstrated at least strong trends (see
Fig. 4) towards effects of duration for each separate pair
of contrasted conditions (geminate vs. medial singletons:
t(29) = 3.53, b = 0.64, p < .01; geminate vs. initial singletons: t(29) = 1.88, b = 0.91, p = .07; medial vs. initial singletons: t(29) = 1.80, b = 0.71, p = .08).
These regression analyses are consistent with the positional effect detected with the mixed model. Priming effects observed after primes with medial singletons were
larger than those observed after primes with initial singletons. Unlike Experiment 1, and as predicted, these analyses
did not reveal an interaction between the effect of the
durational difference and type of consonant. The evaluation of the duration of initial and medial singletons indeed
involves all consonants that appear word-initially and not
only those that appear both word-initially and word-finally. The overall effect of the durational differences and the
equivalence of this effect across conditions indicate that
duration is a good predictor in each comparison. Italian listeners thus appear to rely on this information to distinguish geminates from singletons and to discriminate
between medial and initial singletons. The pattern of results across experiments also suggests that the effect of position surfaces more clearly in the circumstances in which
it is more informative to listeners: there were stronger effects of differences in singleton duration when listeners
had to identify words containing singletons than when
they had to identify words bearing geminates.
Experiment 4
In a final control experiment, targets with geminates (e.g.,
allarme) were presented under the same priming conditions
as in Experiment 3. This experiment was run to see whether
it would be possible to replicate the effects for targets with
geminates that were found in Experiment 1 in spite of the
change in task (Experiment 4 uses fragment priming; Experiment 1 used full-word priming) and with the spoken materials from Experiment 3 that had produced graded effects of
consonant duration for targets with singletons.
Method
Forty participants took part. The materials and recording from Experiment 3 were used, but here the targets corresponded to the words containing geminates. Their mean

Fig. 3. Averaged RTs for experimental items of Experiment 3, plotted as a
function of experimental condition and lexical frequency of the visual
target (the cut-off was set at the median of the frequencies, 18.82 per
million, which equally divided the number of items).

frequencies per million were 13.06 (SD = 21.93) for unrestricted targets and 38.94 (SD = 41.37) for restricted targets
(t(30) = 2.21, p = .04). Unlike in Experiment 3, the sentences containing the target word (e.g., allarme) were chosen to appear as the carrier sentences. The critical
consonants in the prime came from other tokens of the
same geminate in the same word, or were matched initial
or medial singletons. The same splicing procedure was
used as in Experiment 3. As the splicing procedure involved new tokens, the durations of the critical consonants
were different (see Table 1). Filler and practice trials and
experimental lists were created in the same way as before.
The procedure was also the same.
Results and discussion
The overall percentage of errors (outliers as defined in
Experiment 1, plus wrong and missed responses) was
9.38%. Mean RTs and error rates are shown in Table 6. RTs
and accuracy were initially fitted as a function of the same
initial predictors as in Experiments 1 and 3. In the RT analysis, the removal of the non-significant predictors consonant
type and consonant duration did not result a significant loss

of fit (v2(6) = 0.00, p = 1). The reduced model explained the
data as a function of prime condition and target frequency
(F(1, 1155) = 20.42, p < .001), with random intercepts for
participants (v2(1) = 169.25, p < .001) and items (v2(1) =
95.21, p < .001) and by-participant random slopes for the
rank of the stimulus (v2(1) = 14.06, p < .001). As reported
in Table 3, results patterned as in Experiment 1. RTs were
faster after related primes than after unrelated primes

28 ms, 95%CI = 23 ms; control vs. medial singletons, mean
difference = 21 ms, 95%CI = 25 ms) and after primes with
geminates than after primes with singletons (geminates
vs. initial singletons, mean difference = 36 ms, 95%CI =
24 ms; geminates vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 43 ms, 95%CI = 24 ms). As in Experiments 1 and 2,
no difference was detected between the medial and initialsingleton conditions (initial vs. medial singletons, mean difference = 8 ms, 95%CI = 18 ms).
Correct responses were also equally well fitted by a simpler
model (v2(8) = 8.74, p = .37), as a function of prime condition
(F(1, 1274) = 3.49, p < .05), stimulus rank (F(1, 1274) = 3.59,
p = .06) and target frequency (F(1, 1274) = 11.66, p < .001), with
a random intercept for items (v2(1) = 31.04, p < .001); participants, consonant type and consonant duration were non-significant predictors in the full model. The simpler model revealed
more accurate responses after primes with geminates than after
control primes (z = 3.12, p < .01), primes with medial singletons
(z = 2.13, p < .05) and initial singletons (z = 2.40, p < .05).
Responses were equally accurate in all the other conditions.
Regression analyses indicated that the durational differences of the spliced consonants in the prime fragments predicted the priming effects as a function of the contrasted
conditions and the type of consonant (F(2, 84) = 3.49,
p = .03). Further regression for each contrasted condition revealed a reliable interaction between the effect of duration
and type of consonant only in the case of singletons: durational differences between initial and medial unrestricted
singletons predicted differences in RTs (t(14) = 2.24,
b = 4.50, p = .04), but not those between restricted singletons (t(14) = 0.61, b = 0.67, p = .55). Neither the effects
of duration and type of consonants nor their interaction
were reliable in the regression for the other conditions.

These results confirm the results obtained in Experiment 2,
in which only unrestricted consonants were presented and
in which regression analyses showed a strong trend for the
effects of durational differences between medial and initial
singletons.
The results of Experiment 4 are consistent with those of
Experiment 1. The difference between Experiments 1 and 3
(an effect of singleton duration in the main analysis only in
the latter case) therefore cannot be attributed to differences in materials or tasks.
General discussion
Four cross-modal priming experiments support the
hypothesis that Italians rely on segment duration for
``what" functions (i.e., to identify consonants as either
geminates or singletons) and ``where" functions (i.e., to locate consonants in the speech stream). There were strong
effects of consonant identity and weaker effects of consonant location.
With respect to consonant identity, spoken primes containing geminate consonants (words or fragments of those
words) facilitated the recognition of visual versions of those
words more than primes which were identical except that
they contained the singleton variants of the geminates
(Experiments 1, 2 and 4). In addition, fragments of spoken
words with singletons - but not those with the equivalent
geminates - primed recognition of visual versions of the singleton-bearing words (Experiment 3). These findings are
consistent with previous demonstrations that differences
involving a single phoneme change strongly impact spoken-word recognition (Connine, Blasko, & Titone, 1993;
Connine, Titone, Deelman, & Blasko, 1997; Marslen-Wilson
& Zwitserlood, 1989). They suggest that Italian listeners detect the phonemic contrast between singleton and geminate
consonants, which is cued by a large durational difference,
and use that contrast to recognize words.
These findings also provide a baseline against which we
could measure whether more subtle differences in consonant duration can also be used by Italian listeners to locate
consonants. Regression analyses in each experiment
showed that word recognition in Italian is modulated by
the size of the durational difference between consonants.
It is important to note that these analyses support the
claim that it was the duration of the spliced consonants
(rather than some other acoustic-phonetic detail) which
was responsible for the observed effects. If other types of
acoustic-phonetic information were responsible, they
would have to be strongly correlated with durational differences. It seems more parsimonious to conclude, on the
basis of the available evidence, that it is duration which

is the driving force behind these effects. With respect to
the recognition of words containing geminates, sensitivity
to degree of durational difference was limited to words
with unrestricted consonants (i.e., those which can appear
in initial, medial and, critically, final position). The regressions in Experiments 1, 2 and 4 thus suggest that the duration of a geminate is particularly important when it signals
the consonant's likely position, as a (word-internal) true
geminate or a (word-edge) false geminate. Regression
analyses in Experiment 3 showed that, for words containing singletons, Italians were sensitive to the size of the
durational differences among both unrestricted and restricted consonants. Furthermore, the mixed-model analysis in Experiment 3 detected that, for low-frequency
targets (again with consonants of both types), responses
after primes with (shorter) medial singletons were faster
than after primes with (longer) initial singletons. These results indicate that Italian listeners are also sensitive to differences in singleton duration.
Differential sensitivity to consonant duration
We observed several differences in the degree to which
Italians are sensitive to consonant duration. First, and
unsurprisingly, the large durational differences which signal segment identity had larger effects than the smaller
differences which signal segment location. This was to be
expected not only because of the larger physical difference
in the former case (see Table 1) but also because of the
greater informational value of the segmental difference:
the contrast between a geminate and a singleton may be
the only way in which words are distinguished (as, e.g.,
in the fatto/fato case), whereas segment location can be signaled in other ways (e.g., via cues to the location of neighboring segments). Second, and more interestingly, it
appears that consonant duration in Italian is not used as
a binary or categorical cue to the geminate/singleton distinction. Instead, as in other languages (e.g., Gow et al.,
1995), graded differences in consonant duration appear
to modulate word recognition in Italian.
These conclusions may seem to be at odds with the idea
that there are no prominent junctural phenomena in Italian
(Bertinetto, 1981) and that only emphatic realizations can
distinguish pairs like ``diversi/di versi", ``diverse/of verses",
and ``allargo/al largo", ``[I] enlarge/in the offing" (Bertinetto,
1981; Tabossi, Burani, & Scott, 1995). In his seminal study,
Bertinetto (1981) asked participants to make forced-choice
identifications of minimal pairs. The use of a task which requires meta-linguistic judgements may be why Bertinetto
failed to detect reliable discrimination effects. Using an online methodology, Tabossi et al. (1995) observed that re-

sponses to visual targets like PARENTI (e.g., relatives) were
facilitated after hearing an associate (e.g., visite, ``visits"),
even when this associate was realized as a spurious lexical
embedding (e.g., in visi te[diati], ``faces bored"). This suggests
that unintended words, even those straddling word boundaries, are temporarily considered during word recognition,
and hence that, in Italian, cues that signal word boundaries
are not reliably present at every word boundary. Similarly
to Tabossi et al., we found reliable priming from words spanning word boundaries, both for targets with geminates after
primes with lexical and false geminates, and for targets with
singletons after primes with medial and initial singletons.
For example, upon hearing la la (from la ladra) listeners appeared to entertain the parsing l'alano. But we used repetition priming, which provides a more sensitive measure
than associative priming of the lexical hypotheses which
are being considered by the listener (Donselaar et al.,
2005; Norris, Cutler, McQueen, & Butterfield, 2006). We
could therefore also observe the effect of positional contrasts in the recognition of words with singletons. For instance, the recognition of alano was more facilitated by a
fragment containing a medial singleton (l'ala from l'alano)
than by a fragment with an initial singleton (la la from la ladra). The present data therefore do not contradict those of
Tabossi et al. (1995). Instead, they extend those findings
by showing that, with a more sensitive measure, it is possible to observe that Italian listeners are able to use fine phonetic details in lexical access. Such details seem not strong
enough to block access of unintended words (e.g., visite in
visi tediati), but can nevertheless modulate recognition.
A further difference in degree of sensitivity to consonant
duration is that the positional effect was stronger for singletons than for geminates. Specifically, although there were
effects of differences in geminate duration in the regression
analyses, no such effects were found in the factorial analyses. In contrast, there was an effect of singleton duration
(stronger priming from shorter medial singleton primes
than from longer initial singleton primes) in the factorial
analysis in Experiment 3 (at least for the low-frequency targets). There are at least two reasons why positional effects
are more likely to surface for singletons than for geminates.
First, the durational contrast is proportionally larger for the
singletons (see Table 1). Although in absolute terms the initial/medial singleton and true/false geminate differences
are both very small, because singletons are overall so much
shorter than geminates, the former difference is proportionally almost twice that of the latter difference.
The second (potentially complementary) reason is that
singleton duration may have greater informational value
than geminate duration. Previous studies suggest that the
influence of phonetic detail depends on the informational
value that the details have for word discrimination in a given language (Ernestus & Mak, 2004; van Alphen & McQueen, 2006; Wagner et al., 2006). We have suggested that
the geminate/singleton contrast in Italian may have greater informational value than differences within either of the
two consonant classes. But positional differences within
singletons may in turn be more important than those within geminates. For singletons, the contrast concerns restricted and unrestricted consonants, but for geminates it
concerns only unrestricted consonants. It may thus be

more useful for Italians to pay attention to subtle differences in singleton duration than in geminate duration.
The final difference in sensitivity to durational differences
that we observed is the one just mentioned: while there were
effects for all types of singleton consonant, there were effects
for unrestricted but not restricted geminates. Effects in
Experiment 2 were necessarily limited to unrestricted consonants (because we included a false geminate condition
only unrestricted consonants were tested). But in Experiments 1 and 4, effects of consonant duration on the recognition of words with geminates were found to be limited to the
unrestricted consonants. It would appear that when a restricted geminate consonant is heard, its precise duration is
uninformative. Such a consonant can only be a lexical geminate; it cannot be a false geminate. Thus, once it has been
identified as a geminate (i.e., as not a singleton), its location
(in word-medial position) is also determined, and subtle
durational differences are not informative. In contrast, an
unrestricted geminate could either be word internal (a true,
lexical geminate) or at a word boundary (a false geminate). It
appears that subtle durational differences are then relevant,
and modulate word recognition accordingly.
This last differential effect is important for our claim
that consonant duration serves two functions in Italian
word recognition: segment identification (``what") and lexical segmentation (``where"). One might argue that our
findings concern only segment identification. Might it not
be the case that Italian consonant duration signals only
whether the consonant is a geminate or a singleton, but
in a graded fashion? The results of Experiment 3 suggest
that this is not the case for singletons. The few milliseconds
of difference between the initial and medial singletons
must be seen as subphonemic variation: the same singleton consonant (indeed, the same syllable-initial allophone)
should be identified in both cases. What does differ, in a
systematic way, is the likely location of those consonants.
It seems reasonable to conclude that the positional differences in Italian singletons serve the purpose of lexical segmentation by indicating (in a probabilistic manner) where
word boundaries are (or are not) likely to occur.
The case for the geminates, however, is at first glance less
convincing. One could make the argument that there is a
segmental distinction between true and false geminates
(at least an allophonic distinction). Specifically, perhaps lexical geminates are fundamentally different phonological
units from those that arise at word boundaries as a result
of post-lexical continuous speech production processes.
On this view, differences in geminate duration could be seen
as providing different degrees of support for (true) geminate
consonants: longer consonants might simply be better
geminates. But if this were the case, one would expect, contrary to what we observed, that both restricted and unrestricted consonants would be better geminates if they
were longer. The fact that the durational effects for geminates were limited to the unrestricted consonants (i.e., those
that can occur as false geminates) therefore suggests that
what we are dealing with here is a single class of geminates
(false and true alike), and that, as with the singletons, durational differences matter when they signal segment location
(i.e., a false geminate at a boundary vs. a true word-medial
geminate).

Statistical techniques
The results of the mixed-effects modeling analyses were
presented alongside those of more traditional analyses.
With the exception of the positional effect in Experiment
3, the analyses revealed the same patterns. This parallelism
is reassuring with respect to the hopefully cumulative nature of psycholinguistic research. As mixed-effect modeling
becomes more common, one concern might be that results
based on those techniques cannot be compared with those
based on traditional techniques. The present comparison
suggests that this concern is unfounded. It also shows what
the benefits of mixed-effect modeling are. Because multiple
sources of variance can be included in the analysis it is possible to observe effects that would be lost in traditional averaging. In the present case, these were effects involving target
frequency. The modeling repeatedly detected frequency effects, and in Experiments 1 and 3 frequency interacted with
the priming effect. Frequency has a strong impact on lexical
decisions (Forster & Chambers, 1973; Luce & Pisoni, 1998)
and the observation that the advantage of repetition priming
may vanish as frequency increases has often been reported
(e.g., Duchek & Neely, 1989; Forster & Davis, 1984; Norris,
1984; Rajaram & Neely, 1992). The frequency interaction
in the present data would likely not have been investigated
in an analysis that was based on the assumption of satisfactory counter-balancing of items and the use of averaged
scores. Mixed-effect modeling, however, allowed us to include these effects, with the advantage that we could then
detect priming effects that otherwise would have been
passed over. In particular, failure to detect an effect of singleton duration in Experiment 3 would have led to different
conclusions.
What and where in Italian speech comprehension
Consonant duration thus appears to serve both ``what"
and ``where" functions in Italian speech recognition. This
conclusion is in line with the parallel-processing proposal
of Cho et al. (2007). According to that account, information
relevant for phonemic contrasts is used to specify the speech
signal's segmental content, while, in parallel, information
relevant for suprasegmental structures is used to specify
the signal's prosodic and intonational content. Segmental
analysis could be accomplished using phonemic representations as, for instance, in Shortlist B (Norris & McQueen, 2008)
and TRACE (McClelland & Elman, 1986). Suprasegmental
analysis is considered to be achieved by a ``Prosody Analyzer". These two processes, though separate, are considered
to be interdependent. Some aspects of the suprasegmental
analysis should be informed by the segmental analyses
(e.g., ``determination of durational cues to prosodic structure could depend on knowledge about the intrinsic duration of specific segments," Cho et al., 2007, p. 234).
In the case of Italian consonants, duration could be used,
probabilistically, in the segmental analysis process. Longer
consonants would tend to increase support for geminates
(and hence for words containing geminates), and shorter
consonants would tend to increase support for singletons
(and hence for words containing singletons). But duration
would also influence suprasegmental analysis (i.e., the oper-

321

ation of the Prosody Analyzer), which, together with input
from segmental analysis about segmental identity, could
specify whether a given consonant (geminate or singleton)
is more likely to be initial or medial. This information about
the location of likely word boundaries, through the operation of the PWC (Norris et al., 1997), could then influence
the competition process which underlies word recognition
and lexical segmentation.
The relative strength of the positional effect for different sets of consonants supports the hypothesized interdependence of the segmental and suprasegmental processes.
For instance, positional effects for singletons tend to be
stronger than those for geminates since the location of
word boundaries tends to be more informative for words
with singletons than for words with geminates. In particular, for a word with a restricted geminate, segmental analysis would strongly constrain the lexical search, with little
room for an additional role for the Prosody Analyzer. Similarly, variation in the duration of a singleton will tend to
have little effect on the recognition of words with geminates. But variation in unrestricted geminate duration
influences the recognition of words with unrestricted
geminates, and variation in singleton duration influences
recognition of words with singletons because in both of
these cases the Prosody Analyzer has a greater role to play.
This study could well have revealed that consonant
duration in Italian influences only segmental identification
(i.e., that it has only a ``what" function). But this is not what
was found. In spite of its importance for geminate/singleton ``what" decisions, consonant duration also has a (more
constrained) ``where" function in Italian. Our proposal,
therefore, is that the word-recognition system is tuned to
the relevance, in particular languages, of specific phonetic
details not only for word discrimination but also for lexical
segmentation.
