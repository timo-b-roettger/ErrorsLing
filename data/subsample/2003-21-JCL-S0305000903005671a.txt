ABSTRACT

This study examined (a) developmental stability and change in children's
private speech during the preschool years, (b) across-task consistency
in children's self-speech, and (c) across-setting relations between
children's private speech in the laboratory and their behaviour at
home and in the preschool classroom. A group of 32 normally developing
three- and four-year-old children was observed twice (six month interobservation interval) while engaging in the same individual problemsolving tasks. Measures of private speech were collected from
transcribed videotapes. Naturalistic observations of children's behaviour in the preschool classroom were conducted, and teachers and
parents reported on children's behaviour at home and school. Individual

differences in preschool children's private speech use were generally
stable across tasks and time and related to children's observed and
reported behaviour at school and home. Children whose private speech
was more partially internalized had fewer externalizing behaviour
problems and better social skills as reported by parents and teachers.
Children whose private speech was largely task-irrelevant engaged in
less goal-directed behaviour in the classroom, expressed more negative
affect in the classroom, and rated as having poorer social skills and
more behaviour problems. Developmental change occurred during the
preschool years in children's use and internalization of private speech
during problem-solving in the form of a reduction over time in the total
number of social speech utterances, a decrease in the average number of
words per utterance, and an increase in the proportion of private speech
that was partially internalized.

INTRODUCTION

An interesting development that takes place during the preschool years is
children's use and internalization of private speech, or self-talk (Diaz & Berk,
1992). Simply put, young children often talk to themselves aloud as they go
about their daily activities. From the Vygotskian sociocultural perspective,
which has guided most of the research in this area, children's private speech
is seen as a manifestation and intermediate step of a process of language
internalization - whereby language, a cultural tool first used for communication with others, comes to be used by the child as an intrapsychological tool
for regulating thought and behaviour (Vygotsky, 1934/1962, 1930-1935/
1978 ; Berk, 1992 ; Berk & Winsler, 1995). According to Vygotskian theory,
it is the merging of language and cognition in the form of children's
early private speech that transforms children's minds and allows for the
development of higher, uniquely-human, psychological functions, such as
planning, executive functioning, and behavioural self-regulation. According
to Vygotsky, it is through language that children become masters of their own
behaviour (Vygotsky, 1934/1962, 1930-1935/1978). Thus, private speech,
from this perspective, is thought to play a role in the development of
children's behavioural self-control and self-regulation.
Researchers have explored a variety of different aspects of children's
private speech, including its ontogenetic (Kohlberg, Yaeger & Hjertholm,
1968 ; Berk, 1986; Bivens & Berk, 1990 ; Manning & White, 1990 ; Winsler,
Diaz, Atencio, McCarthy & Adams Chabay, 2000) and microgenetic developmental course (Berk & Spuhl, 1995 ; Duncan & Pratt, 1997), relations with
children's task performance and on-task behaviour (Berk, 1986 ; Behrend,
Rosengren & Perlmutter, 1989 ; Winsler, Diaz & Montero, 1997), social
influences on self-talk (Berk & Spuhl, 1995; Lee, 1999 ; Winsler, Diaz,
584

PRIVATE SPEECH

Atencio, McCarthy & Adams Chabay, 1999), task and setting influences on
such speech (Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985; Winsler & Diaz, 1995 ; Krafft &
Berk, 1998; Lee, 1999 ; Winsler, Carlton & Barry, 2000), and its use among
children with behaviour, learning, and/or attention problems (Berk & Potts,
1991 ; Berk & Landau, 1993 ; Winsler, 1998). In terms of the developmental
course for private speech, researchers have shown an overall ontogenetic
pattern of children's overt self-talk rising to a peak in the preschool years and
gradually being replaced by partially internalized whispers and inaudible
muttering, and silent ` inner' verbal thought, or inner speech, as children
progress through early elementary school (Kohlberg et al., 1968 ; Berk, 1986 ;
Bivens & Berk, 1990 ; Manning & White, 1990 ; Winsler et al., 2000).
Researchers have also noted a similar transition from externalized to partially
internalized private speech microgenetically, as children develop competence
in a single task with repeated trials over time (Berk & Spuhl, 1995 ; Duncan
& Pratt, 1997).
It is important to note in this regard, however, that our current understanding of early developmental trajectories for children's private speech is
limited for a number of reasons. First, practically all of the studies exploring
age trends in children's private speech to date have been cross-sectional
rather than longitudinal (for notable exceptions, see Bivens & Berk, 1990 ;
Winsler et al., 2000). Second these studies have typically focused on
early elementary school-aged children (Kohlberg et al., 1968; Berk, 1986 ;
Bivens & Berk, 1990 ; Manning & White, 1990), rather than children in the
preschool period. Finally, much of the limited longitudinal work that has been
conducted has focused on microgenetic changes in private speech over short
periods of time during repeated trials of a task (Berk & Spuhl, 1995 ; Duncan
& Pratt, 1997). Thus, although Vygotskian theory predicts that children's
private speech should become more task-relevant, self-regulatory, and more
internalized between the ages of 3; 0 and 5; 0, we have limited longitudinal
data on this age period. Such a lack of developmental data on children's
private speech during the preschool period is particularly unfortunate given
that a) this is the age period in which major developments take place in the
emergence of children's self-regulatory skills (Kopp, 1982 ; Campbell, 1997 ;
Bronson, 2000), and b) language mediation, likely in the form of private
speech, is generally thought to play an important role in the development
of behavioural self-control and self-regulation (Luria, 1961 ; Kopp, 1982 ;
Balamore & Wozniak, 1984 ; Berk & Winsler, 1995; Nelson, 1996 ; Campbell,
1997). Thus, a major goal of the present study was to assess short-term
(6-month) developmental change in children's private speech between the
ages of 3; 0 and 5; 0.
Researchers have found evidence for hypothesized links between children's
private speech and behavioural self-regulation in a number of different ways.
First, children's private speech has been observed to serve self-regulatory
585

W I N S L E R E T A L.

or self-guiding functions for children while engaged in specific cognitive
problem-solving activities (Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985; Berk, 1986 ; Lee,
1999). Second, children's private speech appears systematically during
moments of increased task difficulty and settings with a high demand for
self-regulation (Behrend et al., 1989 ; Winsler & Diaz, 1995). Further, selftalk has been shown to be positively and dynamically related to gains in
children's task performance over time (Diaz, 1992 ; Berk & Spuhl, 1995 ;
Winsler et al., 1997). Finally, children with problems of self-regulation and
behavioural control (i.e. children either diagnosed with ADHD/LD or
youngsters seen by their teachers as impulsive/hard-to-manage) appear to
rely more on private speech and be delayed in speech internalization (Berk &
Potts, 1991 ; Diaz, Winsler, Atencio & Harbers, 1992 ; Berk & Landau, 1993 ;
Winsler, 1998 ; Winsler et al., 1999) compared to children without such
behaviour problems.
The work cited above, however, has only either explored speech-
performance relations during specific cognitive problem-solving tasks or
made global group difference contrasts in children's speech to self (i.e.
ADHD/impulsive groups vs. comparison groups). Additional evidence of
the role of private speech in children's behaviour regulation would come
from investigation of the extent to which individual differences in children's
private speech use in the laboratory setting are associated with variation in
children's behaviour and behavioural control in the naturalistic setting of the
preschool classroom. If private speech is indeed an important mediator for
the emergence of children's behavioural control during early childhood, then
one would expect to see children's use and internalization of such speech to
be related to their behaviour in the school and home setting. Thus, a second
goal of the present study was to explore associations between children's use
of private speech in the laboratory and the quality of their behaviour in the
classroom (as reported by the teachers and as independently observed in
the classroom) and at home (as reported by parents) with a normative sample
of preschool children.
The qualities of children's behaviour assessed by the classroom observations conducted in this study included children's goal-directed/on-task
behaviour, sustained attention to activities, and affect expression in the
classroom. The effective organization of behaviour towards the attainment of
particular goals is a classic and central component of human self-regulatory
and/or executive functioning (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994 ; Heckhausen &
Dweck, 1998 ; Zelazo, Astington & Olson, 1999; Bronson, 2000). Thus, the
extent to which children's behaviour appeared focused on the attainment of
particular, salient goals, either formulated by the teacher/classroom context
(on-task) or by the child (if sanctioned by the teacher/classroom context) was
taken in this study as evidence of healthy self-regulatory functioning in the
classroom. Being able to maintain and control one's attention on a particular
586

PRIVATE SPEECH

behaviour/activity, especially in the presence of multiple distractions, is
also a central feature of self-regulated behaviour (Milich & Loney, 1986 ;
Eisenberg, Guthrie, Fabes, Shepard, Losoya, Murphy, Jones, Poulin &
Reiser, 2000 ; Sethi, Mischel, Aber, Shoda & Rodriguez, 2000). Thus,
sustained attention, or the extent to which the child remains engaged in the
same activity over time, was also measured here and taken as evidence of
healthy self-regulatory functioning in the classroom. Further, emotional
regulation in the form of modulating one's expression of positive and negative
emotions, is another component of children's effective behavioural regulation
(Eisenberg, Fabes, Bernzweig, Karbon, Poulin & Hanish, 1993; Denham,
1998). Children's expressed affect in the classroom was, thus, also measured.
The present study fills another curious gap in the research literature on
children's private speech in that although much has been learned about
young children's self-talk, it is quite surprising that basic psychometric
information about such issues as test-retest reliability/stability and acrosstask generalizability of private speech has never been systematically
documented. Little information exists, for example, about whether individual differences in the quality and quantity of children's private speech remain
stable over time, or about the extent to which patterns of children's private
speech usage are consistent across multiple tasks or settings. There have been
numerous investigations demonstrating that the content and frequency of
children's private speech can be affected by different features of either the
task or the contextual setting (Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985 ; Berk & Landau,
1993 ; Winsler & Diaz, 1995 ; Krafft & Berk, 1998 ; Lee, 1999 ; Winsler et al.,
1999), but the focus of these investigations has been on establishing task
effects, rather than exploring SIMILARITIES or stable individual differences
across tasks in children's quality and quantity of private speech. Part of the
reason for a lack of attention to individual differences in children's private
speech use is that most of the Vygotskian-inspired private speech research
has appropriately come from a microgenetic, speech-in-a-particular-context
perspective. However, it is certainly possible to have both stable individual
differences over time and both contextual and microgenetic (trial-by-trial)
variance in developmental phenomena.
Olszewski (1987) examined the stability and correlates of individual
differences in one specific type of young children's self-talk, verbal fantasy
play, and found high stability across occasions in the quantity of imaginative
verbal play produced by children. She also found negative associations
between amount of verbal fantasy play and children's social participation in
preschool classrooms. Verbal fantasy play, however, represents a distinct
type of children's self-talk, seen as serving different functions for children
and being somewhat different from the self-guiding and self-regulatory type
of private speech used by children during problem-solving activities (Berk &
Winsler, 1995) that is the focus of the present investigation (and most others
587

W I N S L E R E T A L.

studies in the area as well). Thus, among the goals of this study was to
determine the across-task consistency and short term (6 months) stability
of several speech measures/variables that have been used in the literature.
Overview
A group of 32 normally developing preschool children was observed twice
(T1, T2 - six-month inter-observation interval) while engaging in two
individual problem-solving tasks. Measures of private speech were collected
from transcribed videotapes. Naturalistic observations of children's behaviour in the preschool classroom were conducted, and teachers and parents
reported on children's behaviour at school and home. The goals of the
present study were : (1) to assess the across-task consistency in children's
private speech use in the laboratory, (2) to assess both stability of individual
differences and change over time (6 months) in children's private speech, and
(3) to explore relations between individual differences in children's private
speech use in the laboratory and children's behavioural control at home and
at school. Given that our Vygotskian theoretical framework sees private
speech as not just moment-to-moment articulation of ongoing thought
processes during task-specific problem-solving, but instead a coherent set of
verbal self-regulatory strategies that have developed over time into an organized way of guiding one's behaviour, we expected relatively high reliability/
consistency of children's private speech use across tasks even in the presence
of possible task effects, and moderate six-month stability. At the same time,
we expected to see significant ontogenetic change, with private speech
becoming less overt and more internalized over time during the preschool
years. Further, we hypothesized that individual differences in children's
private speech in the laboratory would be related to their behaviour in both
the school and home setting. More specifically, children whose private
speech was more covert/internalized and less irrelevant were expected to
demonstrate more goal-directed activity, greater sustained attention, more
social competence, and fewer externalizing behaviour problems (acting out,
disruptive/aggressive behaviour) than children whose speech was characterized by more overt, and task-irrelevant forms.

METHOD

Participants
Participants included 32 preschool children attending a university-affiliated
child development centre in a medium-sized city in the southeastern United
States. Half of the sample consisted of all 16 children enrolled in the `threeyear-old room ' at the preschool (50% male). The other 16 children (44 %
male) comprised the ` four-year-old room ' at the centre. The ages for the
588

PRIVATE SPEECH

` three-year-olds ' at T1 data collection during the fall semester ranged from
3;1 to 4; 0 (M=3; 7; 18), and at T2 data collection in the spring semester, this
group ranged in age from 3; 7 to 4; 7 (M=4; 2). The ages for the four-yearold children at T1 ranged from 4; 1 to 5; 0 (M=4;7;3), and at T2 this group
ranged in age from 4; 6 to 5; 5 (M=4; 11; 21). The ethnic breakdown of
the sample according to parental report on the preschool registration forms
was 75 % Caucasian, 11% African-American, and 14 % Asian-American. A
reasonable range of family socioeconomic levels was present in the sample
(Hollingshead index - Range=31-66, M=51.53, S.D.=10.31) since the
preschool stratified its enrollment in the classrooms into three equal thirds :
a) children of university faculty/staff, b) children of university students,
and c) children of community members. The average paternal age was
36 years (S.D.=6) and maternal age was 33 years (S.D.=5). Fathers' years of
education ranged from 13 to 21 years (M=17.44, S.D.=2.72) and mothers'
education ranged from 12 to 21 years (M=16.65, S.D.=2.36). None of
the demographic variables varied significantly by children's age group. The
number of participants reported in the analyses below varies slightly due
to occasional technical difficulties with the camera, participant refusal to
participate in tasks, and participant attrition (e.g. five children were no longer
at the centre at T2).
Classroom setting
The participating preschool programme was a relatively high quality,
fully-accredited (by the National Association for the Education of Young
Children), five-day-a-week, morning (8 : 00 am-12 :00 pm) programme,
consisting of one three-year-old class and one four-year-old class. Both classrooms were headed by one lead teacher and one graduate student assistant
(all female). The two classrooms shared the same teaching philosophy and
had similar daily schedules which reliably consisted of certain times each day
set aside for three different types of activities : 1) self-selected activities, in
which children would choose to which of several activity centres (i.e. block
area, house corner, Lego1 table, dress-up area _) they would go to play,
2) outside play time, and 3) large group activities, such as circle time, reading,
or singing, together as a group.
Procedures
Children were videotaped as they completed tasks in a separate testing/
meeting room at the preschool with a male graduate student experimenter
for a total of four, 30-45-minute sessions ; two sessions at T1 (September-
October) and two sessions (identical to T1) at T2 (March-April). A high
quality omnidirectional table microphone (Realistic PZM) was used as the
589

W I N S L E R E T A L.

audio input to the videos in order to insure quality speech recordings.
The video camera was mounted on a tripod approximately 12 feet away
from the child facing the child's front as s/he was seated in front of a table
with the task materials. The experimenter sat next to the child at the table
during the instruction/collaborative parts of the tasks and moved his
chair over to the side end of the table and looked away during the individual
parts of the tasks. The average time interval between the two sessions
for children within T1 and T2 data collection phases was one week. During
each session, children completed one problem-solving task in a fixed order
with the first session consisting of the Selective Attention (SA) task and the
second session consisted of the Lego1 Construction (LC) task. Finally,
naturalistic observations of the children in the classroom were conducted
over the course of the spring semester, and parent- and teacher-ratings of
child social skills and behaviour problems were collected towards the end of
the school year.

Tasks/measures
Problem-solving tasks. Children were asked to complete two problemsolving tasks twice (T1 and T2) for the primary purpose of eliciting
children's private speech. The first was a selective attention (SA) task which
has been used extensively in the private speech literature (Diaz et al., 1992 ;
Winsler et al., 1997 ; Winsler, 1998) and has been found to be interesting
and appropriately challenging for preschoolers and because it is effective in
eliciting children's private speech. In this task, children first determine which
dimension (either form or colour) is shared by two pictures on a card and
then they attach with Velcro a third picture that represents the dimension
shared by the other two. For example, a card might have a picture of a green
flower and one of a red flower. Here, the correct response would be for the
child to select and attach the card that is the colourless flower. The correct
dimension (colour or form) varies randomly across the 12 items with three
forms (car, flower, dog) and three colours (blue, yellow, orange) possible.
Included in the answer box are 18 cards each representing one of six possible
answers. The experimenter introduced the task, assisted the child with
two example items, asked the child to try to finish the remaining 12 items
individually, and increased the seating distance between the experimenter
and child for the remainder of the items.
The second problem-solving activity was a lego-construction (LC) task
in which children attempted to reproduce a Lego structure according to
an accessible three-dimensional model. Variants of this task have been
used successfully in previous private speech research with young children
(Berk & Spuhl, 1995 ; Winsler et al., 1999). Children first completed the
27-piece model of a robot together with the assistance of the experimenter
590

PRIVATE SPEECH

and then the child was asked to construct the robot individually, with the
experimenter moving to the other end of the room. The tasks were the same
at T2.
Parent- and teacher-report of children's behaviour. Parents and teachers
completed the Preschool and Kindergarten Behaviour Scales (PKBS ;
Merrell, 1994). Overall scale scores for children's externalizing behaviour
problems and social skills were used.
Classroom observations. A total of 2752 time-sampled naturalistic observations of children's on-task behaviour, sustained activity, and affect in the
preschool classrooms were conducted. Observations were carried out over
a 10-week period during the spring semester of the academic year. Two
female research assistants (one per classroom) observed children according
to a predetermined random order. Observations began after a three-week
introductory period during which time children grew accustomed to the
presence of the observers in the classroom, observers were trained, the
observational checklist instrument was pilot tested, and the reliability of
the final observational checklist instrument was established. Observer
influence effects were minimized in this study by both the presence of
the three-week, rapport-building period and by the fact that children in
these classrooms were generally quite accustomed to the presence of
observers in the classroom given the centre's laboratory responsibilities.
Observations took place throughout the entire preschool morning which
typically included all three types of classroom activity settings (discussed
above). Each child was observed an average of 98 times yielding a total of
2752 observations.
Observers, unaware of the research hypotheses, used a behavioural observation checklist instrument to record their observations. Also, to assist in
adhering to the time-sampling observation schedule, observers listened to
pre-recorded time signals which projected via headphones to one ear from an
audiocassette recorder attached to her belt. Target children were observed
for approximately ten, 10-minute periods, with each period consisting of ten,
10-second direct observation intervals separated by 50-second recording
intervals. Thus, an observer would observe a target child for 10 seconds, at
which time the audio signal would sound and she would then record her
observations for that 10-second period on the checklist instrument for the
remainder of the minute. Then the audio signal would sound again indicating
that it was time to observe the child again for the second, ten-second observation. This pattern would continue for ten observations at which time the
observer would go on to conduct a series of ten observations on the next
child on the list. Predominant activity sampling (PAS; Hutt & Hutt, 1970)
was used for the social context and activity variables, meaning that if more
than one type of behavioural class occurred within a 10-second observation
interval, observers coded the occurrence of only the predominant behaviour
591

W I N S L E R E T A L.

that was present for the larger time period during the observation. The
following variables were coded on the observational checklist instrument.
The variables used in the analyses below were the overall proportion of the
child's observations over the entire semester that the particular behaviour or
code was present.
First, children's ACTIVITY was coded as being either explicitly goaldirected or non goal-directed. Goal-directed activity was defined as behaviour by the child which appeared focused, organized, and had a tangible goal
or end point to the activity. The goal being pursued by the child could either
be self-formulated or teacher-provided. Examples of goal-directed activity
included building a structure out of Legos or some other assembly/
construction materials, doing a puzzle, playing a game with rules, or
engaging in an organized make-believe episode of `house '. Not explicitly
goal-directed behaviour included, for example, aimless wandering around
the classroom and/or repeatedly spinning a puzzle piece around one's finger
for the apparent ` fun of it '. Children's SUSTAINED ACTIVITY was coded by
assessing the relationship between the child's activity during the current
ten-second observation interval and the child's activity during the previous
observation period, one minute ago. For the second through tenth observation in each series of 10 observations on target children, the observer coded
whether or not the activity the target child was engaged in during the current
observation was the same (in terms of goal, materials, and behaviour) as
that in which the child was engaged during the previous observation one
minute ago.
Children's AFFECT (positive, negative, neutral) was also coded during the
observations. Positive affect was coded if children exhibited any overt smiles
or laughter during the observation. Negative affect was coded if frowning,
crying, yelling, pouting or explicit facial expressions of anger were present.
Neutral affect was coded if the child's affect during the 10 seconds was
neither positive nor negative.
Laboratory private speech. Children's private speech during the laboratory
tasks (SA and LC) was transcribed from the videotapes by research assistants
naive to study hypotheses, and transcripts were later independently verified/
corrected by another person. As is typical in private speech research, the
unit of analysis was the utterance, defined as either a complete sentence,
a sentence fragment or clause with intentional markers of termination, a
conversational turn, or any string of speech which is temporally separated
from another by at least three seconds (Winsler, 1998). Child speech utterances
were classified as either social or private, with private speech being defined as
any verbalization by the child which was not explicitly addressed to another
person, as indicated by either a pronoun reference, a gaze to another person,
or other signals of social intent, such as physical contact, argumentation,
repetition, loudness/intonation, or conversational turn-taking (Winsler,
592

PRIVATE SPEECH

1998). Because we would be providing fundamental psychometric information about across-task consistency and test-retest reliability, we decided
to code each utterance for several different aspects of children's private
speech in order to be reflective of the types of self speech variables and
metrics that are used in the literature.
Private speech utterances during problem-solving were classified according
to Laura Berk's (1986) coding system which categorizes children's private
speech utterances on the basis of overtness (volume) and task-relevance
and consists of three broad categories. Level 1, task-irrelevant private
speech, includes word play, affect expressions, comments to imaginary
others, and other utterances which appear unrelated to the task at hand.
Level II, overt (regular volume) task-relevant private speech, includes statements about the task or the child's ongoing or future task-related activity.
Level III, partially internalized private speech, includes inaudible muttering, whispers, and silent, verbal lip movements. To control for differences in
the amount of time children took to complete the task, number of utterances
per minute was calculated for each of the private speech categories and
total private speech. Overall number of social speech utterances per minute
was also calculated. In addition to raw number of utterances in each level,
utterances per minute, and the proportion of the child's total private speech
that was made up from each level, was calculated.
A second category system based on the SEMANTIC CONTENT/FUNCTION of
the private speech was also used (adapted from Diaz et al., 1992 ; Winsler,
1998). Each private speech utterance by the child was placed into one of
the following 10 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories, based on
speech content : (1) Exclamations - typically one word expressions of affect
or expletives (e.g. ` Oh ! ' ` Oops! ', (2) Nonwords - sound effects, wordplay,
humming (e.g. ` Hmmm', ` Vroom' - explosion noises), (3) Descriptions of
the self - statements about the child's state or behaviour (e.g. `I'm looking for
blue ', ` I found a fish ', ` I'm hungry '), (4) Descriptions of the environment/
task - statements about the child's surroundings or the task (e.g. ` They 're
the same colour ', ` A blue one ', ` It's hot in here '), (5) Evaluative or motivational statements - statements about the child's ability, performance, or
motivation ; self-reinforcement or deprecation ; evaluation of the task (e.g.
` I did it ! ', ` I'm good at this ', ` Good ', ` This is easy '), (6) Plans/hypothetical
reasoning - planning or future-oriented statements; if-then constructions
(e.g. ` I need a purple one', ` I'll do this first', `If I put this here _ '), (7)
Commands to the self - explicit instructions to the self with imperative verb
(e.g. ` Pick them up ! ', ` Don't put that one ', ` Get one more '), (8) Questions/
answers - questions addressed to the self or clear answers to one's own
questions (e.g. ` Which one should I put next ?', `This one ', `Where's
the blue? ', ` Is that right ?', ` Yes '), (9) Transitional statements - reflective
utterances which had to do with ending one activity and starting another

(e.g. ` So', ` Then', ` Next', ` OK '), and (10) Other - any utterance which
could not be placed in one of the above categories. To reduce the total
number of dependent variables explored, only the raw number of each of
these types of private speech utterances was calculated and used in the
analyses.
Further coding of children's private speech explored selected linguistic
and syntactic features of the speech (Feigenbaum, 1992). Each private speech
utterance was categorized as being either complete or fragmented. An
utterance was defined as complete if it were grammatically intact in that it
contained both a subject (explicit or implied, as in the imperative) and a
predicate. Complete utterances also included one word questions, answers,
and imperatives to the self. Examples of utterances coded as complete
include ` This goes here ', ` Where does this go ?', `I need a three', `How? '
and ` I see'. Grammatically incorrect or incomplete utterances were coded as
fragmented, such as ` This one ', ` Over here ', `Blue ', `Where is the _ ? ',
` But ', ` Six more' and ` The red one on top of the yellow'. From this, the
percentage of the child's private speech utterances that was fragmented was
calculated. Finally, also calculated were (a) the mean length of each private
speech utterance - the mean number of words per utterance, (b) the total raw
number of private speech utterances emitted, (c) the total number of private
speech utterances per minute, and (d) the proportion of all children's speech
that was private.
Reliability. Inter-rater reliability for the classroom observations was
determined during the last phases of observer training, at which time two
observers independently rated the same children for 257 10-second observations. Reliability was acceptable to good for all category systems. Percentage
agreement across observers was 88 % for children's activity (Kappa=0.75),
96 % for sustained activity (Kappa=0.90), and 87% for affect (Kappa=0.71).
Inter-rater reliability for the private speech coding systems was estimated by
having two naive research assistants independently code a randomly-selected
subset of the transcripts. Percentage agreement for the distinction between
social and private speech (on a subsample of 17% of the transcripts) was
94 % (Kappa=0.87), for the fragmented vs. complete distinction 85 %
(Kappa=0.70), for the ten content category speech coding system (on a 20 %
subsample) 89 % (Kappa=0.83), and for the three Level (I, II, III) system,
95 % (Kappa=0.88).

To give the reader a sense of the qualitative nature of the child private speech
data, we first present two excerpts from the transcripts of two four-year-olds,

Across-task consistency of private speech
To determine whether children use private speech in similar ways across the
two different problem-solving tasks, Spearman correlations were calculated
on all of the private speech variables across the two tasks at T1. Table 1
provides these correlations as well as means (and standard deviations) for all
of the speech variables, and flags indicating in which cases repeated measures
ANOVAs revealed mean differences in children's private speech by task. As
seen in the table, for practically every private speech variable, correlations
across the two tasks are strong, positive, and statistically significant (r's from

0.39 to 0.73), indicating that children who used a lot of one particular type of
private speech category during one task (relative to the other children in the
sample) tended to do the same on the other task as well. Although the
proportion of children's private speech that was made up of the partially
internalized type (whispers and muttering) was reliable across the two tasks,
the other two proportional private speech variables and the overall proportion
of private speech to total speech measures were not as consistent across tasks
596

PRIVATE SPEECH

(r's from 0.02 to 0.33). Thus, the proportion of children's private speech that
is either task-relevant or irrelevant appears to vary somewhat by task, as also
indicated by the repeated-measures ANOVAs. Children's private speech was
proportionately more task-irrelevant during the Lego construction (LC) task
than during the selective attention (SA) task, F(1, 19)=5.28, p<0.05,
d (Cohen's effect size)=0.84. Children's private speech during the SA task
was more common in terms of overall utterances per minute (F(1, 23)=5.35,
p<0.05, d=0.49), contained more commands (F(1, 23)=4.37, p<0.05,
d=0.56), more questions to the self (F(1, 23)=5.23, p<0.05, d=0.51), and
more partially internalized forms of speech (F(1, 23)=5.56, p<0.05, d=0.62)
than speech during the LC task.
Thus, although certain tasks appear to be more likely to elicit particular
types of private speech in general, children overall tend to maintain their
relative ranks in terms of (a) the frequency with which they use different
types of private speech across tasks, (b) the extent to which the speech is
syntactically abbreviated, and (c) the proportion of children's private speech
which is partially internalized. Individual differences in children's use of
private speech are large (as indicated by the size of the standard deviations)
yet fairly stable across tasks. Given such consistency across the two tasks
in children's private speech usage, aggregate private speech measures, averaging across the two tasks, were calculated and used in all subsequent
analyses.

Stability of private speech over time
To assess six-month stability in different components of children's private
speech over the six-month period, Spearman correlations were calculated
using the aggregate (across-task) private speech variables from T1 and T2 for
all children combined. Table 2 presents these correlations, and the T1 and
T2 means (and standard deviations) for these variables. Stability of private
speech, in terms of children maintaining their relative ranks in the distributions from T1 to T2, was fairly strong (r's from 0.34 to 0.73) for most of
the private speech variables. The exceptions to this rule included partially
internalized private speech, the proportion of private speech irrelevant to the
task, the overall private speech to total speech proportion, and three of the
specific content categories (self descriptions, plans, and other), for which
little stability was demonstrated. Thus, individual quantitative and qualitative
differences in most indices of children's private speech appear to be not only
consistent across tasks settings, but also stable over a six-month period for
preschoolers age 3; 0 to 5; 0. The relative proportion of children's speech that
is self-directed, and partially internalized private speech in the form of
whispers and inaudible muttering, show greater interindividual variability
in their patterns of intraindividual change over time during the preschool

the means (and standard deviations) by age group for each of these components of private speech at T1 and T2. Overall, about 70 % of preschoolers'
speech was directed to the self. Although the proportion of private to total
speech was somewhat smaller (0.54) for the youngest age group at T1
(3 ; 7), no significant age effects, time effects, nor age-by-time interactions
emerged from the ANOVA. Social speech to the experimenter during the
task was found to vary systematically by age and time (age-by-time interaction F(1, 21)=4.70, p<0.05), with the three-year-olds significantly
reducing their amount of social speech from T1 to T2 (d=0.54) appearing at
the end to be more like the four-year olds at T1 and T2, whose social speech
utterances per minute were lower and more stable. A similar age-by-time
interaction was found for the average number of words per private speech
utterance used by the children during the problem-solving tasks,
F(1, 21)=4.20, p<0.05. Thus, although the elaborateness of both age
groups' private speech decreased from T1 to T2 (significant time F(1, 21)=
3.77, p<0.01, d=0.72), and three-year-olds' private speech utterances were
generally longer than those of four-year-olds (significant age F(1, 21)=12.73,
p<0.01, d=1.3), significantly greater decreases in the elaborateness of
children's private speech utterances occurred among the three-year-olds.
Overall, approximately 80-90% of children's private speech utterances
were syntactically fragmented (not containing both a subject and predicate)
and this proportion did not vary significantly by age group or time.
Interesting developmental changes were observed in the topography of
children's private speech in terms of its task relevance and partial internalization. Figure 1 shows how the proportion of children's private speech
that was made up of task-irrelevant (Level I), task-relevant (Level II), and
partially internalized (Level III) speech changes over time differentially for
the three- and four-year olds. Dashed lines between the ages of 4;2 and 4 ;7
are used in the figure to remind the reader that two different groups of children (three- and four-year-olds) were followed over two points in time rather
than one group over four time points. As seen in the figure, the majority
(69 %) of the youngest (3 ; 7) group's private speech was of the overt, taskrelevant type with the remaining 10 and 21% of their private speech being
made up of the partially internalized and task-irrelevant forms, respectively.
However, significant changes occur between the ages of 3 ;7 and 4 ;7 in
the composition of children's private speech, as the four-year-old group's
private speech at both 4; 7 and 5 ; 0 comprised approximately 60% partially
internalized whispers and muttering ; 30 % overt, task-relevant speech ; and
10 % overt speech irrelevant to the task. These patterns are confirmed by a
significant age-by-time interaction effect, F(1, 19)=5.79, p<0.01, and age
effect, F(1, 21)=16.08, p<0.001, d=1.4, for the proportion of children's
level III to total private speech, and by a significant age effect, F(1, 19)=
10.46, p<0.01, d=1.1, for the proportion of children's level II to total private

speech. Thus, children's private speech becomes increasingly internalized,
both in terms of shifts from overt to partially-covert speech and shifts to
more predicated and abbreviated forms of speech, from the age of 3;0 to 5; 5.
The biggest changes in children's private speech appear to occur for the
three-year-olds between the ages of 3; 7 (T1) and 4 ;2 (T2).
Relations between children's private speech and behaviour at home and school
A correlational analysis strategy was chosen to assess associations between
children's private speech in the laboratory and their behaviour at home and
school. However, given the age-related changes found above for children's
private speech and suspected age-related changes in children's behaviour
in the classroom and adult reports (see below), partial correlations (controlling for age) were conducted. Indeed, age was positively associated with
children's goal-directed activity in the classroom (r=0.42, p<0.05). Also,
teachers reported improved social skills (r=0.64, p<0.05) and fewer
externalizing behaviour problems (r=x0.42, p<0.05) for the older children
relative to younger children. Table 4 shows partial Pearson correlations
(controlling for age) between children's private speech use in the lab (overall,
averaged across tasks and time) and parent-reported problems at home and
both their observed and teacher-rated behaviour in the classroom. Given
the exploratory nature of this work and a desire not to ignore a substantial

effect size because of small sample sizes minimizing chances of statistical
significance, an alpha value of 0.10 was chosen for these analyses.
Overall, stable individual differences in children's private speech use were
associated with children's behaviour at home and at school. Children whose
private speech during the problem-solving tasks was proportionately more
internalized (e.g. contained a higher proportion of whispers and inaudible
muttering) were rated by parents and teachers as having better social skills
and rated by their teacher as having fewer externalizing behaviour problems
than children whose private speech was less internalized. Correspondingly,
children whose private speech consisted mostly of overt, full-volume taskrelevant speech were seen by parents as having poorer social skills. Also, high
proportions of overt relevant private speech were associated with increased
positive affect and decreased neutral affect displayed by the children in the
classroom.
Irrelevant, off-task private speech by children during problem-solving
in the lab was predictive of poor behaviour at home and school. Children
whose private speech was largely and proportionately more irrelevant to the
problem-solving task at hand a) spent significantly less time engaged in
goal-directed activities and exhibited more negative affect in the classroom,
b) were rated by their teachers and parents as having poorer social skills,
and c) rated by teachers as exhibiting greater behaviour problems than
children whose speech was more relevant and/or internalized.

PRIVATE SPEECH

In terms of the overall quantity of private speech emitted in the lab
(utterances per minute), children who talked to themselves a lot during the
problem-solving tasks exhibited more positive and less neutral affect in
the classroom, and were more likely to be perceived by their teachers as
having behaviour problems. Finally, children whose total speech during the
problem-solving tasks was proportionately more private (as compared to
social) were observed to sustain their attention longer during activities in
the classroom.1
DISCUSSION

Research on children's private speech has examined many different aspects of
children's self-talk (e.g. the semantic content and/or function of the speech,
its task-relevance, its degree of internalization [overt vs. partially internalized], syntactic abbreviation or fragmentation), using a variety of different
metrics (raw utterance counts, utterances per minute, proportion of total
speech or total private speech, ratio of social to private speech). One of the
aims of this study was to provide fundamental psychometric information on
the reliability or consistency of individual differences in children's private
speech use across tasks and time for a number of different speech variables
and metrics - information that is currently lacking in the literature. Overall,
70% of children's utterances during the problem-solving task in the lab were
directed to the self, and 93% of the children were observed to engage in at
least some private speech at T1, indicating that private speech is indeed
frequently observed during the preschool years. Individual quantitative
differences in children's private speech use in the laboratory were large yet
fairly stable across the two different problem-solving tasks used in this
study. That is, children who use a lot of one (or more) particular types of
self-talk during one task are likely to use similar amounts (relative to the
rest of the sample) of such verbal self-regulatory strategies on another task.
Although some tasks appear to be more likely to elicit particular types of
private speech, children tend to maintain their relative ranks in terms of the
frequency with which they use different types of private speech across tasks,
the extent to which the speech is syntactically abbreviated, and the proportion
of children's private speech which is partially internalized. It is important
to note, however, that overall proportion of children's speech that was
self-directed as opposed to other-directed (the ` coefficient of egocentricity '
as some have historically called it) did not show stability across task or time.
[1] Associations between the private speech measures and child task performance on the LG
and SA tasks in the lab were not explored here both because speech and concurrent task
performance associations were not among the goals of the study, and because getting
around the third-variable confound of task difficulty for such analyses requires special
microanalytical coding techniques (see Winsler et al., 1997) that were not a feature of the
study.

This particular early measure, originally used by Vygotsky and Piaget
and indeed rarely used by contemporary researchers because the focus has
appropriately shifted from how ` egocentric ' the child is to what functions
private speech serves for children, appears to be of limited usefulness.
Further, although there is ontogenetic change in children's private speech
between the ages of 3 ; 6 and 5 ; 6, a fair degree of stability over time (6 months)
is also present in terms of children maintaining quantitative and qualitative
individual differences on most private speech variables from T1 to T2. Less
stability over time was observed for children's partially internalized private
speech (whispers and inaudible muttering) than for other dimensions of
children's self-talk and this is related to significant developmental change
and interindividual differences in change in this type of speech over this
age period (as discussed below). The finding of stability and reliability of
individual differences in children's private speech across tasks and time is
important for future research exploring the developmental significance of
such speech and the role it may play in self-regulation. This is because it
confirms that, in addition, to microgenetic/microanalytical questions about
the functions of such speech and particular speech-performance relations
during individual problem-solving, interesting larger-scale ontogenetic
questions about change over time in children's private speech, and interindividual differences in such intraindividual change, can also be profitably
addressed.
This study contributed sorely needed longitudinal data that reveal
important developmental changes in children's private speech that occur
during the preschool period. The proportional topography of children's
private speech changes between the ages of 3;0 and 5;0. Three-year-old
private speech is more characterized by overt, task-relevant (Level II) forms,
whereas four-year-old self-talk consists of more partially internalized (Level
III - whispers/muttering) forms. Further, a number of changes in children's
speech during problem-solving appear to take place between the ages of 3 ;6
and 4; 0. These include a reduction in the total number of social speech
utterances, a decrease in the average number of words per private speech
utterance, and an increase in the proportion of private speech which is
partially internalized. Such developments in children's private speech during
the preschool years are consistent with our hypotheses and with Vygotskian
predictions about the gradual internalization and abbreviation of private
speech during early childhood. Although other investigators have found
similar developmental trends in private speech among older children (Bivens
& Berk, 1990), these findings suggest that ontogenetic changes in children's
self-talk are evident earlier, between ages 3; 0 and 5;0.
Clear associations were found in this study between children's private
speech use in the laboratory setting and their behaviour in the classroom and
at home. Children whose private speech during problem-solving in the lab
604

PRIVATE SPEECH

was more partially internalized had fewer externalizing behaviour problems
reported by the teacher, and better social skills reported by both parent and
teacher. Children whose private speech in the lab was largely task-irrelevant
engaged in less goal-directed behaviour in the classroom, expressed more
negative and less positive affect in the classroom, and had poorer social skills
and more externalizing behaviour problems as reported by the teacher. Such
findings are consistent with Vygotskian predictions of greater behavioural
self-regulation accompanying increasing internalization of speech, and are
quite notable since associations between children's private speech in one
setting and their behaviour in another setting have proved difficult to
document in previous studies with slightly older children (Berk & Landau,
1993). Thus, the present study provides evidence that individual differences
in children's private speech are associated with differences in children's
observed self-regulatory behaviour in the classroom. Future work will have
to determine whether private speech plays an important causal or mediating
role in the development of self-regulation or whether it is simply an artifact
correlated with other things, such as behavioural control or more general
verbal ability.
The present study has a number methodological limitations that should be
addressed in future research. One limitation is clearly the relatively small
sample size of the present study combined with a relatively large number of
variables/analyses. Replication of the current findings with a larger sample is
needed. The number and strength of the results found in the present study
even in the presence of a small sample attest to the robust size of the effects
under investigation and suggest that future study is warranted. A second
limitation of the present study is the relatively short-term longitudinal
window (6 months) explored and the fact that only two points in time were
assessed. Better information about intraindividual ontogenetic change in
private speech and interindividual differences in such change would be
obtained with a larger scale longitudinal study with three or more time
periods. Third, fairly global child behavioural variables (i.e. behaviour problems reported by adults) were used in the present work. Another potentially
fruitful avenue for future research in order to advance our understanding
of the role of private speech in children's self-regulation would be to
examine links between children's private speech use and their performance
on standardized laboratory batteries tapping particular aspects of
children's emerging behavioural control, such as inhibitory/effortful control,
internalization, or compliance (Kochanska, Murray & Harlan, 2000).
Research on the normative developmental patterns of children's selfregulation and private speech can inform efforts to predict and modify
maladaptive developmental pathways that may eventually lead to impulse
control and disruptive behaviour disorders. The present investigation
has contributed new data showing that individual differences in preschool
605

W I N S L E R E T A L.

children's private speech use are fairly stable across tasks and time,
developmental change occurs during the preschool years in children's use
and internalization of private speech, and children's private speech use in the
laboratory is related to their behaviour and social skills in the home and
preschool setting. Future research should explore the extent to which the
internalization of children's private speech contributes independently to, or
mediates developments within children's emerging self-regulation.
