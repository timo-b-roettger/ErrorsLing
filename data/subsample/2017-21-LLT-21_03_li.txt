Using corpora to develop learners'
collocational competence

Abstract
This article investigates the role of direct corpus use in learners' collocational competence in academic
writing. An experiment was conducted between two groups of Chinese postgraduates who had no previous
knowledge of corpora. It was embedded in a regular 4-month linguistics course in the students'
programmes, where a corpus-assisted method was used for the experimental group and a traditional, or
rule-based, method was used for the control group. The English essays written by these two groups of
learners from different time periods (before, immediately after, and two months after the course) were
analysed regarding the learners' collocational use--in particular, verb-preposition collocations. The
results reveal that while both groups showed improvements in their academic writing, the students in the
experimental group displayed a significant improvement in the use of collocations, including a higher rate
of accuracy, or naturalness, and an increased use of academic collocations and fixed phraseological items.
It is thus concluded that the knowledge and use of corpora can help students raise their awareness of
habitual collocational use and develop their collocational competence. This supports the positive role of
direct corpus application in an EFL context.

Introduction
There is an increasing consensus that a corpus, typically a large collection of naturally-occurring texts, is
of great value to language teaching. It provides both a rich source of attested language and an authentic
learning context for EFL learners who do not usually have as much exposure to the target language as native
speakers (McEnery & Hardie, 2012; O'Keeffe & McCarthy, 2010; Sinclair, 1991, 2004). As a result, a
significant number of corpus-based studies have been conducted to aid in the teaching of collocations. For
instance, many of them analyse collocations used by learners or by native speakers, providing useful
insights into classroom teaching (Fellbaum, 2007; Marco, 2011; Namvar, Nor, Ibrahim, & Mustafa, 2012;
Nesselhauf, 2003, 2005). A few focus on creating corpus-informed pedagogical materials such as corpusbased collocation dictionaries and academic collocation lists (Ackermann & Chen, 2013; Bahardoust, 2013;
Durrant, 2009; Huang, Chen, Tsao, & Wible, 2015; McGee, 2012).
While the above-mentioned areas attract an increasing amount of attention, direct corpus application in the
teaching of collocations in the EFL context, particularly on a long-term basis, is still rare. More than a
decade ago, Granger (2004) pointed out that "the number of concrete corpus-informed achievements [was]
not proportional to the number of publications advocating the use of corpora to inform pedagogical
practice" (p. 136); this may still be true today. The number of actual applications of corpora in classrooms
is in no way proportional to the number of corpus-based studies of collocation. As Leko-Szymaska and
Boulton (2015) noted recently, "the direct uses of corpora in language teaching are treated rather
marginally" (p. 3). The main reason for such scarce empirical use, for example in China, is that many
English teachers are not equipped with sufficient knowledge or techniques to be able to use corpora in

teaching. A great many teachers are still skeptical of the role of corpus-assisted teaching in contrast to
traditional methods.
Against such a background, the current research incorporates direct corpus use into a 4-month course in a
university setting in China and investigates its role in the development of learners' collocational
competence. More specifically, this research explores the following questions:
1. Is it feasible to incorporate direct corpus use into a regular curriculum? And if it is, is the long-term
effect positive?
2. Is the corpus-assisted method more effective than a traditional or rule-based method in the teaching
of collocations?
3. If so, what role does the corpus-assisted method play in learners' development of collocational
competence, particularly regarding the frequency of collocations, used and misused, and the use of
academic collocations and fixed phraseological items?
It is hoped that by addressing these questions, new insights can be provided into corpus applications in the
modern era of EFL teaching.

Corpus Application in the Teaching of Collocations
There is no lack of corpus-based studies informing the teaching of collocations, but many of them focus on
an indirect application of corpora in classroom settings, for example in designing corpus-informed materials
such as collocation dictionaries or lists to be used in classrooms (Ackermann & Chen, 2013; Durrant, 2009;
McGee, 2012). On the other hand, it is rare to observe direct uses of corpora in a course to develop learners'
collocational competence--probably because it presents teachers with several practical obstacles. For
instance, it may be argued that the attested data in a corpus are not simple enough for learners, especially
those with lower-level proficiency, or that a great amount of time is often spent simply in familiarising
students with corpus use (see Leko-Szymaska & Boulton, 2015).
Despite such difficulties, direct corpus application in classrooms offers multiple advantages, including
access to authentic language, learner autonomy in the practice of concordance analysis, and opportunities
for learners to explore how language really behaves and to raise their awareness of natural collocational
use. As Johns (1990) suggests, a central point of data-driven learning (DDL) is that we should "cut out the
middleman as far as possible and [...] give the learner direct access to the data" (p. 18).
Luckily, there are a number of research projects that have experimented with mediated or direct uses of
corpora in the teaching of collocations. For instance, Vyatkina (2016) showed that paper-based DDL
materials were more effective than traditional methods for teaching new collocations to students at lowerproficiency levels. This is one particularly revealing study that focused on the role of corpus use in learning
verb-preposition collocations, but this research mainly involved one-time DDL interventions. Wu, Witten,
and Franken (2010) evaluated a system that used a web-derived corpus with several student participants
and illustrated how it was useful for expanding their collocational knowledge in writing. Their study is
worth mentioning, because students had direct access to a pre-processed and filtered collection of
concordances in the revision process of collocational use in their writing. However, this study was primarily
a test of effectiveness of that system, which awaits application in classroom teaching. Similarly, while
Reynolds (2016) demonstrated that the adoption of a web-based collocational concordancer largely
increased learners' accuracy in collocational use, the study only partially incorporated direct corpus use in
a writing course, namely when students self-edited their essays for verb-noun errors. Other studies, such as
Celik (2011), Daskalovska (2015), and Huang (2014), also found that corpus application was beneficial in
the teaching of collocations, but they mostly involved short-term experiments where a corpus was not truly
embedded in a regular course. This gap justifies the current research to explore the feasibility of
incorporating direct corpus use into a regular curriculum to teach collocations, especially on a relatively
long-term basis.

Verb-Preposition Collocations
Rationales
This study investigates verb collocations because EFL learners, even advanced ones, tend to have frequent
problems with them. For instance, Kallkvist (1998) suggested that awkward collocations used by advanced
Swedish learners of English are often related to the use of verbs. Both Nesselhauf (2005) and Marco (2011)
asserted that verb collocation is the major source for questionable or deviant combinations in EFL learners'
language use. In addition, Wang and Shaw (2008) summarised the results from other studies on
collocational errors and concluded that EFL learners made the most errors in the collocational use of verbs,
followed by prepositions and determiners.
There are generally three types of collocations that involve the use of verbs: V + N, Adv + V, and V + Prep
(see Benson, Benson, & Ilsen, 1986, p. ix; Lewis, 2000; Wu et al., 2010). Many previous studies have been
dedicated to investigating verb-noun collocations (e.g., Ebrahimi-Bazzaz, Samad, bin Ismail, & Noordin,
2014; Marco, 2011; Nesselhauf, 2003, 2005; Zinkgraf, 2008), but little attention has been given to the use
of verb-preposition collocations (see Vyatkina, 2016; Wong, 2014). This gap also serves as one of the key
motivations for the present study.
Two other reasons highlight the importance of investigating verb-preposition collocations. First, this type
of collocation occurs relatively frequently in learners' writing. For example, Namvar et al. (2012) examined
nine types of collocations (e.g., V + N, Adj + N, N + N, V + Prep, and Adj + Prep) in learners' writing, and
found that the occurrence of verb-preposition collocations actually ranks second, immediately after verbnoun collocations. Second, it will be rather rewarding to focus on verb-preposition collocations in teaching.
The study conducted by Wu et al. (2010) supports this point. They utilised lexical data from a web-derived
corpus to expand learners' collocational knowledge, and showed that the learners can perform particularly
well (100% correct) on verb-preposition collocations after looking at a collection of natural collocational
use (pp. 97-99).
Identifying Verb-Preposition Collocations
Although the term verb-preposition collocation has emerged in a number of studies, an ideal or agreed
definition of it has yet to be provided. Since the current research does not attempt to propose a theoretically
rigorous definition, it follows three main criteria to identify verb-preposition collocations: frequency, span
of combinations, and pragmatic function.
First, one of the main preconditions for a verb-preposition combination to be viewed as a collocation in this
study is its frequent occurrence in language use. Combinations that are infrequent do not fully merit the
label collocation and are also less important in an EFL learning context (see Barnbrook, Mason, &
Krishnamurthy, 2013; Handl, 2008; Howarth, 1996). As a consequence, combinations that occur less than
three times per hundred million words in a general reference corpus, such as the British National Corpus
(BNC), were not considered in this study.1
Second, the current analysis focuses on the collocations where the preposition occurs within a span of three
words of the verb. In other words, both adjacent collocations (V + Prep) and discontinuous collocations (V
+ ? + Prep and V + ? + ? + Prep) are examined. Discontinuous collocations are considered so as to increase
the opportunity to identify verb-preposition collocations. For example, a few verb-preposition collocations
such as put emphasis on and pay attention to may have words inserted between the verb and the preposition.
However, combinations of a verb and a preposition that occur outside the span of three words are not
considered in this study, taking account of the feasibility of the analysis.
Third, the pragmatic function is used as a criterion to distinguish between verb-preposition collocations and
verb-particle or verb-adverb constructions. Although a few studies (e.g., Aarts, 1989; Farrell, 2005; Keizer,
2009) included verb-particle and verb-adverb combinations under the umbrella term verb-preposition
constructions for reasons such as efficiency, this research makes a distinction between these combinations

156

Language Learning & Technology

because it is believed that the usage of a verb-preposition combination and that of a verb-particle or verbadverb combination are essentially different, both semantically and pragmatically (Gries, 2003; Kim &
Baldwin, 2010; Treffers-Daller, 2011). To this end, this study refers to Jackendoff (2002, p. 69-70), who
proposed two primary rules to disambiguate these constructions. When the verb in the combination is
intransitive and the non-verbal element serves as the only complement (e.g., George grew up or Fred
freaked out), this combination is a verb-particle construction. Conversely, if the non-verbal element is not
the only complement (e.g., Bill ran up the street or companies need to communicate with customers), this
combination is a verb-preposition construction. When the verb in the combination is transitive and the nonverbal element can appear on either side of the object (e.g., Pat put out the garbage or Pat put the garbage
out), this combination is a verb-particle construction. In contrast, if the non-verbal element can only appear
on the left side of the object or complement (e.g., language teaching will benefit from a DDL approach),
the combination is a verb-preposition construction.

Methodology
Overview of Research Procedure
In this research, an experiment was conducted to investigate the role of direct corpus use in the development
of learners' collocational competence in English academic writing. Both the experimental and control
groups completed a course in linguistics, with the former using a corpus-assisted approach and the latter a
more traditional approach. English essays written by these two groups of learners from different time
periods (before, immediately after, and two months after the course) were collected and analysed in terms
of the use of verb-preposition collocations. In the following sections, detailed information about the
participants, the courses they took, the data used for the current analysis, and the procedure for retrieving
verb-preposition collocations is discussed.
Participants and Courses
The participants in this experiment were 60 Chinese postgraduate students who had no previous knowledge
of corpora. They were all majoring in English at three top universities in Chengdu. They were either in the
first or second year of postgraduate study, and their ages ranged from 21 to 26. Before the experiment, they
were assessed by writing an English essay of around 2,000 words on any topic related to linguistics (for the
assessment criteria, see Appendix A). Based on their writing performance, 30 students were assigned to the
experimental group and the other 30 to the control group. This initial assessment was to ensure that the
average performance of the two groups in writing was similar.
Next, the two groups completed a 15-week course on linguistics using, respectively, a corpus-assisted
method and a traditional method (i.e., no introduction or use of a corpus, usually with a rule-based and
teacher-fronted style). The main reason for choosing linguistics is that this course is often essential for
English major postgraduate programmes in China. Very few universities in China provide general English
language courses to English major postgraduate students, so it is usually the case that the linguistics course
will aim to develop students' ability in language analysis as well as their English language proficiency. The
course introduced several important language phenomena, including words, words and meaning, words and
grammar, phraseology, collocation, discourse, and genre analysis. Were the experiment based on this course
successful, the result would indicate that it is feasible to integrate direct corpus use into a regular curriculum
so as to develop learners' collocational competence or English language competence in general.
More specifically, the experimental group was taught the course using mainly the academic part of the
BNC, along with Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA).2 Each session incorporated direct
corpus use. The teacher adopted an inductive approach and helped the students first to understand new
language phenomena (e.g., collocation and phraseology) and explore their usage (for an example worksheet,
see Appendix B). The control group, on the other hand, was taught this course using a traditional or rulebased method with the same teacher. These students had access to dictionaries and carried out similar
activities with a more teacher-centred approach and no corpus use. Appendix C provides more details of

the course contents and activities for the two groups.
For this experiment, written informed consent was obtained from all the participants who kindly allowed
their essays to be used for research purposes. They were informed that these essays would be a means to
monitor their progress in English academic writing, but they did not know that their collocational
competence would be the main focus of this research. Withholding this piece of information prevented
students from paying extra attention to collocational use while writing their essays.
Data for the Current Analysis
As mentioned above, each participant wrote three essays in different time periods (before, at the end of,
and two months after the course). For each essay, the students were instructed to write on any topic related
to linguistics for around 2,000 words and were given one week to write the essay after class. 3 They were
also allowed access to any tools or materials they used in the course (e.g., the experimental group was
allowed to use the corpora while the control group had access to dictionaries and their learning materials).
The essays written by two students in the control group were not considered for further analysis, because
they did not participate in all sessions of their course, which to some extent invalidated the analysis of their
essays. Therefore, the current analysis focused on 174 essays in total (90 by the experimental group and 84
by the control group).
These 174 essays were later processed to anonymize participants' personal information and then tagged in
terms of part of speech (POS), constituting the corpus for the current investigation. 4 This corpus is referred
to as the Corpus of Student Essays (CSE), consisting of 375,672 tokens. The CSE was further divided into
six subcorpora to distinguish texts from different groups and time periods (see Figure 1). The six subcorpora
were analysed using WordSmith Tools 6 (Scott, 2015).

Retrieving Verb-preposition Collocations
Based on the criteria discussed earlier for identifying verb-preposition collocations, two steps were
followed to retrieve the target items. First, all the instances in the POS-tagged corpus that contained the
combinations of a verb and a preposition within a span of three words were obtained. Second, these
retrieved instances were examined carefully to separate those that did not contain verb-preposition
collocations. Two native speakers of English were also involved in this identification process. Based on a
random sample of 1,000 concordance lines from the retrieved instances, an inter-coder reliability analysis
was performed using the Kappa statistic to determine consistency, and a substantial agreement was found
among the two coders: Kappa = 0.76, p < .001, 95% CI [0.72, 0.80].
To summarise, six cases were not considered in this study, as shown in Table 1. The first case concerned
the most important criterion for identifying verb-preposition collocation: frequency. Combinations that

158

Language Learning & Technology

occurred less than three times in the BNC were not considered in the subsequent analysis. The second and
third cases related to the mis-tagging of data--for example, a mis-tagged verb or preposition in a
combination. The fourth case involved combinations of the verb to be and a preposition (e.g., is about and
are in). They were disregarded because they were not very revealing with regard to learners' collocational
use. In the fifth case, the preposition in the combination was actually part of another fixed phrase (e.g.,
violate on purpose and arranged at the same time). Finally, verb-particle and verb-adverb combinations
were distinguished from verb-preposition collocations by considering the two criteria provided by
Jackendoff (2002) and the feedback from the two coders.

Results
General Overview of Participants' Collocational Use
A general overview of each learner's collocational use can be observed from three aspects: the total number
of tokens of verb-preposition collocations, the variety of collocations used, and the frequency of misused
collocations. Table 2 presents an overview concerning the experimental and control groups in different time
periods. These three aspects of collocational use were examined in terms of the mean value, that is, the
average tokens, the types of collocations, and the misuse of collocations associated with each group (also
illustrated in Figure 2).

Figure 2. An overview of learners' collocational use over time
It can be inferred from Table 2 that before the course (Time 1), the average number of tokens, types, and
misuse of verb-preposition collocations associated with the two groups were similar. Levene's test of
equality of variances also indicated that the variance between the two groups in Time 1 was not statistically
different, whether for tokens (F(1, 56) = 0.01, p = .949), types (F(1, 56) = 0.23, p = .633), or misuse (F(1, 56) =
0.03, p = .862).
Regarding the average frequencies of misused collocations, it is worth pointing out that although the mean
values of misuse associated with the two groups seemed small, the error rate was actually not low. The
experimental group had an average error rate of 30.0% (12.40/41.27), and the control group had a rate of
28.1% (11.86/42.14). Therefore, the misuse of verb-preposition collocations needed to be given adequate
attention.
After taking the course, it seemed that both groups exhibited a similar trend in the development of
collocational use, using more tokens and types of verb-preposition collocations and producing fewer
misused collocations over time. The repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that the increased use of tokens
and types of collocations were statistically significant for both groups (tokens, F(1, 56) = 2115.91, p < .001,
2 = .98; types, F(1, 56) = 420.72, p < .001, 2 = .94) and that the decrease in misuse was also significant for
all participants (F(1, 56) = 123.47, p < .001, 2 = .82).
However, it was also noticeable that for these three aspects of collocational use, any increase or decrease
associated with the experimental group was more striking than that of the control group (Figure 2). First,
there was a much more dramatic increase in the average number of verb-preposition collocations used by
the experimental group than by the control group. The ANOVA performed on the tokens of collocations
indicated a statistically significant difference between the two groups (F(1, 56) = 757.12, p < .001, 2 = .93),
both from Time 1 to Time 2 (p < .001) and from Time 1 to Time 3 (p < .001), though there was no significant
difference from Time 2 to Time 3. Second, while both groups tended to use more types of verb-preposition
collocations after the course, the increase of average collocation types associated with the experimental
group was far more than that of the control group. This difference between groups was statistically
significant (F(1, 56) = 270.08, p < .001, 2 = .83), but pairwise comparisons only indicated significant
differences between Time 1 and Time 2 (p < .001) and between Time 1 and Time 3 (p < .001); not between
Time 2 and 3 (p = .337). Third, there was a much more dramatic decrease in the frequency of misused

160

Language Learning & Technology

collocations by the experimental group than by the control group (Figure 2), with a significant effect
(F(1, 56) = 138.34, p < .001, 2 = .71). Follow-up comparisons again revealed that pairwise differences were
significant between Time 1 and Time 2 (p < .001) and between Time 1 and Time 3 (p < .001); not between
Time 2 and Time 3.
This overview of results indicates that both groups benefitted from the course in terms of improvement in
their collocational use. The experimental group, in particular, showed a significant improvement in terms
of the variety and accuracy of collocational use. The following sections will discuss in detail how the
knowledge and use of corpora affect learners' collocational competence.
Participants' Misuse of Collocations
Main Types of Misuse
How, or when, learners misuse collocations is often considered an intriguing question by English teachers
and researchers who aim to develop learners' collocational competence. Based on the essays written by the
participants before the course, it was found that their misuse of collocations could be generally categorised
into four types, as illustrated in Table 3. The inter-coder reliability test for tagging the misuse showed that
there was a very high level of agreement among the two coders: Kappa = 0.87, p < .001, 95% CI [0.84,
0.91].

Note. * indicates the location of misuse.

The first type of misuse involved misspellings of the verb in a collocation. These misspellings often resulted
from students' confusions about the form of a few verbs (e.g., *devide for divide, *preceed for precede,
*seperate for separate, or *indentify for identify). Surprisingly, many of these errors were made by more
than one student in their writing. In other words, this type of misuse was not rare in participants' essays,
despite the fact that it could have been the easiest type to avoid in writing.
The second type of misuse related to the transitivity of verbs. Although it was not frequent in the current
study, Moehkardi (2002) asserts that the problems of verb transitivity in the use of verb collocations can be
overwhelming. In the examples in Table 3, verbs like penetrate and concern do not need a preposition to
take an object. Another case related to this misuse arose when a verb could be either transitive or
intransitive, depending on the context. Take the collocation enter into and the verb enter for instance. Nouns
such as agreement and contract often follow enter into, exhibiting senses like commencement,
participation, or consideration. In contrast, nouns such as room and house often follow the verb enter,
reflecting its more physical association. Some participants were not fully aware of these usages and
constructed inappropriate expressions such as *enter into the building and *enter into the school.
The third type of misuse concerned a misuse of the preposition in a collocation, and was the most frequent
type of misuse associated with the participants in this study before the course (62.5% among all types of

Shuangling Li

misuse). For example, the following is a list of such misused verb-preposition collocations, which occurred
relatively frequently in the participants' essays:
adapt to (adapt *for); be confined to (be confined *in); be engaged in (be engaged *with); be related
to (be related *with); comply with (comply *in); concentrate on (concentrate *with); dedicate to
(dedicate *on); derive from (derive *with); differ from (differ *with); distinguish between x and y
(distinguish *from x and y); immigrate to (immigrate *in); suffer from (suffer *with)
It was found that the top three misused collocations of this type contained the prepositions to, with, and
from (an error rate of 21.7%, 17.3%, and 15.5%, respectively). This result could be partially explained by
the high frequency of the prepositions to and with themselves, or it could be an indication that these
collocations were relatively more difficult for the participants to acquire than others (see Jalali & Shojaei,
2012, p. 89-90). Either way, it can be argued that explicit teaching of these frequently misused collocations
in classrooms is worthwhile in order to reduce learners' use of awkward collocations. On the other hand,
the collocations that contained the preposition by were less frequently misused among all the combinations
(an error rate of 1.9%). It is possible that the preposition by was easier for these learners to use than other
prepositions since it mainly reflected a sense of agency or passive voice. This speculation was also
supported by the study conducted by Zhou, Rong, and Huang (2014, p. 1439-1440) which showed that the
preposition by had a higher precision rate than many other prepositions in Chinese learners' writing.
The fourth type of misuse concerned the remaining awkward collocations used in participants' essays, often
a result of misunderstanding the entire collocation. For instance, in the first example in Table 3, the student
used the combination distinguished as to express a meaning that can be more appropriately realised by fixed
collocations such as recognised as or considered as. Similarly, in the second example, the combination
follow with could have been substituted with fit, exhibit, or show, which would have been more suitable in
that context.
Misuse of Collocations over Time
This section examines the occurrences of the aforementioned four types of misused collocations in students'
essays over time so as to indicate the development of their collocational competence in terms of accuracy.
Table 4 presents such an overview, showing the average frequencies for each type of misuse found in the
different time periods.

Note. The numbers in the Mean column (M) indicate the average frequencies for one certain misuse associated with
the experimental (or the control) group in a certain time period. For example, the number in the top left of this table
(2.17) indicates the average frequency of misuse in spelling associated with the experimental group at Time 1.

Concerning the first two types of misuse, Table 4 shows that after the course, both groups reduced the

162

Language Learning & Technology

number of misused collocations in their essays (spelling, F(1, 56) = 10.43, p < .001, 2 = .28; transitivity,
F(1, 56) = 18.06, p < .001, 2 = .40). However, there was no statistically significant difference between groups
(spelling, F(1, 56) = 2.57, p = .114, 2 = .04; transitivity, F(1, 56) = 0.18, p = .674, 2 = .00). This finding thus
highlights the importance of explicit instructions of any kind in the development of learners' collocational
competence, especially with regard to spelling and transitivity.
It was evident that after the course, the final two types of misuse appeared much less frequently in the
essays written by the participants in the experimental group, with a significant effect (preposition, F(1, 29) =
128.11, p < .001, 2 = .90; awkward, F(1, 29) = 4.07, p = .028, 2 = .23). In contrast, these two types of misuse
still occurred frequently in the essays by the control group (no significant effect for the decrease of
preposition, F(1, 27) = 2.00, p = .156, 2 = .13; no significant effect for the decrease of awkward F(1, 27) = 0.21,
p = .813, 2 = .02). This contrast between groups was also statistically significant: significant from Time 1
to Time 2 and from Time 1 to Time 3 for preposition (F(1, 56) = 97.99, p < .001, 2 = .64) and similarly
significant from Time 1 to Time 2 and from Time 1 to Time 3 for awkward (F(1, 56) = 8.20, p = .006, 2
= .13). This suggests that the corpus-assisted learning method may have been more useful than the
traditional method in terms of helping students reduce their misuse of collocations, particularly those related
to the use of prepositions.
Collocations Frequently Used by the Participants
Apart from the above-mentioned misused collocations, participants used many other collocations
reasonably well in their essays. Table 5 lists the 15 most frequently used verb-preposition collocations, both
before and after the course.

First, among these frequent collocations, some were used much less frequently after the course, while a few
new collocations were used--often, they were academic collocations (i.e., combinations that occurred
significantly more frequently in academic discourse; see the definition of academic collocations in
Ackermann & Chen, 2013; Durrant, 2009). For example, before the course, both groups used many general
collocations, such as borrow from, know about, and learn from, which occur relatively less frequently in
academic writing. After completing the course, it seems that these general collocations were used less
frequently. On the other hand, both groups made use of more academic collocations: defined as, proposed
by, and suggested by in the essays from the experimental group; proved by and written by in the essays from
the control group. This trend was particularly evident concerning the experimental group (see Table 6). It
was clear that in both Time 2 and Time 3, the essays from the experimental group contained more academic
collocations than those from the control group. This difference between groups was also statistically
significant (F(1, 56) = 579.51, p < .001, 2 = .91; significant both from Time 1 to Time 2 and from Time 1 to
Time 3).

Note. The identification of academic collocations refers to the lists provided by previous researchers (e.g., Ackermann
& Chen, 2013; Durrant, 2009; Huang et al., 2015).

Second, it was also noticed from Table 5 that some verb-preposition collocations used in participants'
essays formed a part of longer phrases (e.g., paid to could be considered as a part of attention was paid to;
put on as a part of put emphasis on). Interestingly, it seemed that such collocations were used relatively
frequently by the experimental group after the course, and warranted examination over time. Table 7 shows
the average tokens and frequent examples of such collocations used by the two groups in different time
periods. It was found that both groups used more such collocations after the course, which suggests that the
knowledge learned from the course may have facilitated use of phraseological expressions, among the
experimental group in particular. This group difference was also statistically significant (F(1, 56) = 335.97, p
< .001, 2 = .86; significant both from Time 1 to Time 2 and from Time 1 to Time 3).

Note. The discussion of phraseological expressions takes into account three main criteria: frequency, syntagmatic
fixedness, and semantic non-compositionality (see Barnbrook et al., 2013; Handl, 2008; Howarth, 1996; Sinclair,
1991).

Discussion
The experiment showed that while both the experimental and control groups benefitted from the course
over time, the participants in the experimental group greatly improved in terms of their collocational
competence. More specifically, the knowledge and use of corpora seemed to contribute to three aspects of
learners' collocational competence: decreased use of awkward collocations, increased use of academic
collocations, and a higher degree of phraseological features exhibited in their writing.

164

Language Learning & Technology

Awkward Collocations
Awkward collocations are often considered as markers of non-native use in writing because EFL learners,
regardless of their language levels, frequently produce sentences with awkward collocations (Marco, 2011;
Nesselhauf, 2003, 2005). Various reasons may be given for this, including influence from learners' L1 and
cultural background (Farghal & Obiedat, 1995; Namvar et al., 2012), insufficient knowledge about the
usage of these collocations (Koosha & Jafarpour, 2006; Namvar & Ibrahim, 2014), and learners' personal
experience and language competence (Ebrahimi-Bazzaz et al., 2014; Ganji, 2012). Fortunately, many of
these aspects can be effectively addressed with autonomous implicit learning--or in particular, explicit
teaching. A number of studies (e.g., Kennedy, 2003; Sonbul & Schmitt, 2013; Zaferanieh & Behrooznia,
2011) suggest that learners who receive explicit instruction on collocations perform better than those who
receive no instructions or implicit instruction through mere exposure.
The findings from the current research also support the prominent role of explicit instruction in the teaching
of collocations. The participants in both groups experienced an improvement in their collocational use after
explicit instruction. The improvement associated with the control group suggests that any sort of explicit
teaching may be useful to develop learners' collocational competence.
More importantly, the current analysis revealed that the incorporation of the corpus-assisted approach into
teaching was much more useful than the traditional or rule-based explicit instructions. After taking the
corpus-assisted course, it was evident that the participants in the experimental group used fewer awkward
collocations than those in the control group. This result affirms the positive role of a corpus in teaching.
The corpus, as a collection of authentic language texts, provides a rich source of natural language for EFL
learners and raises learners' awareness of the naturalness of collocational use in writing (Flowerdew, 2012;
Sinclair, 1991). Further, it enables the participants to develop a learning habit to check their use of
collocations or other phraseological expressions with attested language data (Flowerdew, 2015; Reppen,
2010).
Academic Collocations
The second finding was that corpus use contributed to an increase in learners' use of academic collocations,
a finding that has not been frequently addressed in previous research. A large number of studies have aimed
to provide a corpus-based analysis of academic collocations in specific disciplines or across disciplines,
showing the relationship between collocations and genre (Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; Marco, 2000;
Ordem & Bada, 2016; Ward, 2007); others have sought to create lists of academic collocations for
classroom use (Ackermann & Chen, 2013; Durrant, 2009; Huang et al., 2015). More studies are still needed
to highlight the connection between corpus use and learners' choice of academic collocations.
The current analysis contributes to the existing literature in showing that the experimental group used
academic collocations more frequently than the control group after the course (see Table 6). It is inferred
that corpus use has given the participants constant exposure to academic discourse and opportunities to
notice, either intentionally or subconsciously, features of such discourse. In other words, direct access to a
corpus of academic texts may enable learners to notice the style of the given discourse and foster an
awareness of using academic collocations in their writing. Therefore, this finding implies that the teaching
of academic collocations could be carried out with a combination of methods. In addition to methods
suggested by previous studies, such as making use of corpus-informed academic collocation lists and
collocation dictionaries in classrooms, it is also beneficial to give learners direct access to a corpus so that
they can observe and investigate collocational use themselves.
Phraseological Features
The results from the current study also suggest that the corpus-assisted learning course had a positive
influence on the use of more fixed phraseologies. It was found that after the course, the essays written by
the experimental group contained far more collocations that were a part of fixed phraseologies than those
written by the control group. This indicates how direct corpus use may change the extent to which learners

Shuangling Li

165

use phraseological items or the extent to which their writing is phraseological. This change echoes the
argument from previous studies that the integration of corpora into teaching can help learners detect lexicogrammatical patterning in given texts (McEnery & Hardie, 2012; O'Keeffe & McCarthy, 2010; Sinclair,
1991). Opportunities to analyse words through concordance tools may help learners to realise how language
itself tends to be phraseological, and how words do not just respond to the open choice principle, but more
importantly, the idiom principle (see Sinclair, 1991, 2004). Inductive learning with corpora is, perhaps,
more important and effective in the long term than having teachers simply highlight the phraseological
features of language use.

Conclusion
This research empirically applied direct corpus use in classroom settings in China on a relatively long-term
basis and explored its role in learners' development of collocational competence in academic writing. An
experiment was conducted between two groups of Chinese postgraduate students, using a corpus-assisted
approach for the experimental group and a traditional one for the control group. The analysis focused on
the essays written by these participants in three different time periods: before, immediately after, and two
months after the course. This experiment first suggests that it is feasible and positive to incorporate direct
corpus use into a regular course, such as linguistics. The results further show that the experimental group
experienced a significantly greater improvement in collocational use than the control group. The
improvement is reflected in many aspects, such as the increase in the total number of collocations used in
their writing, the increased variety of collocations, the increased accuracy in collocational use, and the
increased use of academic collocations.
These findings support the view that corpus-assisted learning can greatly contribute to the development of
learners' collocational competence. Traditional explicit instruction on collocational use may be useful to
learners to some extent, but corpus-assisted instruction is particularly effective in improving learners' use
of collocations. What a corpus offers learners is an authentic learning context and the opportunity to
investigate language use themselves. This exposure to attested language data raises learners' awareness of
using collocations in a more natural or near-native way. Additionally, the method of inductive learning
facilitates noticing of habitual collocations, which reduces learners' tendency to form awkward
collocations. Given all these advantages, it would be beneficial for more researchers and teachers to
investigate direct corpus applications in classroom settings. Since this study mainly focuses on verbpreposition collocations to investigate the role of corpus use, it would be useful for future research to
explore other types of commonly-used collocations by learners or other aspects of learners' collocational
competence, providing a more comprehensive picture of how the corpus-assisted approach will greatly
facilitate language learning in the modern era.

Appendix B. An Example Worksheet Used by the Experimental Group
Introducing collocation in the BNCweb:
1. What is collocation?
Group activity: Search online, find out its definitions and examples, and present in class
Hint: Collocation as a concept versus collocation as a methodology
2. The collocation function of the BNCweb: The case of tea
a. Analyse the first page of concordances of tea in the BNCweb.
What are its collocates and why? What criteria do you use?
b. Use the collocation function.
What features have you noticed from the collocation list? (Hint: grammatical words)
Change the span from the default (-3 to +3) to (-1 to -1). What is different in the collocation
list?
Now give restrictions to collocates: any adjective. What are the most frequent words in the
list?
3. Practice with the collocation function: The case of happen
Group activity: Find out about its collocates and features of these collocates

Note. Concerning the activities in each session, both groups focused on identical subjects--for example the same
words, phrases, collocations, and texts. Three verb-preposition collocations were explicitly shown or taught to the
participants: pay for, stop from, and learn from. The first two collocations were used as examples when introducing
verb-preposition collocation and the third one was used in class activities.
