VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE LINKS: DOES THE HIGHLIGHTING OF
HYPERLINKS AFFECT INCIDENTAL VOCABULARY LEARNING,
TEXT COMPREHENSION, AND THE READING PROCESS?
Isabelle De Ridder
University of Antwerp
ABSTRACT
This article investigates how the signaling-mode of electronic glosses in online texts (i.e.,
presented digitally on a computer screen) influences the user's reading process, incidental
vocabulary learning, and text comprehension. Indeed, does the fact that hyperlinks with
dictionary definitions are visible (i.e., highlighted) or invisible affect the foreign language
learner's look-up behaviour and as a consequence the possible learning outcome?
Furthermore, the article addresses the question whether the type of reading task (general
vs. specific) affects the learner's use of these links and the amount and quality of the
language learned. The article discusses empirical research conducted in an attempt to
address these questions. The results indicate that when reading a text with highlighted
hyperlinks, readers are significantly more willing to consult the gloss. However, this
increased clicking does not slow down the reading process, does not affect text
comprehension, and does not increase the vocabulary learned incidentally. The reading
task does not seem to alter the clicking behaviour of the students but seems to influence
the reader's vocabulary learning: A content-oriented reading task decreases the reader's
attention for vocabulary.

INTRODUCTION
Current technologies in language learning allow student-users to consult translations, dictionary
definitions, grammatical explanations, and cultural information at the simple click of a mouse. The
availability of this kind of additional, often multimediatic, information is considered to be one of the preeminent advantages of language learning via computers, and consulting any of these extras is no longer
seen as a major interruption of the language-learning activity. Research has concentrated on the
effectiveness of this supplementary information and has evaluated whether these annotations improve, for
instance, text comprehension or actual language learning (e.g., vocabulary learning). In general, they were
found to be beneficial to several aspects of language learning (e.g., Brett, 1997, 1998; Chun & Plass,
1996, 1997; Hulstijn, Hollander, & Greidanus, 1996; Lomicka, 1998). However, although many things
have been said about what should appear on the screen to obtain better results in language learning, how
these features should appear to the learner-user is still under investigation. The how question is often
considered to be a simple design question, independent of the learning process. But is this truly the case?
Is the layout of the screen an autonomous issue, separate from the learning that is going on? In reading
research, it has been suggested that the presentation-mode of a text on paper matters, and affects the
cognitive aspects of text processing: variables such as comprehension and reading speed are said to be
influenced by typefaces, margins, line length, font size (Frenckner, 1990, cited in Muter, 1996). It is still
unknown to what extent findings from paper media can be extended to electronic media (Muter, 1996),
but it has become clear through empirical research (see Dillon, 1992, for a review) that features such as
the use of colour, screen size, interline spacing, and size of characters can play a role in the optimisation
of reading from the screen and thus the learning that accompanies this reading.

Within the entire spectrum of all possible on-screen features that could have an impact on the amount and
the quality of language learning, I chose to focus on the signaling-mode of glosses. Indeed, the primary
aim of this study is to evaluate whether the way in which the software indicates that glosses are available
influences the learners' willingness to consult the gloss. Moreover, this research concentrates on how this
affects the readers' language learning (e.g., vocabulary learning) and overall text comprehension. In
software designed to improve foreign or second-language readings skills, one might opt for highlighting
difficult words, thus indicating a link with the provided extra information. When activating the hyperlink,
these additional annotations can then appear in a pop-up window or in a separate window at the bottom or
the top of the screen. More concretely, this highlighting -- which in itself is nothing but a visualisation of
the hyperlink -- could be the use of boldface type or a font colour different from the text colour, for
instance, with additional underlining of the word. Another option would be not to use highlights but to
insert invisible links; a choice that would result in a text in entirely the same type and font colour. To
summarise, a differentiation is made between the actual gloss (which is a content-related issue, i.e., the
translation and/or the dictionary definition that appears when the hyperlink is activated) and the hyperlink
(which is a technical feature that enables the gloss to appear). Hyperlinks can be visible or invisible: the
highlights are the means by which the hyperlink is visualised (in itself a graphical issue). See Appendix A
for an example of the two discussed interfaces.
I would like to stress that the effectiveness of the (electronic) gloss itself is not at issue here, since, as
mentioned above, the influence of marginal glosses on vocabulary learning and text comprehension has
been studied intensively. What is questioned here is whether the highlights -- used as a signalling-mode, a
graphical indication of a hyperlink leading to additional information -- have an impact on the reading
and/or language learning process. However, it is also taken into consideration that the possible effects of
visible (i.e., highlighted) or invisible links might be affected by the reading task (general vs. specific)
involved. The study hereby presented addresses these issues by discussing empirical data collected from
an experiment conducted at the University of Antwerp (Belgium).
RESEARCH AIMS AND RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY
Reading in a second language is considered to be a meaningful language-learning activity, be it on paper
or on screen. Indeed, while attempting overall text comprehension, learners interact with different types
of cultural, semantic, and syntactic information that can be processed and possibly learned/remembered.
Moreover, many second-language specialists see reading as a pre-eminent means of acquiring new
vocabulary (e.g., Krashen, 1989). This kind of vocabulary learning, where the vocabulary is "picked-up"
during normal L1 or L2 reading activities, is referred to in the research as "incidental" vocabulary
learning (e.g., Hulstijn et al., 1996; Nagy, Herman, & Anderson, 1985; Nation, 1990; Sternberg, 1987). It
is called "incidental" because the major purpose for the interaction with the particular environment or
material is not to learn words, but to understand the message of the text and to build up a coherent text
base. While reading, learners seem to "guess" (Huckin & Coady, 1999), "reconstruct" or "derive"
(Sternberg, 1987; Sternberg & Powell, 1983) the meaning of unknown words from the context. Whenever
the context fails to deliver the correct meaning of unknown words (when the context contains too many
unknown words or whenever the reader lacks the adequate cultural, world or domain knowledge [Drum &
Konopak, 1987]) the use of a dictionary or of marginal (electronic) glosses is one of the factors that can
promote pick-up rates (Ellis, Tanaka, & Yamazaki, 1994; Hulstijn, 1992; Knight, 1994).1 It is therefore of
great importance that students make the utmost use of the dictionary definitions the software provides.
However, a study by Black, Wright, Black, & Norman (1992) indicated that readers use electronic
definitions only for short-term purposes and that long-term retention is almost non-existent. Moreover, it
has also been suggested that inferred meanings are remembered better than given meanings (Hulstijn,
1992) and that inferring word meanings from context is still one of the most effective strategies for
learning new words. Advocates of this kind of vocabulary learning rely on the theory of "cognitive depth"

and high mental effort: the more actively we work out a solution to the problem, the more likely we are to
store this information permanently (Craik & Lockhart, 1972). Hulstijn et al. (1996) therefore suggest that
dictionary use should remain "well-determined."
Summarising, the software programme should provide the learner with dictionary definitions in order to
support the reader when the reading becomes problematic, but should also prevent the reader from
excessive clicking (called "click happy behavior" by Roby, 1999, p. 98) which could lead to a more
superficial, short-term learning. Therefore, the signalling-device of glosses plays an important part.
Indeed, on the one hand, a condition in which the hyperlinks are highlighted could incite the users to click
excessively, which could lead to a more temporary vocabulary acquisition. On the other hand, a condition
where the hyperlinks are invisible could encourage the students to make a more careful use of the glosses
and rely more on the context to figure out the meaning of unknown words (which in turn, could le ad to
more thorough retention of the vocabulary).
Nevertheless, in another line of thinking, it is also possible that the highlights indicating the hyperlinks
simply attract attention to the words in question, which could have a positive effect on vocabula ry
acquisition. Several studies seem to indicate that when a word is made salient, this has a positive
influence on its acquisition. In a study on listening comprehension, Brett (1998) for instance posits that if
language items are made salient in any way (e.g., by exercises), they are remembered better than others.
Brett did not focus on reading and vocabulary learning and therefore did not address the question of
comprehension of the whole text. In reading research, some studies also indicate that when words are
made salient, they are remembered better (Chun & Plass, 1996, 1997; Liu & Reed, 1995). Does this imply
that in a condition without highlights (a graphical tool to make words salient), vocabulary learning would
immediately become more difficult? And what would this mean in the long-term?
Some research has looked into the effects of how the users' willingness to consult an online dictionary
definition can be increased. A study by Black et al. (1992; similar but separate from the one mentioned
above), involving 20 subjects, suggested that if the glosses are indicated by a small black spot, displayed
as a superscript immediately after the glossed word, it increases the students' willingness to consult this
gloss. However, this study did not look into which effects these increased consultations might have on the
reading process, actual vocabulary learning, and text comprehension.
As far as the reading task is concerned, research has established that the way in which a text is read is
strongly influenced by the readers' study goals (e.g., text summarisation versus knowledge acquisition,
Schmalhofer & Glavanov, 1986). It is therefore not unlikely that a given reading task might influence the
students' use of either visible or invisible links, which might be reflected in the learning and/or reading
outcomes. Yet another small-scale study by Black et al. (1992) could not establish that the involvement of
a particular reading task (reading for gist or for detailed knowledge acquisition) differentiates the readers'
clicking behaviour. The five studies by Black et al. (1992) reported on in the single article relate to firstlanguage technical-vocabulary acquisition.
The present study aims to clarify the following issues: When difficult words are highlighted in a software
reading programme, does this incite the readers to click intensively, and, if so, does this have a positive
effect on the vocabulary acquisition? Or does this lead to excessive clicking, which only results in shortterm vocabulary retention? Or does the simple fact that the highlights make some words in the text salient
increase their chances of being better candidates for storage in long-term memory? Other studies have
looked into the signaling-mode of glosses and have addressed the question of salience, but these studies
did not concentrate on the combined effects of marking a hyperlink (i.e., highlighting) and the reading
task (general vs. specific) on vocabulary acquisition (short-term and long-term retention), text
comprehension, and reading process (reading time, clicking behaviour). Indeed, does increased clicking
slow down the reading? Or does reading and rereading a higher number of glosses take up as much time
as the combined action of consulting glosses and deriving a word meaning from its context? Moreover, is

it the case that when students consult more dictionary definitions, this also leads to a better understanding
of the remainder of the text? Research does tend to suggest that a strong correlation exists between
vocabulary and comprehension (Freebody & Anderson, 1983a, 1983b). However, perhaps it is the case
that the constant interruption of the reading process results in the construction of a less coherent text base.
A small-scale, introductory study on the subject (De Ridder, 1999; De Ridder, 2000; De Ridder & Van
Waes, 2000), including 17 second-year university economics students, revealed that these particular
foreign language readers clicked significantly more in a condition where the text contained highlighted
hyperlinks, and were thus more inclined to look for extra information (here dictionary definitions and
translations) than in a condition with invisible links. This clicking behaviour did not slow down the
reading process, nor did it affect text comprehension. It did have a significantly positive effect on the
amount of vocabulary incidentally learned from the text. Nevertheless, this positive effect seemed to have
disappeared in a delayed vocabulary test. One of the major advantages of this first study was that it made
it possible to test the experimental design and the quality of the instrumentation (more appropriate and
more in-depth testing was imperative). It also led to promising results worthy of more ample
investigations.
HYPOTHESES
Expected Effect of Marking and Reading Task on Clicking Behaviour
Marking Increases Clicking The experimental research of Black et al. (1992) indicates that if words in an
online text (i.e., presented digitally on a computer screen) are marked with a black spot behind the word,
they attract the readers' attention. If the willingness to consult a gloss increases by using a small black
spot, it can be hypothesised that the blue font colour and underlining would have the same effect on the
subjects involved in the present study. Moreover, the previous, introductory study suggested that readers
do click significantly more in the marked (or highlighted) condition than in the unmarked one.
A Specific Reading Task Decreases Clicking Research by Schmalhofer & Glavanov (1986) indicated
that a text is read differently according to the reading task. I therefore hypothesised that the reading task
would also change the clicking behaviour of the students. However, other research, by Black et al. (1992)
for instance, suggested that a different reading task does not imply a difference in the consultation of
dictionary definitions. The specific reading task used in the present study, however, was limited to strict
time-constraints. It was postulated that the orientation towards the comprehension of the text, together
with a slight time pressure, would incite the students to click only when absolutely necessary (i.e., when
the unknown vocabulary would hinder the comprehension of the gist of the text).
Expected Effect of Marking, Reading Task and Time on Incidental Vocabulary Learning
Marking Increases Incidental Vocabulary Learning Several studies indicate that when words are made
salient, this has a positive influence on their acquisition (e.g., Brett, 1998). Moreover, the more glosses
are consulted, the better this might be for vocabulary acquisition (see, e.g., Hulstijn, 1992, who
established a positive influence of glosses on incidental vocabulary learning). The results of the
introductory study tended to confirm this argumentation. I therefore hypothesised that in the marked
condition, students would pick up significantly more words than in the unmarked condition (at least in the
short-term).
A Specific Reading Task Decreases Incidental Vocabulary Learning If it is the case that the specific
reading task decreases the students' willingness to click, and if it is established that increased clicking
results in better vocabulary learning, then this might well cause a slight drawback on vocabulary learning.
Marking Leads to a More Superficial, Short-Term Retention of Vocabulary It is more than likely that
the results of the delayed vocabulary test would be significantly lower than those immediately after
reading, both in the marked and the unmarked condition. However, if, as previous research suggested
Language Learning & Technology

(Black et al, 1992), readers tend to use electronic glosses for short-term purposes only and if in the
marked condition readers are more inclined to consult definitions, then it could be expected that the
results decrease significantly more in the marked than in the unmarked condition (i.e., an expected
interaction effect between time and marking).
Expected Effect of Marking and Reading Task on Text Comprehension
Marking Decreases Text Comprehension Up until now, similar investigations (e.g., Black et al., 1992)
were limited to the aspect of language "acquisition." To my knowledge, no study has looked into the
effects of visible links on text comprehension. I hypothesised that in the marked condition, the attention
of the learners would be drawn towards the highlighted words, which would distract them from the
overall text and its meaning. It is indeed possible that the constant interruption of the reading process in
the marked condition (more intensive clicking) would hinder the students from building up a coherent
representation of the text.
A Specific Reading Task Increases Text Comprehension Since the specific reading task was much more
oriented towards comprehension, the group with this particular task was expected to perform better on
text comprehension than the group with the general reading task.
Expected Additional Effects of Marking
Marking Does not Slow Down the Reading Process As far as reading time is concerned, I originally
assumed that if students click more in the marked than in the unmarked condition, the reading process
would slow down. However, in the introductory experiment no difference in overall reading time could be
established. I expected to confirm these findings in the present experiment.
Marking has a Negative Effect on the Results of the Free Recall The students of the group with the
specific reading task performed a free recall. Its results were expected to be identical to the ones from the
overall comprehension test, since the free recall is considered to be a fully integrated part of it.
Highlighting could thus have a negative effect on the results of the free recall, because excessive clicking
could lead to a poor construction of the text base.
Marking Positively Influences the Results on the Search-and-Find Question The group with the
specific reading task also completed additional search-and-find questions. As far as these questions are
concerned, the students might perform better in the marked condition, since highlighted hyperlinks might
help in skimming a text. For instance, if the students are asked to find the four operations a diamond
undergoes when it is cut, they can hypothesise that either the main category (indicated by the word
operations) or the subcategory (being the operations, i.e., le clivage, le sciage, l'ebrutage, le facettage)
might be highlighted. They can start skimming the text while concentrating on the highlighted words,
which would then make it easier to find the answer to the question. Previous research could not present
conclusive evidence to prove that subjects find a target option faster in a highlighted display than in a
display without highlighting. Some researchers favour the highlighted condition and others the nonhighlighted condition (for an overview of this line of research, see Fisher and Tan [1989]).
Marking Negatively Influences the Concentration Level of the Reader It is not implausible that the blue
highlights also have an impact on the students' level of concentration. In fact, in the interviews concluding
the introductory experiment, the subjects involved even suggested that the highlights distracted them. The
highlighted hyperlinks either attract the readers' attention and by doing so increase the interaction with the
text and thus intensify the reading, or they lead to a more superficial, "click happy" behavior, where text
interaction would be minimal. If students do click excessively in the marked condition and if indeed this
has a negative effect on long-term vocabulary acquisition and overall text comprehension, then the
concentration level of the students in the marked condition might well be significantly lower than in the
unmarked condition. Appendix B, Table 11 offers an overview of the hypotheses and expectations of the
experiment.

METHOD
Subjects
Sixty second-year economics students (university level; 26 females, 34 males) voluntarily participated in
this experiment. These students were between 19 and 21 years of age and none of them had participated
in any previous experiments. All of them were computer literate and were native Dutch speakers. None of
them were bilingual but all had a fairly advanced level of French (9 years of French as a foreign
language). Moreover, they were just finishing up a course of business French incorporated in their
curriculum (30 hours/academic year).
Design
I randomly assigned the subjects to two groups of 30 students each, one with a general reading task, the
other with a specific reading task. Both groups were subjected to a Latin-square design, as clarified in
Table 1. A Latin-square design controls for text and condition order.

Material
Reading Materials The students involved in the experiment read two glossed French economic texts,
comparable in length (about 2,000 words each), grammatical difficulty, and vocabulary load. The texts
had been selected for the introductory study mentioned above, after a pilot study involving four texts, 28
students and two faculty members of French. Within this pilot study, the texts were evaluated for interest
and difficulty level: the two texts with the most similar score were included in the study. The first text
dealt with the diamond industry in Antwerp; the second one was about human resources in business. A
word was glossed whenever one student of the pilot study failed to know the Dutch translation of this
word in a vocabulary test taken after reading. This procedure lead to the creation of 109 glossed words in
the first text and 116 in the second one, which is about 5-6% of the total amount of words. In the existing
literature, there is no consensus on how many unknown words a text may contain in order not to disturb
the global comprehension level or the learning of vocabulary: West (1941) speaks of 2%, whereas for
instance Holley (1973) refers to 7%. Both studies did not include the help of glosses.
The students were asked to read the texts online. They could easily access the glosses by clicking on the
defined word. A pop-up window with a Dutch translation and a French definition (separated with a
horizontal line) would then appear. I chose to offer the translation and the foreign language definition,
since preferences for one or the other are said to be highly individual (Jacobs, Dufon, & Fong, 1994). The
pop-up window did not cover up the portion of the text in which the glossed word was found (see Roby,
1999; Stark, 1990). Context-bound explanations were given first; more general information was given at
the end between brackets. This difference was explained to the students before starting their reading (see
Widdowson, 1978).

Two versions of each text were created: a marked one and an unmarked one. In the marked condition the
glossed words were in blue and underlined. In the unmarked condition the hyperlinks were invisible (i.e.,
the glossed words were typed in black and not underlined; see Appendix A). The glosses remained
identical in both conditions. The texts appeared in a black Times New Roman font, 12 points, on a white
screen. The screen design was based upon the "Recommendations for Basic Typography and Spatial
Factors" of Scott Grabinger & Osman-Jouchoux (1996, p. 194-196). These authors give recommendations
for screen design, based upon both print and computer screen research. In the investigation carried out,
the following aspects were divergent from these guidelines: the full justification (instead of left
justification) and the line length (83 characters). Scott Grabinger and Osman-Jouchoux propose a line
length of 60 characters, while other authors (e.g., Dyson & Kipping, 1998) find an increase in reading rate
with a greater number of characters per line.
Instrumentation and Observation
Clicking Behaviour and Total Reading Time An Internet Explorer specific java-script made it possible
to register how much time the students spent on reading and on clicking. With these log files it could be
determined which glosses the students consulted and for how long they consulted them. The students
were shown how the glosses worked before starting their reading and they were explicitly told to close
each pop-up window after consultation.2
Vocabulary Test After having read each text, the students took an unexpected vocabulary test of 38 items.
All of these items were chosen on the basis of the original pilot study and the glossed words. For every
word of the vocabulary test, the students were asked whether they thought they knew the word a) already
before reading the text or b) from reading the text. In this way, the individual pre-knowledge of the
students could be estimated. I deliberately chose not to include a pre-test in the experiment because in this
particular kind of experiment, testing the students on vocabulary knowledge before they start reading
might direct their reading towards vocabulary. Within this learning indication survey, an "I don't know"
option was also included. This same technique was applied by Hulstijn et al. (1996) in their study on the
combined influence of frequent occurrences and the use of dictionaries/marginal glosses on incidental
vocabulary learning. One week after having read the text, the students took a delayed vocabulary test (the
same items but in a scrambled order) in order to measure any long-term retention of the vocabulary
eventually acquired.
The two texts also contained four non-existent words each. To these words, I attached a self-made,
acceptable, context-bound meaning. 3 In the introductory experiment, only two of these words per text
were included, but an item selection test (included in Cronbach's reliability test) proved that these words
were very good discriminators, hence, the decision to increase their number. I deliberately avoided
working exclusively with non-existent words because of the artificial nature of this procedure. The four
non-existent words of the present study were also used as a means of verification. Since it was impossible
for the students to know these words, these contributed to the clarification of the students' clicking
behaviour and the learning indications that were included in the tests. When scoring the vocabulary test, I
did not take into account the words that at least 70% of the students said they knew before reading the text
(indicated in the learning indication survey) and answered correctly in both of the tests.4
Text Comprehension Test After having read the text, all of the students took a comprehension test of 8
multiple-choice questions and 13 open-ended questions. The reliability scores for this test were rather
low, but could be improved by leaving out some of the items of the test (item selection test, N of cases =
60, Text 1,  = .7021, N of items = 11, Text 2,  = .7351, N of items = 13). The group with the specific
reading task started with a search-and-find task, which was followed by a reading instruction that
specifically described the comprehension test that was to be taken afterwards: the general comprehension
test mentioned above (multiple choice and open-ended content questions) and a summarisation under the
form of a free recall. The tasks in question were chosen on the basis of the work of Wesdorp (1981),

Language Learning & Technology

129

Isabelle De Ridder

Visible or Invisible Links...

Kintsch (1998, p. 295), and Nuttall (1996), who give an overview and a critical evaluation of assessment
techniques for reading comprehension. Several studies on the teaching of reading (e.g., Benitez, Castrillo,
Cerezal, & Suarez, 1988; Nuttall, p.150) propose skimming through a text (stimulated by search
questions) before starting the actual reading as a successful strategy. For an in-depth insight in searchand-do and other possible reading strategies, see for instance Fyfe & Mitchell (1985).
The search-and-find task of this study contained four questions where one or more items had to be found:
three questions could be found literally in the texts, and for the fourth one, the students had to establish a
relationship between information contained in two (not necessarily consecutive) paragraphs. The
reliability scores for the search-and-find task were rather low, but could be improved by leaving out 1
item in each test (see item selection test, N of cases = 30, N of items = 9, Text 1,  = .6979, Text 2,  =
.7077,).
The evaluation procedure of the free recall occurred as follows: For every separate part of the texts, main
and secondary ideas were identified. Whenever a student was able to reproduce a main idea and two or
three secondary ideas, depending on the level of difficulty of that particular part of the text, the student
received 3 points. If s/he only mentioned the main idea without the necessary secondary ideas, the student
was assigned 2 points. Only reproducing the subsidiary ideas entitled the student to 1 point. Students
could obtain a maximum of 34 points for text 1 and 32 for text 2. 5
Concentration Level of the Students To establish a possible difference in the students' concentration
during the reading of the marked versus unmarked text, a small attention test for the group of the specific
reading task was incorporated. During the online reading sessions, a red rectangle (4 to 3 cm, java-script)
randomly appeared (with a maximum of 5 times in the 25 minutes of reading time). The students were
explicitly asked to click on it as fast as possible in order to make it disappear. I expected that the longer it
took the students to react, the higher their concentration level was and the higher their interaction level
with the text they were reading. A similar technique was used in research on writing in order to establish
the subjects' attention capacity (Kahneman, 1973; Kellog & Mueller, 1993).6 The goal of this test is to
disturb the students in their reading, and the longer it takes them to withdraw their attention from the text,
the more they are assumed to be concentrating on their reading.
Additional Information Gathering All 60 students were allowed to take notes while reading so as not to
disturb their normal reading process. They were not, however, allowed to use these notes during any of
the tests. The process data were collected by recording all sessions with Hypercam, a software
programme that registers every on-screen movement and files them in AVI-videofiles. These files were
used as a means of verification. For all 60 students a small interview and some general questions on the
student's reading habits concluded each session. 7
Procedure
All students participated in three individual sessions. Each session was concluded with a small interview
and some general questions. Before reading, the students received a general technical explanation
(working of pop-ups, etc.).
The General Reading Task-Group (Latin-square 1) In the first session, the students of this particular
group read one of the two texts in one of the two conditions, took a test on text comprehension and
completed an unexpected vocabulary test. In the second session, they started with the delayed vocabulary
test of the text of the first session, read the other text in the other condition, took a test on text
comprehension and a finished with a vocabulary test. The delayed vocabulary test of the second session
took place in a brief third session. The 30 students of this group received the following (general) reading
task before reading:

Read the text that will appear on the screen very thoroughly and try to understand as
much as you can. After having read the text, you will receive a test on text
comprehension. You can read as long as you think is necessary.
Thus, no specific time limits were set and no particular information about the testing that would follow
the reading was included. Table 2 gives an overview of the development of the experiment within this
(general reading task) group.

The Specific Reading Task Group (Latin-square 2) In the first session, the students of the specific
reading task group started with a search-and-find task of one of the two texts, in one of the two
conditions. Afterwards, they read the text in question, performed a free recall and took an unannounced
vocabulary test and an announced comprehension test. In the second session, they took a delayed
vocabulary test of the first text and read and completed the tasks of the second text. The delayed
vocabulary test of the second session took place in a brief, third session.
For the search-and-find task, the students received a total of 6 minutes. Afterwards, they were assigned
the following reading task, specifically mentioning the form in which they would be tested:
You will receive 25 minutes to read the text that will appear on the screen. Afterwards,
you will be asked to give an oral overview of what you have read in the text. You will
also receive a comprehension test with multiple -choice and open-ended questions.
As the reader can see, this particular experimental group was subjected to strict time limits, which were
pre-tested with advanced learners and were adjusted to this specific group of learners. The students had
the same comprehension test as the first group and they took the same vocabulary test after the free
recall. 8 In Table 3 one can find an overview of the development of the experiment within the group with
the specific reading task. Activities marked with an asterisk are identical to the ones of Table 2 of the
group with the general reading task.

RESULTS
For an overview of all established results, see Appendix B, Table 12. Within the design of this
experiment, marking and time are within-subjects variables; reading task is a between-subjects variable.
A within-subjects design means that each participant provides more than one response. With a betweensubjects variable, every set of responses comes from a different group of subjects.
Effect of Marking and Reading Task on Clicking Behaviour
Table 4 shows the percentage of time applied to clicking. The results were analysed with marking as a
within-subjects variable and reading task as a between-subjects variable.9 The results show that marking
and reading task have a significant effect on the students' clicking behaviour: marking, F (1,58)=24.292, p
< .05; reading task, F (1,58)=16.331, p < .05. There is no interaction effect between the within-subjects
variable and the between-subjects variable: F (1,58)=0.008, p > .05. These results show that students click
significantly more in the marked than in the unmarked conditions and significantly more in the group
with a general reading task than in the group with the specific reading task. Appendix C, Figure 3
illustrates these results. Marking thus increases clicking and a specific reading task decreases clicking, as
was hypothesised. 10 All statistical tests were performed at the .05 level, unless otherwise indicated.

Effect of Marking, Reading Task and Time on Incidental Vocabulary Learning
Table 5 presents the results of the vocabulary tests, taken immediately after reading and then one week
later. These results were analysed with marking and time (test immediately after reading and delayed test)
as within-subjects variables and reading task as a between-subjects variable. The results show that on one

hand, marking has no significant effect on vocabulary learning: F (1,58)=3.70, p >.05. On the other hand,
time and reading task do have a significant effect on vocabulary learning: time, F (1,58)=10.62, p <.05;
reading task, F (1,58)=28.16, p <.05. There are no interaction effects: marking*reading task, F
(1,58)=0.17, p >.05; marking*time, F (1,58)=2.59, p >.05; time*reading task, F (1,58)=1.30, p >.05;
marking*task*time, F (1,58)=.127, p >.05). Both groups thus score significantly lower in the delayed
vocabulary test. The group with the general reading task scores significantly better on the vocabulary test
than the group with the specific reading task. 11 Appendix C, Figures 4 and 5 illustrate these results. Thus,
marking does not specifically influence incidental vocabulary learning (contrary to what was
hypothesised), whereas a specific reading task does decrease vocabulary learning (as was hypothesised).
Moreover, marking does not lead to more superficial, short-term retention of vocabulary learning, since
there is no significant interaction effect between time and marking (contrary to what was hypothesised).12

Effect of Marking and Reading Task on Text Comprehension
Table 6 shows the results of the overall comprehension test, that is, the multiple -choice questions and the
open-ended questions. These results were analysed with marking as a within-subjects variable and reading
task as a between-subjects variable. The results show that neither marking nor reading task have a

significant effect on the student's text comprehension: marking, F (1,58)=.003, p >.05; reading task: F
(1,58)=.028, p >.05. There is no interaction effect between the within- and between-variable: F
(1,58)=.246, p >.05. Appendix C, Figure 6 illustrates these results. Thus, marking does not decrease
comprehension of the text and a specific reading task does not increase text comprehension (both contrary
to what was hypothesised).

Additional Effects of Marking
Total Time Spent on Reading Table 7 presents the total time in seconds spent on reading, only for the
group with the general reading task, since the group of the specific reading task was subjected to strict
time limits. These results were analysed with marking as a within-subjects variable, showing that there is
no significant effect of marking on the total time spent reading: F (1,58)=1.54, p > .05. Thus, marking
does not slow down the reading process, as was hypothesised.

Free Recall Table 8 shows the results of the free recall performed by the group with the specific reading
task. These results were obtained by averaging the evaluations of two independent researchers who
analysed the transcriptions of the oral recalls produced by the students. Agreement between the scores of
both independent researchers was measured by computing the Pearson product moment correlation
coefficients; for text 1 a .937** correlation was achieved and for text 2 a .974** correlation (= significant
at the .01 level). For issues in measuring reliability, see Hayes and Hatch (1999). These results were
analysed with marking as a within-subjects variable, revealing no significant effect of marking on the free
recall: F (1,29)=1.18, p > .05. These results are thus identical to the results on the overall text
comprehension test: marking does not negatively influence text comprehension.

These results were obtained by counting all correctly found items. The search-and-find task only applies
to the students of the group with the specific reading task. I analysed these results with marking as a
within-subjects variable, which shows that there is a significant difference between the results of the
marked and the unmarked condition: F (1,29)=7.02, p < .05. Marking has a negative influence on the
results of the search-and-find task (contrary to what was hypothesised), since the students score
significantly better in the unmarked condition.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this section, the questions raised in the research aims and rationale section are revisited and discussed
in light of the results of the empirical investigation presented above. The first question posed, which led
to several other questions, was whether highlighted or visible links increase the readers' willingness to
consult dictionary definitions. According to the results of the present study, the answer to this question is
affirmative. The student users consulted significantly more glosses in the condition with visible links.
This finding confirms previous research of Black et al. (1992) concerning first-language acquisition and
shorter texts, where a black spot behind the glossed words also attracted the learners' attention and made

them click to access the provided word definition. Is this particular clicking behaviour altered by the
reading task? The findings of the experiment indicate that students click significantly more in the marked
than in the unmarked condition, be it in the general reading task or the specific reading task group. This
might be an indication of how powerful a tool highlighting is to attract the reader's attention. However,
the study also established that readers click considerably more when they are confronted with a general
reading task than when they receive a specific one, while previous research (Black et al.,1992) seemed to
suggest that a reading task variable does not influence the students' clicking behaviour. It is possible that
the difference between the present results and those of Black et al. are due to the time limits that were
imposed on the students.
Furthermore, does the fact that students spend significantly more time consulting information in the
marked than in the unmarked condition influence the incidental learning of vocabulary? On the shortterm-vocabulary test (taken immediately after reading) no difference was established, which means that
whichever different vocabulary-learning strategy the students used in the two conditions can be
considered equally effective in the short-term. It seems plausible that in the marked condition, students
turn to a vocabulary-learning strategy based upon the reading of dictionary definitions, whereas in the
unmarked condition they use a combination of this particular strategy and context derivation. The
findings of the present experiment indicate that not using highlights thus making the glossed words less
graphically salient, does not particularly influence the incidental learning of vocabulary in a negative way.
In both conditions, the students seemed to have adapted their vocabulary learning strategies to the
marking situation. In the delayed vocabulary test, the students scored significantly lower than in the test
taken immediately after reading. However, the results indicate that in the marked condition, where
students were guided more intensively by the highlights and clicked more excessively, the vocabulary
loss is not greater than in the unmarked condition. The findings thus do not suggest that readers tend to
use electronic glosses for short-term purposes, as the investigations of Black et al. (1992) indicated. The
findings of the investigation presented also establish that the use of either strategy does not slow down the
reading process, since no difference in reading time was found between the marked and the unmarked
condition.
Does the reading task have an effect on the learning of vocabulary? As indicated, reading is often seen in
the research as a pre-eminent means of vocabulary learning. The findings of the empirical research
presented above clearly indicate that the success of this vocabulary learning depends highly on the
reading task that is set. In the experiment, the specific reading task le d to significantly less incidental
vocabulary learning, which is more than probably due to the time pressure and the specific orientation
towards text comprehension.
Did the more intense clicking of the marked condition lead to better text comprehension? Apparently not,
and this might be explained by the link that seems to exist between vocabulary knowledge and reading
comprehension, which was suggested by previous research (Freebody & Anderson, 1983a, 1983b). Since
both conditions result in equal learning of vocabulary, both conditions also result in equal text
comprehension. 13 In the experiment, text comprehension was measured in different ways: on the one
hand, a general comprehension test containing multiple -choice and open-ended questions was used; on
the other hand an additional free recall for the group with the specific reading task was employed. Neither
of these indicated an effect of marking on text comprehension. The search-and-find question, on the other
hand, was subjected to an effect of marking. These results seem to confirm part of the research on
localising items in highlighted and non-highlighted displays. It is possible that the highlights confused the
students and that in the unmarked condition the text structure helped them to find the items they were
looking for.
Did the reading task have an effect on text comprehension? The findings of the current investigation
indicate that, contrary to what was hypothesised, the introduction of the specific reading task did not lead
to a more thorough understanding of the text. This might have been due to the time limits that were set.

The fact that students concentrated more on the text content when they received a specific reading task is
suggested by additional information from the notes they took while reading. In these notes, they wrote
down exclusively content-related items, whereas the other group (general reading task) wrote down more
vocabulary. 14
Are students more concentrated in the unmarked than in the marked condition? Is it possible for them to
interact more intensively with the text in the unmarked condition? The attention test that was introduced
did not reveal any differences in the concentration level of the students.
The results of the current experiment do not all confirm the findings of the previous, introductory
experiment. Globally, the findings are consistent. However, the present ones are much more detailed and
complete (especially on the level of text comprehension). The previous experiment did indicate a better
result on the short-term vocabulary test after reading the texts in the marked condition. Nevertheless,
since the internal consistency scores of the current tests were higher than the previous ones, it may be
assumed that the current results are more reliable. On the other hand, the p-value of this particular effect
is here .059, which is not statistically significant when a 5% level of significance is maintained. However,
I believe that this value indicates that further research might not be redundant.
The fact that no significant effect could be established is perhaps due to the population of the study.
Indeed, the present study was conducted with students who probably have a rather high and advanced
level of French, especially when compared to other cultural backgrounds: they all had 9 years of French
as a second language and live in a country where French is one of three official languages (also Dutch and
German). It is possible that the results would be completely different with students at the beginning or
intermediate level, coming from different cultural backgrounds. It might also be the case that the basic
assumption that more intensive clicking leads to better results on the vocabulary test -- as was suggested
by previous research on glosses -- is one that should be reconsidered. Indeed, when computing the
Pearson product moment correlation coefficient with the results of the vocabulary test and the time
applied to clicking, a .329* correlation was achieved for the marked condition and a .270* correlation for
the unmarked condition (= significant at the .05 level). These are significant but very weak correlations.
Summarising, the present experiment made it possible to evaluate what influence the signalling-mode of
electronic glosses has on vocabulary learning, text comprehension and the reading process. Indeed, when
foreign-language learners read a text where the link with the gloss is visible (highlighted), they are more
willing to consult the gloss. However, this increased clicking does not slow down the reading process, nor
does it increase the vocabulary learned incidentally. On the contrary, when reading a text in a condition
with invisible links, the students' clicking will be less excessive and better determined, leaving room for
context derivation, which, in the long-term however, does not particularly have a positive effect on
vocabulary learning. The fact of highlighting or not highlighting the hyperlink does not have an impact on
text comprehension either. Apparently, the readers seem to adapt their reading strategies and vocabulary
learning strategies to the screen-situation they are confronted with. The reading task then does not alter
the clicking behaviour of the students since they still click considerably more when visible links are
presented, even when carrying out a specific reading task. However, the reading task did influence the
students' vocabulary learning: A content-oriented reading task seems to decrease the reader's attention for
vocabulary.
Nevertheless, in a future follow-up investigation, some issues of the present experiment could still be
improved, for instance, the way in which the study dealt with prior knowledge. I think my reasons for not
including a pre-test in the experiment are defendable. The vocabulary test was based upon results with
similar students and in co-operation with the students' teaching assistants. By asking the students whether
they knew the word before, a means of verification was included. In the end, 30% of the words of the
original vocabulary test was not taken into consideration, yet an internally consistent vocabulary test was
kept with the remaining items. As far as text comprehension is concerned, some questions could not yet

be answered. For instance, no significant correlations could be found between the different text
comprehension tests (i.e., the search-and-find question, the overall comprehension test, and the free
recall). This would imply that somehow these tests have measured other types of comprehension. It
remains to be seen exactly where the differences between the three lie. However, it should not be
forgotten that the Cronbach's alpha values of the free recall were rather low and that therefore the absence
of effects or significant correlations could be due to the unreliability of this particular test.
When listening to all 60 students in the interviews, I realised that different students might have
experienced the different conditions in a different way. Moreover, the videofiles from the Hypercam
reveal that within the group of participating students different reading or learning profiles might have
been involved. Furthermore, the standard deviation (SD) of the percentage of time applied to clicking is
rather high (see Table 4) which is also an indication of differences between the individual students. In a
follow-up investigation, I therefore plan to include aspects of cognitive mapping in the research. The
results of the current research indicate that the learners involved were rather flexible and adapted easily to
the material they were confronted with. However, the question can still be raised whether the users should
adapt to the design of the screen and not the other way around. Visible (highlighted) hyperlinks might be
helpful for some learners while disturbing for others, as far as vocabulary learning, text comprehension
and the reading process are concerned. Students whose learning style is one of external regulation and
step-by-step processing might benefit more from a highlighted condition than students whose learning
style is one of self-regulation and deep-processing (Vermunt & Van Rijswijk, 1987).
The kind of research that involves cognitive flexibility and cognitive profiles would undoubtedly be
useful, especially in the light of today's technological developments. With the advent of Dynamic HTML
for instance, the design of the screen can be instantly adapted to the learning and reading profile of the
user (e.g., Godwin-Jones, 2000). The notion of "usability" (see Nielsen, 2000) is becoming a component
that online educational settings can no longer ignore.

NOTES
1. Other factors seem to have a positive influence on incidental vocabulary learning. Hulstijn et al.
(1996) give a detailed overview of these factors with full bibliographical references.
2. None of the log-times of glosses proved to be enormously long. It is possible that the students left the
pop-up window open while rereading the sentence or while copying vocabulary on paper. However,
these activities can be categorised under "consultation" of a gloss.
3. In text 1 about the diamond industry: cautioler (to guarantee), etre hardele a (to be authorised to), le
desti (the challenge), pourver (to push to extremes). In text 2 about the human capital in business:
eloxer (to remove), mettre en devore (to incite), rummerer (to rime), berluter (to encounter).
4. The vocabulary tests have a very high reliability index (Cronbach's alpha):
Text 1, immediately after reading,  = . 8476; Text 1, delayed,  = .8677, N of items = 38
Text 2, immediately after reading,  = . 8208; Text 2, delayed,  = .8015, N of cases = 60
When applying the filter of pre-knowledge:
Text 1, immediately after reading,  = . 8423; Text 1, delayed,  = .8606,
N of items = 35, N of cases = 60
Text 2, immediately after reading,  = . 8254; Text 2, delayed,  = .8133,
N of items = 30; N of cases = 60
5. The Cronbach's alpha of the free recalls:
Text 1,  = .5709; N of items = 22
Text 2,  = .5862; N of cases = 30

6. These authors propose to confront the students with an auditory signal during writing, on which they
are asked to produce an oral reaction (i.e., say "stop").
7. The results of these general questions and interviews have been analysed but did not reveal any
relevant differences. I have therefore chosen not to report them within the scope of this article.
8. The fact that the free recall was performed before the students took the comprehension test did not
have a facilitating effect on the latter, since correlations between both tests are not significant
(Pearson product moment coefficients: marked, .171; unmarked, .144).
9. All the results were analysed with a General Linear Model (GLM), Repeated Measures (unless
otherwise indicated). This is a Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (an ANOVA for Repeated
Measures). Using the GLM-procedure, one can test null hypotheses about the effects of both the
within-subjects and the between-subjects factors.
10. These results are confirmed when taking into account the percentage of words clicked. The results
show that marking and reading task have a significant effect on the student's clicking behaviour:
marking: F (1,58)=13.992, p < .05; reading task, F (1,58)=14.40, p < .05). There is no interaction
effect between the within-subjects variable and the between-subjects variable. F (1,58)=1.576, p <
.05.
11. For all of the students involved, the vocabulary test of the first session (marked or unmarked) was
completely unexpected. It is possible that in the second session, the students might have expected a
similar test. A GLM Repeated Measures Model including "session" and "time" as within variables
and "reading task" as a between variable yields no significant effect of session, F (1,58)=1.53, p =
.221 > .05; no interaction effects were established, only an effect of time was found, F (1,58)=8.71, p
= .005* < .05.
12. When only taking into account the non-existent words, this results in a (fairly reliable) test where preknowledge is absolutely excluded. Reliability:
Text 1, Cronbach's  = .7426, N of items = 4
Text 2, Cronbach's  = .5773, N of cases = 60
The results on this test have been analysed with a GLM repeated measures and confirm the results of
the overall vocabulary test. The results show that on the one hand, marking has no significant effect
on vocabulary learning, F (1,58)= .311, p >.05. On the other hand, time and reading task do have a
significant effect on vocabulary learning: time, F (1,58)=17.75, p <.05; reading task, F (1,58)=26.40,
p <.05. There are no interaction effects: marking*reading task, F (1,58)=2.10, p >.05; marking*time,
F (1,58)=1.58, p >.05; time*reading task, F (1,58)=.219, p >.05; marking*task*time, F (1,58)=2.62, p
>.05).
13. When computing a Pearson product moment coefficient, the correlation between text comprehension
and vocabulary learning obtained is not all that strong: For the marked condition a correlation of .172
(not significant) was obtained and for the unmarked condition .333** (= significant at the .05 level).
14. Thirty seven out of 60 students took notes: 12 in the group with the general reading task and 25 in the
group with the specific reading task.
