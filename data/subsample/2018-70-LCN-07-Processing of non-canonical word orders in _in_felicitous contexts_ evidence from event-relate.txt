ABSTRACT

In many languages with flexible word orders, canonical word order has a processing advantage over
non-canonical word orders. This observation suggests that it is more costly for the parser to represent
syntactically complex sentences. Alternatively, this phenomenon may relate to pragmatic factors
because most previous studies have presented non-canonical word orders without felicitous
context, which violates participants' expectations regarding the information structure. The present
study conducted an event-related potential experiment to examine the locus of the processing
difficulty associated with non-canonical word orders in Japanese by manipulating word order (SOV
vs. OSV) and the givenness of arguments. The results showed that OSV elicited a sustained left
anterior negativity from O to S and a P600 effect at S compared to that of SOV in the infelicitous
but not in the felicitous context. This result suggests that the processing difficulty of non-canonical
word orders in Japanese is alleviated by discourse factors.

1. Introduction
In real-time sentence comprehension, the parser incrementally constructs various structural dependencies
from a string of successive inputs. Among such dependencies, the processing of filler-gap dependency has
been extensively examined. Behavioural experiments of
many languages with flexible word orders have repeatedly reported that canonical word order has a processing
advantage over other possible derived word orders with
filler-gap dependency (Bader & Meng, 1999; Kaiser &
Trueswell, 2004; Kim, 2012; Koizumi et al., 2014;
Mazuka, Itoh, & Kondo, 2002; Sekerina, 1997; Tamaoka
et al., 2005; Tamaoka, Kanduboda, & Sakai, 2011). For
example, Tamaoka et al. (2005) found that it took more
time to judge whether a sentence makes sense in noncanonical object-subject-verb (OSV) sentences than in
canonical subject-object-verb (SOV) sentences in Japanese. The processing advantage for canonical word
order has also been attested by neurolinguistic evidence,
such as fMRI and event-related brain potentials (ERPs)
(Fiebach, Schlesewsky, & Friederici, 2001, 2002; Fiebach,
Schlesewsky, Lohmann, von Gramon, & Friederici, 2005;

These observations raise the question of why canonical
is preferred over non-canonical word orders in sentence
comprehension. One possible factor is conceptual accessibility ("the ease with which the mental representation of
some potential referent can be activated in or retrieved
from memory", Bock & Warren, 1985, p. 50) (BornkesselSchlesewsky & Schlesewsky, 2009a, 2009b; Kemmerer,
2012; Tanaka, Branigan, McLean, & Pickering, 2011). In
the languages in which an S precedes an O, a conceptually
more accessible agent precedes a conceptually less accessible patient in canonical word orders, whereas the opposite order occurs in non-canonical word orders. Several
studies have reported that prominent entities such as an
agent, animates, concretes, and prototypicals tend to
appear as sentence-initial subjects (cf. Bock & Warren,
1985; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky & Schlesewsky, 2009a; Branigan, Pickering, & Tanaka, 2008; Hirsh-Pasek & Golinkoff,
1996; Primus, 1999; Slobin & Bever, 1982). Accordingly,
the preference for canonical SO order may derive from
the preference for agent-patient order. However, this
hypothesis cannot explain the preference for canonical
word orders in languages in which an S follows an O,
such as Kaqchikel (a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala) and Truku Seediq (an Austronesian language
spoken in Taiwan). Previous behavioural and ERP

experiments have found that canonical VOS order incurred
a lower processing cost compared to that of non-canonical
word orders, such as SVO and VSO in Kaqchikel (Koizumi
et al., 2014; Koizumi & Kim, 2016; Yano, Yasunaga, &
Koizumi, 2017; Yasunaga, Yano, Yasugi, & Koizumi, 2015).
Moreover, an ERP experiment found a larger P600 effect
for the non-canonical SVO than the canonical VOS, irrespective of agent-patient order (i.e. voice alternation) in
Truku Seediq (Yano, Niikuni, et al., 2017). Therefore, the
conceptual accessibility hypothesis does not seem plausible for explaining canonical word-order preference.
Another possibility concerns the syntactic complexities of non-canonical sentences. Since the filler must
be associated with its gap position (Frazier & Clifton,
1989), the storage and integration cost should increase
in non-canonical sentences (Gibson, 1998; 2000). This
hypothesis has been supported by ERP experiments.
For example, Ueno and Kluender (2003) compared the
canonical SOV sentences in (1a) and the non-canonical
OSV sentences in (1b) in Japanese. They found a sustained (bilateral) anterior negativity for "the reckless
adventurer-nom" in OSV compared to SOV. Furthermore,
OSV elicited a phasic P600 effect at the S (adventurerNOM).1 They interpreted their results by assuming that
the parser needed to actively maintain an O in the
working memory and syntactically integrate it with its
original position, reflected by sustained anterior negativity and P600 effects, respectively. An fMRI study conducted by Kim et al. (2009) revealed greater activity at
the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in OVS than in SVO
in Japanese. They also took this increased activity as evidence that syntactic complexity due to filler-gap dependency induces a processing load associated with OSV.

However, most previous studies did not take discourse
factors into account. Canonical word order can be used in
a variety of contexts, while non-canonical order is used in
limited contexts in which discourse requirements are
satisfied. Because previous studies presented non-canonical sentences in isolation, which violated participants'
expectations regarding their information structure, the
extent to which the increased processing difficulty can
be explained by discourse factors remains unclear.

2. Processing of non-canonical word order in
context
The felicitous use of non-canonical word orders has been
suggested to correlate with discourse factors, such as
givenness, as well as sentence-internal, non-syntactic
factors, such as the heaviness of displaced constituents
(e.g. Aissen, 1992; Birner & Ward, 2009; Kuno, 1987,
inter alia). In other words, canonical word order is a
default option for describing an event and occurs in a
wide range of contexts, whereas non-canonical word
order is a marked choice, and its use must be well motivated. Kuno (1978) claimed that scrambling is motivated
by what he called the Information Flow Principle. According to the Information Flow principle, OSV in Japanese is
used felicitously when O refers to discourse-older information than S does. Otherwise, SOV should be preferred
over OSV. Consistent with this view, a corpus analysis
conducted by Imamura (2014) demonstrated that the
O of OSV in Japanese was discourse-old information in
81% of OSV occurrences in the corpus (see also
Imamura, 2015; Imamura & Koizumi, 2011). Furthermore,
in a sentence recall task, Ferreira and Yoshita (2003)
observed that native Japanese speakers tend to
produce ditransitive sentences in the given-new order
when asked to recall those that originally had the newgiven order. These observations support that scrambling
in Japanese is motivated to create a given-new order in a
sentence.
Despite this close correlation, most previous studies
on sentence comprehension examined the processing
of non-canonical structures without felicitous context,
which leads to a confounding of the difficulty of syntactically complex structures and the accommodating
of an unsatisfied discourse requirement. This
problem was discussed in Kaiser and Trueswell
(2004), who conducted a self-paced reading experiment to examine whether the processing difficulty
with non-canonical word order relates to discourse
factors rather than syntactic complexities in Finnish
(see also Clifton C & Frazier, 2004; Grodner, Gibson,
& Watson, 2005; Meng, Bader, & Bayer, 1999; Sekerina,
2003). They presented two context types, as shown in
(2). The supportive context in (2a) referred to an O of
the target sentences in (3b) to license a felicitous use
of OVS, in which O must be discourse-old information
in Finnish, whereas the non-supportive context in (2b)
did not. The result showed no interaction of context
and word order at the V (seurasi "followed").
However, they found a significant two-way interaction
at the NP2 ("hare-part" and "mouse-nom"), due to a
longer reading time in OVS than in SVO only in the
non-supportive context.

A similar interaction of context by word order has
been observed in Japanese. In Japanese, the canonical
word order is SOV. According to transformational syntactic theories, non-canonical OSV sentences involve a fillergap dependency between the fronted O and an associated gap between S and V (i.e. [Oi [S gapi V]]). This
filler-gap dependency is lacking in canonical SOV sentences. Koizumi and Imamura (2017) ran a self-paced
reading experiment using the same factorial manipulation as Kaiser and Trueswell (2004) (i.e. supportive/
non-supportive x canonical/non-canonical word order).
They observed a significant interaction between word
order and context at the NP2. This interaction showed
a larger word-order effect in the unsupportive than in
the supportive context. At the V, only the main wordorder effect was significant, reflecting a longer reading
time for OSV.

These results suggest that the processing difficulty of
non-canonical sentences decreased when their discourse
requirement was satisfied. However, it is not clear from
behavioural experiments how this context effect pertains
to the processing difficulty that has been claimed to be
associated with long-distance dependency formation,
such as the filler storage cost indexed by sustained anterior
negativity and the syntactic integration cost indexed by
P600 in ERP experiments. If these ERP effects are related
to the cost of syntactic dependency formation as has
been suggested, we expect them not to be modulated
by contextual factors. On the other hand, if they reflect discourse-level processing difficulty, we expect that they
would attenuate or disappear in felicitous contexts.

3. Experiment
3.1. Stimuli
The sentences in (6) and (7) show a sample set of experimental context and target sentences, in which two
factors are manipulated: WORD ORDER (SOV/OSV) x GIVENNESS (New-Given/Given-New).

Givenness of arguments was manipulated by presenting an existential sentence, such as in (6), which
referred to either the S or O of the target sentences.
SOV can be used in a wider range of contexts, allowing
given-new or new-given orders. Thus, (7a) did not
violate an information order requirement. OSV, on
the other hand, is a marked word order; thus, it is
used felicitously when O is discourse-given information. The lead-in sentence in (6b) made the OSV in
(7b) felicitous because it mentioned O's referent;
thus, the OS order corresponded to the given-new
order. In contrast, the lead-in sentence in (6a) did not
establish a supportive context for an appropriate use
of OSV in (7b).2
The NPs of the target sentences were common family
names with no bias for particular thematic roles. Temporal adverbs intervened between the S and the O to
increase the memory cost. These NPs and temporal
adverbs were used four times across items, so any ERP
difference was not due to lexical differences between
conditions. Verbs were followed by the modal auxiliary
"rashii" (seem) to avoid the wrap-up effect at the
V. One hundred twenty sets of experimental stimuli
were distributed into four lists, according to a Latin

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

square design, so no participant read more than one sentence from the same set. The lists were counterbalanced
across the participants.

3.2. Prediction
The present study is interested in two types of ERP effects,
namely, sustained left anterior negativity (SLAN) and
P600. SLAN has been observed between the filler and
its original position in scrambled sentences (Hagiwara
et al., 2007; Matzke, Mai, Nager, Russeler, & Munte, 2002;
Ueno & Kluender, 2003), wh-questions (Fiebach et al.,
2001; Phillips, Kazanina, & Abada, 2005), and postnominal relative clauses (King & Kutas, 1995; Muller,
King, & Kutas, 1997). Previous studies have proposed
that it is an index of the working memory load to actively
maintain the filler in working memory (Hagiwara et al.,
2007; King & Kutas, 1995; Kluender & Kutas, 1993;
Matzke et al., 2002; Muller et al., 1997; Phillips et al.,
2005). If this is the case, we expect that SLAN would not
be modulated by givenness (see Discussion). On the
other hand, if it reflects a discourse-level processing
cost to accommodate the discourse requirement
encoded by non-canonical word orders, we predict that
a felicitous context ameliorates it, leading to SLAN's lack.
P600 has been observed at the gap position of fillergap dependency and proposed to reflect syntactic processing difficulty to associate a filler with its original
position (Kaan, Harris, Gibson, & Holcomb, 2000). We
expect no givenness effect if the P600 reflects a syntactic integration difficulty. However, if it relates to a discourse-level processing cost, we predict a P600 in the
infelicitous but not in the felicitous context.
In addition to these ERP effects, we expect a reduced
N400 effect for given NPs at NP1 (S of SOV and O of OSV)
and NP2 (O of SOV and S of OSV) since N400 has been
known to be sensitive to priming effect (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas & Van Petten, 1988). Although it
forms part of the result of statistical analyses reported
below, this effect is of no interest for the present
purpose.

3.3. Procedure
Stimuli were presented in the centre of the monitor in
random order, using Presentation ver. 17.0. (Neurobehavioral Systems). At the beginning of each trial, a fixation
was presented for 1000 ms, followed by a blank screen
for 300 ms. A lead-in context in (6) was presented in its
entirety for 2000 ms with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI)
of 200 ms. After that, each phrase of the target sentences
was presented for 700 ms with 200 ms ISI. A comprehension task was administered at the end of each trial to

1343

check whether our participants understood sentences
correctly. Participants were required to answer questions
(e.g. Is it Mr. Yoshida who forgave Mr. Kimura?), by pressing the "YES" or "NO" button on the response pad
(Cedrus, RB-740). Prior to the main experiment, twelve
practice trials were completed to familiarise participants
with the experimental procedure.

3.4. Electrophysiological recording
EEGs were recorded from 19 Ag electrodes (QuickAmp,
Brain Products) located at Fp1/2, F3/4, C3/4, P3/4, O1/2,
F7/8, T7/8, P7/8, Fz, Cz, and Pz according to the international 10-20 system (Jasper, 1958). Additional electrodes were placed below and to the left of the left eye to
monitor horizontal and vertical eye movements. The
online reference was set to the average of all electrodes
and EEGs were re-referenced offline to the average value
of the earlobes. The impedances of all electrodes were
maintained at less than 10 k throughout the experiment. The EEGs were amplified with a bandpass of DC
to 200 Hz, digitised at 1000 Hz.

3.5. Electrophysiological data analysis
Trials with large artefacts (exceeding 80 V) were automatically removed from the analysis. Two types of analyses were conducted following previous studies on the
processing of filler-gap dependency, namely, cumulative
multi-word and single-word analyses (Fiebach et al.,
2001; King & Kutas, 1995; Phillips et al., 2005; Ueno &
Kluender, 2003, 2009). The cumulative multi-word analysis examined SLAN from NP1 to NP2. The baseline was
set to 100 ms prior to the onset of NP1. The SLAN was
expected to appear after lexical access to NP1 was completed (i.e. approximately 300-500 ms). Hence, for NP1,
SLAN's presence was examined to compare the mean
amplitude of 500-900 ms. The time-window of 300-
500 ms was also tested to examine a priming effect,
although it is not of interest. For the following two
adverbs, the SLAN was assessed by calculating the
mean amplitude from 100 ms after the onset of each
region to the end of the epoch (100-900 ms) (cf. Lau &
Liao, 2018; Phillips et al., 2005).
The single-word analysis examined a P600 at NP2,
which has been associated with the integration cost.
The V region was also examined because some previous
studies reported a P600 for non-canonical word orders.
The baseline was set to 100 ms prior to the onset of
each phrase. The ERPs were quantified by calculating
the mean amplitude for each participant relative to the
baseline using three time windows: 300-500 ms, 500-
700 ms, and 700-900 ms. All EEGs were filtered

1344

M. YANO AND M. KOIZUMI

offline using a 10 Hz low-pass filter for presentation
purposes.
All statistical analyses were conducted separately at
the midline (Fz, Cz, and Pz), lateral (F3/4, C3/4, and P3/
4), and temporal (Fp1/2, F7/8, T7/8, P7/8, and O1/2)
arrays. The midline analysis consisted of repeated
measures ANOVAs with three within-group factors:
WORD ORDER (WO) (SOV/OSV) x GIVENNESS (GivenNew/New-Given) x ANTERIORITY. The lateral and temporal analyses involved four within-group factors:
WO x GIVENNESS x HEMISPHERE (left/right) x ANTERIORITY. When an interaction occurred between WO x GIVENNESS, post hoc analyses were conducted to examine the
effect of WO at each level of GIVENNESS and that of
GIVENNESS at each level of WO. When WO and/or GIVENNESS interacted with topographic factors (ANTERIORITY/
HEMISPHERE), post hoc analyses were conducted at each
level of topographic factors (e.g. front, central, and posterior). The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied
for all effects involving more than one degree of
freedom (Greenhouse & Geisser, 1959). In these cases,
the original degrees of freedom and the corrected
p-value were reported.

3.6. Participants
Sixteen native Japanese speakers were recruited from
Tohoku University (five females and 11 males, M = 20.6,
SD = 1.6, range: 19.2-24.3). All participants were
classified as right-handed based on the Edinburgh handedness inventory (Oldfield, 1971), and three of them had
a left-handed family member. All participants had normal
or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of reading
disability or neurological disorders. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Graduate
School of Arts and Letters, Tohoku University. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants
prior to the experiment, and they were paid for their
participation.

3.7. Results
3.7.1. Behavioural data
The mean accuracy of the comprehension question task
was 87% (SNEWOGIVENV: 87.9%, SGIVENONEWV: 87.5%, ONEWSGIVENV: 85.2%, OGIVENSNEWV: 87.5%). The repeatedmeasures ANOVA showed no significant main effect or
interaction in subject and item analyses (all ps > 0.10).
3.7.2. Electrophysiological data
Multi-word cumulative analysis. Figure 1 shows the
grand average ERP from the onset of NP1 to that of NP2
of the target sentence. Visual inspection of the graph

suggests a striking difference between OSV at the left
frontal sites, with a larger negativity for ONEWSGIVENV.
In the 300-500 ms time-window of NP1, the main
effect of GIVENNESS was significant at all arrays,
showing a larger N400 for the new NPs compared to
the given NPs, due to priming effect (Table 1).
In the 500-900 ms time-window of NP1, the interaction of WO x GIVENNESS x ANTERIORITY was marginally significant at the temporal array. The post hoc
analyses revealed that ONEWSGIVENV showed a larger
anterior negativity than SNEWOGIVENV (Fp1/2: F(1, 15) =
15.41, p < 0.01; F7/8: F(1, 15) = 6.82, p < 0.05), whereas
OGIVENSNEWV did not show a negativity compared to
SGIVENONEWV. Furthermore, ONEWSGIVENV showed a
larger anterior negativity than OGIVENSNEWV (Fp1/2: F(1,
15) = 20.91, p < 0.01; F7/8: F(1, 15) = 15.36, p < 0.01),
whereas the two SOV conditions did not differ. The interaction of GIVENNESS x ANTERIORITY was also significant
at the lateral array and marginally significant at the
midline and temporal arrays, due to a GIVENNESS
effect at the frontal sites (Fz: F(1, 15) = 10.97, p < 0.01;
F3/4: F(1, 15) = 9.83, p < 0.01; C3/4: F(1, 15) = 4.29, p =
0.05; Fp1/2: F(1, 15) = 6.97, p < 0.05; Fp7/8: F(1, 15) =
10.19, p < 0.01).
At ADV1, the three-way interaction of WO x GIVENNESS x ANTERIORITY was significant at the temporal
array. Post hoc analyses revealed that the anterior negativity continued to ADV1 in the ONEWSGIVENV; ONEWSGIVENV
showed a larger anterior negativity than SNEWOGIVENV
(Fp1/2: F(1, 15) = 3.73, p = 0.07), whereas OGIVENSNEWV
did not. Furthermore, ONEWSGIVENV showed a larger
anterior negativity than OGIVENSNEWV (Fp1/2: F(1, 15) =
11.57, p < 0.01). The main effect of GIVENNESS was also
significant, with a larger negativity for the new-given
conditions compared to that of the given-new
conditions.
At ADV2, the only significant effect was the main effect
of GIVENNESS, showing a larger negativity for the newgiven conditions than the given-new conditions.

3.7.3. Single-word analyses
The NP2. Figure 2 shows the grand average ERP of NP2
of the target sentence. Visual inspection of the graph
suggests that ONEWSGIVENV showed a posterior positivity,
but OGIVENSNEWV did not.
In 300-500 ms, the main effect of GIVENNESS was significant in all arrays, due to attenuated N400 for the
given NPs compared to the new NPs (Table 2).3 The
effect of GIVENNESS interacted with ANTERIORITY at
the temporal array, due to a significant GIVENNESS
effect except Fp1/2 (F7/8: F(1, 15) = 6.66, p < 0.05; T7/8:
F(1, 15) = 9.95, p < 0.01; P7/8: F(1, 15) = 13.16, p < 0.01;

GIVENNESS x ANTERIORITY was marginal, which
reflected a significant GIVENNESS effect only at OSV
(P7/8: F(1, 15) = 16.14, p < 0.01; O1/2: F(1, 15) = 13.68, p
< 0.01) and a significant WO effect only at the newgiven condition (P7/8: F(1, 15) = 6.20, p < 0.05; O1/2: F(1,

15) = 6.83, p < 0.05). These results suggest ONEWSGIVENV
showed an early positivity compared to OGIVENSNEWV
and SNEWOGIVENV.
In 500-700 ms, the interaction of WO x GIVENNESS x
ANTERIORITY was significant at the lateral and temporal

arrays and marginally significant at the midline array.
Post hoc analyses showed a significant WO effect only
at the new-given condition at the posterior sites (Pz: F
(1, 15) = 5.67, p < 0.05; P3/4: F(1, 15) = 5.26, p < 0.05; P7/
8: F(1, 15) = 5.30, p < 0.05; O1/2: F(1, 15) = 7.19, p < 0.05).
At OSV, the effect of GIVENNESS was significant or marginally significant at the posterior sites (Pz: F(1, 15) =
5.44, p < 0.05; P3/4: F(1, 15) = 5.62, p < 0.05; O1/2: F(1,
15) = 4.02, p = 0.06). These results indicate that ONEWSGIVENV showed a posterior positivity compared to SNEWOGIVENV and OGIVENSNEWV.
In sum, a robust N400 reduction was observed for the
given NPs at 300-500 ms. Importantly, ONEWSGIVENV elicited an early larger positivity than SNEWOGIVENV,
whereas OGIVENSNEWV did not elicit any effect compared
to SGIVENONEWV.

The verb. Figure 3 shows the grand average ERP of V of
the target sentence.
In 300-500 ms, a significant main effect of GIVENNESS
was observed in the midline and lateral arrays, showing
that the new-given order enhanced an N400 amplitude
compared to the given-new order (Table 3). GIVENNESS
interacted with ANTERIORITY in all arrays, reflecting
that the negativity for the new-given conditions was distributed at the fronto-central sites (Fz: F(1, 15) = 9.90, p <
0.01; Cz: F(1, 15) = 7.40, p < 0.05; F3/4: F(1, 15) = 9.04, p <
0.01; C3/4: F(1, 15) = 4.46, p < 0.05; F7/8: F(1, 15) = 7.08, p
< 0.05; T7/8: F(1, 15) = 6.91, p < 0.05).
The interaction of GIVENNESS x ANTERIORITY was significant at the lateral array and marginally significant at
the midline array at the 500-700 time-window, due to
a GIVENNESS effect at the fronto-central sites (Fz: F(1,
15) = 3.76, p = 0.07; Cz: F(1, 15) = 6.07, p < 0.05; F3/4: F(1,
15) = 3.91, p = 0.06).
In 700-900 ms, the main effect of WO was marginally
significant, showing that OSV elicited a positivity compared to SOV. For the same reason, the interaction of
WO and ANTERIORITY was significant at the lateral

array, with a significant effect at P3/4 and a marginally
significant effect at C3/4 (P3/4: F(1, 15) = 7.67, p < 0.05;
C3/4: F(1, 15) = 4.06, p = 0.06). WO did not interact with
GIVENNESS in any array. However, the planned comparison between SOV and OSV conditions showed a positivity
in the new-given condition (Midline: F(1, 15) = 4.80,
p < 0.05; Lateral: F(1, 15) = 6.03, p < 0.05; Temporal:
Lateral: F(1, 15) = 4.72, p < 0.05), but not in the givennew condition (Midline: F(1, 15) = 0.41, p > 0.10; Lateral:
F(1, 15) = 0.45, p > 0.10; Temporal: F(1, 15) = 0.15, p > 0.10).
Overall, the new-given conditions (SNEWOGIVENV and
ONEWSGIVENV) elicited a larger N400 effect compared to
the given-new conditions (SGIVENONEWV and OGIVENSNEWV). ONEWSGIVENV exhibited a posterior positivity compared
to SNEWOGIVENV at the late time-window.

4. Discussion
The present ERP study aimed to elucidate the processing
difficulties of syntactic complexity and an infelicitous use
of OSV. The result showed an interaction of word order
and givenness of arguments. ONEWSGIVENV elicited SLAN
from O to S compared to SNEWOGIVENV. Importantly,
however, OGIVENSNEWV did not exhibit SLAN compared
to SGIVENONEWV. At NP2, ONEWSGIVENV elicited a significant
P600 effect compared to SNEWOGIVENV. OGIVENSNEWV, on
the other hand, did not show a P600 effect compared
to SGIVENONEWV. These results are discussed in the following sections.

4.1. SLAN effect
ONEWSGIVENV showed a SLAN effect from O to S, in
keeping with the results of Ueno and Kluender (2003),
which presented OSV without context. However, OGIVENSNEWV did not show a comparable SLAN effect. One may
view this difference between ONEWSGIVENV and OGIVENSNEWV as attributable to the number of referents presented to participants by the point of the NP1. In the

new-given order, the participants read two NPs (i.e. an
NP in the context and an NP1) by the NP1. In contrast,
only an NP was presented at this position in the givennew order. If this difference affects SLAN's amplitude,
then we expect only the main effect of GIVENNESS.
This prediction cannot explain an interaction between
WO and GIVENNESS.
The question is why the processing reflected by the
SLAN was costly in the infelicitous but not in the felicitous context. Previous studies on long-distance dependency formation have argued that the SLAN effect
reflects a working memory load of actively storing a
filler, such as a head noun of a relative clause and a
fronted O (Hagiwara et al., 2007; King & Kutas, 1995;
Kluender & Kutas, 1993; Matzke et al., 2002; Muller
et al., 1997; Phillips et al., 2005). If we maintain this functional interpretation, SLAN's lack in the felicitous context
implies that a discourse representation ameliorates the
cost of holding a filler in the working memory in some
way. However, this interpretation is challenged when
we examine more carefully SLAN's functional significance. SLAN has also been observed for lexico-semantically vacuous displaced constituents, such as "wer"
(who-ACC) in German (Thomas asks himself, who-ACC on
Tuesday afternoon after the accident the doctor ___
called has, Fiebach et al., 2002). Kluender and Kutas
(1993) observed a larger SLAN effect for a matrix whquestion (Who have you forgotten ... ?) than a yes-no
question (Have you forgotten ... ?), although they did
not conduct a cumulative analysis. Furthermore,
Wagers and Phillips (2009, 2014) argued that the parser
actively maintains a syntactic category of a filler (e.g.
NP) until encountering a gap, while it releases semantically detailed information from the working memory
and reactivates it after receiving direct evidence for the
location of a gap. Given these findings, a straightforward
interpretation of what SLAN reflects is the active maintenance of a filler's syntactic category rather than
lexico-semantic information. In this interpretation, it is

not clear how discourse-level information alleviates the
memory cost of holding a filler's syntactic category
unless a linking hypothesis exists.
Alternatively, SLAN may reflect the process of manipulating a discourse representation in memory. In ONEWSGIVENV, the processing cost should increase when
encountering a discourse-new O because it has no referent in the preceding context, even though scrambling
presupposes a shared referent in a discourse that directly
or implicitly refers to an O. Accordingly, participants had
to accommodate an unsatisfied presupposition to build a
coherent discourse representation, probably by inventing an additional implicit context that linked the
context and the target sentence. This process may be
reflected by a SLAN observed in ONEWSGIVENV. The
SLAN effect could be similar to the S(L)AN effect elicited
by definite NPs and pronoun in the context with two
salient referents, because the use of these NPs also presupposes a salient referent to which a speaker intends to
refer ("David had asked the two girls to clean up their
room before lunchtime. But one of the girls had stayed
in bed all morning, and the other had been on the
phone all the time. David told the girl ... ", Nieuwland
& Van Berkum, 2006; Van Berkum, 2004; Van Berkum,
Brown, & Hagoort, 1999; van Berkum et al.2003; Van
Berkum, Zwitserlood, Bastiaansen, Brown, & Hagoort,
2004; Van Berkum, Koornneef, Otten, & Nieuwland,
2007).4 In OGIVENSNEWV, on the other hand, the manipulating process is not necessary because the discourse
has already introduced a referent that refers to an O of
OSV, leading to SLAN's lack in the felicitous context.
To date, the extent to which this view can account for previous findings of SLAN effects remains unclear. To our
knowledge, no ERP experiment examines the interaction
of the processing of post-nominal relative clauses by
context. However, given that a behavioural study showed
that their processing was largely alleviated by the felicitous
context (Roland, Mauner, O'Meara, & Yun, 2012), SLAN could
decrease in amplitude due to a felicitous context. Another

1350

observation related to the present view is an LAN effect in
response to the matrix question compared to the yes-no
question (Kluender & Kutas, 1993). Since wh-questions,
such as "What did Mary read?", presuppose the existence
of an entity that Mary read (e.g. Postal, 1971; Karttunen &
Peters, 1976), a wh-question introduced without context
requires receivers to accommodate this presupposition.
Accordingly, the LAN effect in response to a wh-question
(Kluender & Kutas, 1993) could be accounted for in terms
of contextual factors. However, more empirical data needs
to be accumulated to test this view.

4.2. P600 effect at the NP2
At NP2, ONEWSGIVENV elicited a larger posterior positivity
compared to SNEWOGIVEN, whereas no indication exists
of a positivity in response to OGIVENSNEWV. The former
result is consistent with previous studies on scrambling
in Japanese (Hagiwara et al., 2007; Koso, Hagiwara, &
Soshi, 2007; Ueno & Kluender, 2003), as well as those
on filler-gap dependency in other languages (Fiebach
et al., 2001; Fiebach et al., 2005; Kaan et al., 2000; Phillips
et al., 2005; Rosler et al., 1998; Yasunaga et al., 2015; Yano
et al., 2017, Yano, iikuni, et al., 2017). The positivity for
ONEWSGIVENV began to diverge from SNEWOGIVENV earlier
than typical P600 effects. This early peak latency may
be due to the priming effect. When comparing ONEWSGIVENV and SNEWOGIVENV, the critical noun was a discourse-given NP. Accordingly, the repetition priming
facilitated lexico-semantic processing and the subsequent process started earlier. This possibility was supported by the observation that the peak latency of P600
was significantly earlier for the given NPs than the new
NPs (Midline: F (1, 15) = 5.24, p < 0.05; Lateral: F (1, 15)
= 6.01, p < 0.05; Temporal: F (1, 15) = 2.36, p = 0.14).5
Importantly, OGIVENSNEWV did not show a larger positivity
even in the typical P600 time-window. This result of the
WO by context interaction is consistent with the behavioural result by Koizumi and Imamura (2017).
First, it is less likely that the P600 reflects the revision
cost of a syntactic structure. Because an accusative case
was attached to the displaced O of experimental sentences, no S-O ambiguity existed in the present experiment. Furthermore, SLAN's presence for OSV in the
infelicitous context suggests that the parser noticed a
scrambled structure while processing an adverbial
phrase under either interpretation of SLAN discussed
above. Thus, the P600 is not the same as the P600 that
has been observed for garden-path sentences (Kaan &
Swaab, 2003a, 2003b).
Second, Kaan et al. (2000) proposed that P600 reflects
a syntactic integration difficulty. If we hold this view, the
lack of the P600 effect suggests the facilitated syntactic

integration of a filler and its gap. However, a question
arises as to why the discourse givenness of an O
reduces a P600 effect at the NP2. One possibility is that
the syntactic integration difficulty might correlate with
memory cost, because several studies failed to observe
a P600 effect for scrambled sentences in cases in which
the distance between a filler and its gap is relatively
short. For instance, Hagiwara et al. (2007) compared
the processing of middle scrambling with that of long
scrambling, using the sentences in (8) below. They
found that long scrambling elicited a P600 effect compared to the canonical condition, whereas middle scrambling did not (see also Koizumi & Yasunaga, 2017).
Presumably, when the parser consumes less memory
cost, it needs the less syntactic integration cost. In the
present case, since a discourse-given O of OSV did not
impose a memory pressure on the parser, the parser
can integrate the filler with the gap relatively easily. On
the other hand, a discourse-new O was difficult to integrate with the gap because it incurred a memory cost
evidenced by SLAN. However, this conjecture is not consistent with the result of Fiebach et al. (2002) and Phillips
et al. (2005), who reported a P600 effect, irrespective of
the length between a filler and a gap.

Alternatively, the P600 may reflect a conflict resolution of different information types. When scrambled
sentences were not presented with a supportive
context, the parser should have faced a conflict
between syntactic and information structures. That is,
syntactic information signals that the parser must reconstruct a filler at the derived position into the original position to receive a thematic role. However, the information
structure does not validate that the filler is located at the
topic position because scrambling yields an ill-motivated
new-given order. An increasing number of recent ERP
studies have argued that the P600 is not a manifestation
of pure syntactic processing difficulty (e.g. BornkesselSchlesewsky & Schlesewsky, 2008; Brouwer, Crocker,
Venhuizen, & Hoeks, 2016; Brouwer, Fitz, & Hoeks, 2012;
Kuperberg, 2007; Vissers, Chwilla, & Kolk, 2006). Instead,

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

it indexes a process of integrating several types of information, such as syntax and semantics. Thus, a P600 likely
reflects the resolution of a conflict between syntactic
structure and information structure encoded by OSV.
However, the issue of whether the same process
underlies a P600 effect in other languages is not clear,
since, for example, the pre-gap region of relative
clauses in English is a verb, where different types of processes should also be performed, as discussed below.

4.3. P600 effect at the V
At the V, a larger P600 effect was observed for OSV compared to SOV in the new-given condition. The P600 at the
V has been observed in previous studies (Hagiwara et al.,
2007; Weckerly & Kutas, 1999). Phillips et al. (2005) proposed that the P600 at the V reflects "the syntactic and
semantic operations involved in confirming the compatibility of the filler and the verb for thematic role assignment, and compositionally interpreting the verb and its
arguments" (Phillips et al., 2005, p. 425). Because this
process should be necessary at the V of the OSV in Japanese, it explains a P600 effect for OSV in the new-given
context. However, it remains unclear why OSV in the
given-new context did not elicit a similar P600 at V.
The P600 effect in the present experiment contradicts
with the previous ERP experiment of Japanese scrambling that reported a larger anterior negativity for OSV
than SOV at the V (Ueno & Kluender, 2003). However,
this AN effect reflects a wrap-up process that has often
reported in ERP experiments (Friederici & Frisch, 2000;
Osterhout, 1997). In the present study, an auxiliary verb
was placed at the sentence's end to avoid the wrap-up
negativity at the V. As expected, the wrap-up negativity
was observed at the sentence's final region, although
no significant effect existed between conditions.

5. Conclusion
The present study explored the interaction of syntactic
complexity of scrambling and discourse factors during
Japanese sentence comprehension. The result of the
ERP experiment clearly demonstrated that the felicitous
use of scrambling alleviated filler-gap dependency formation, as evidenced by a significant reduction of SLAN
and P600 effects. This finding suggests that the processing
difficulty that has been observed for non-canonical word
orders is largely associated with discourse factors, such as
the alignment of discourse-old and discourse-new NPs.
Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to clarify
the functional significance of SLAN and P600.

Notes
1. They also observed a P600 again at the adverb ("toto"
finally). The successive P600 effects may be due to a temporal ambiguity of an original position of the filler. If the
parser actively attempts to fill a gap (Active Filler Strategy, Frazier & Clifton, 1989), it should perform a gapfilling parsing at S first and do so again at the adverb
after detecting a final gap position.
2. One might wonder whether repeating proper names in
the context and the target sentences sounds unnatural
because they are discourse-old information. However,
Tsuchiya, Yoshimura, and Nakayama (2015) reported
that native Japanese speakers overwhelmingly preferred
the use of referential nouns (e.g. definite NPs) to pronouns in the narrative telling task, unlike in English, in
which pronouns are preferred to refer to a discourseold referent. Hence, the repeated use of proper names
is not problematic in Japanese. However, because the
preceding context renders an NP a topic of a discourse,
marking it with a nominative or accusative case instead
of a topic marker (-wa) is not frequent in Japanese.
However, Hirotani and Schumacher (2011) did not
observe any difference between the nominative and
the topic S when it was mentioned in the preceding
context. Thus, it is unlikely that this affected our results.
Furthermore, the use of a topic marker "-wa" for discourse-given NPs is problematic for the purpose of the
current experiment because this induces an S-O ambiguity. Assuming that the native Japanese speakers disambiguate ambiguous sentences into canonical sentences,
O-waGIVEN S-gaNEW V (O-TOP S-NOM V) should be temporarily
analysed as a canonical SOV sentence until encountering
S. Accordingly, such a sentence should not elicit a SLAN
effect, making it impossible to examine how it is affected
by discourse-level information.
3. In single-word analyses, the ERP of the baseline time
window was analysed to ensure that ERP difference
was not induced as a result of the baseline correction
procedure. The results reveal no significant main effect
or interaction at the baseline time window when the
ERPs were time-locked to the onset of the previous
region.
4. An important caveat is that Nieuwland, Petersson, and
Van Berkum (2007) found an increased activation for a
referentially ambiguous pronoun at the medial prefrontal region, which is different from the left inferior
frontal gyrus that activates during the processing of
non-canonical word orders (Grewe et al., 2007; Kim
et al., 2009; Kinno, Kawamura, Shioda, & Sakai, 2008).
5. The mean peak latency of the positivity was calculated for
each channel with the ERP Measurement Tool of ERPLAB
(Lopez-Calderon & Luck, 2014) by finding a latency in
which the greatest positivity was observed between 300
and 900 ms of NP2. The statistical analyses were conducted in the same way as reported in Section 3.5.
