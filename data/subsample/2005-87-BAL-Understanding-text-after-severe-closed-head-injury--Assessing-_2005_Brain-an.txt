Abstract
A think-aloud method was used to examine the content of information available to working memory during narrative comprehension in a CHI population. Twenty severe CHI participants (>1 year post-injury) and 20 controls talked aloud after they read
each sentence of story narratives. Trabasso and MaglianoOs (1996a) verbal protocol analysis was then used to code for the production of inferential and non-inferential clauses and the memory operations that supported inferential clause production. We found
that CHI and control groups produced a comparable number of clauses, that inferences dominated narrative comprehension, and
that both groups produced more explanatory inferences than predictive or associative inferences. Despite these qualitative similarities, the CHI group demonstrated poorer comprehension, generated proportionately fewer inferences, relied less on retrieval as a
memory source for explanatory inferences, and produced more non-inferential clauses and associative inferences.

1. Introduction
Narrative comprehension refers to the ability of an
individual to understand event-based experiences,
which, for research purposes, is typically presented in
the form of a story (Graesser, Golding, & Long,
1991). This ability is important in our everyday lives
as it allows us to interact within a social environment
that is often dependent upon written words. Although
several studies have shown that individuals who suffer

a closed-head injury (CHI) can experience difficulties
when conveying information comprehension through
the production of coherent, logical discourse (Coelho,
1995; Snow, Jacinta, & Ponsford, 1999), few studies
have directly investigated the reading comprehension
process itself. This is important because the ability to
accurately convey written input depends upon adequate
comprehension of the initial information. Without analyzing the reading comprehension process directly it cannot be determined whether the difficulties experienced
by CHI individuals in conveying comprehension
through discourse are due to problems in understanding
written material or to problems in producing logical discourse. In this study, we more closely examine what
information (from the prior text and world knowledge)
is consciously available in working memory when reading narrative text by using think-aloud methodology
with a severe CHI population.

Think-aloud methods have been used widely in the
cognitive literature to reveal the content of information
available to working memory during reading comprehension (Cote & Goldman, 1999; Graesser, Singer, &
Trabasso, 1994; Magliano, Trabasso, & Graesser,
1999; Trabasso & Magliano, 1996a, 1996b; Zwaan &
Brown, 1996). In a think-aloud procedure, readers are
periodically asked to comment about a text as they progress through it (Ericsson & Simon, 1993). The thinkaloud method has provided insight into the reading
strategies that people use to construct a coherent understanding of presented text (Magliano et al., 1999; Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995). Specifically, two types of
reading strategies have been identified: literal and inferential (Laing & Kamhi, 2002). Research has shown that
readers who employ inferential strategies are more successful in forming coherent narrative comprehension
then those who use literal strategies, such as paraphrasing and repetition (Graesser et al., 1994). This is because
inferences, unlike literal strategies, allow readers to
make causal connections and to go beyond the information presented in the text to understand and remember it
(Langston, Trabasso, & Magliano, 1999).
For readers to adequately create causal connections
between different sections of text, however, readers must
have continued access to previous information within
the text. According to Trabasso and Magliano
(1996a), inferences and memory processes function together to create a coherent, mental representation of
the text. Text comprehension involves explaining incoming story events and actions by looking for causal antecedents of these events in either (a) working memory, or
(b) the prior text (in long-term memory), or (c) world
knowledge. That is, memory processes serve to supply
the information to the reader that is necessary for forming inferences during reading. Because memory operations occur concurrently with inferences, and these
operations rely upon the retrieval of text from the story,
research has identified memory as being an important
component of the narrative comprehension process
(Graesser et al., 1994; Trabasso & Magliano, 1996a).
This suggests that deficits in memory could adversely affect inference production and comprehension by limiting the ability of readers to generate causal connections.
Trabasso and Magliano (1996a) developed a thinkaloud protocol analysis that allows for identification of
not only the kinds of inferences made during reading
comprehension but also the memory sources for the
inferences. More specifically, the Trabasso and Magliano (1996a) protocol analysis distinguishes between
three general categories of inferences: predictions, associations, and explanations. Predictive inferences are forward oriented in narrative time as they speculate about
possible occurrences, actions, or events that may happen
later in the story. Associations are concurrent in narrative time with respect to the focal sentence, and typically

these inferences make generalizations or provide more
elaborative or descriptive detail (e.g., a characterOs
age). Explanations are backward oriented in narrative
time as they provide responses to why a story event or
action has occurred (Laing & Kamhi, 2002; Trabasso
& Magliano, 1996a). The Trabasso and Magliano
(1996a) protocol analysis also distinguishes between
three, functionally distinct, memory operations that
make information available to working memory. These
memory operations include the activation of general
world knowledge, the maintenance of text information
in working memory, and the retrieval of a previously
generated knowledge base of inferences from a longterm memory representation of the text. Together inferences and memory operations are postulated to help
readers establish a coherent narrative structure during
comprehension by solidifying story elements (Trabasso
& Magliano, 1996a).
Studies have consistently shown that explanations are
the most frequent inference type produced by readers
while thinking-aloud (Laing & Kamhi, 2002; Trabasso
& Magliano, 1996a; Zwaan & Brown, 1996). Trabasso
and Magliano (1996a) further demonstrated that the
majority of inferences involve newly activated relevant
world knowledge (57%) as the memory operation.
Maintenance of text in working memory accounted for
36% of the inferences, while retrieval of previously generated thoughts from long-term memory accounted for
only 7% of the inferences as a source. Importantly,
regardless of the memory operation used to make the
inference, explanations predominated. This is consistent
with the notion that deep comprehension is guided by
explanatory reasoning (Graesser et al., 1994; Trabasso
& Magliano, 1996a).
Also consistent with the notion that comprehension is
largely explanation based is the finding that less skilled
readers generate significantly fewer explanatory inferences than skilled readers (Laing & Kamhi, 2002; Trabasso & Magliano, 1996b). Less skilled comprehenders
have also been found to generate more associative inferences (Trabasso & Magliano, 1996b; Whitney, Ritchie,
& Clark, 1991) and to have poorer access to prior text
than skilled readers (Gernsbacher, Varner, & Faust,
1990). Because associative inferences tend to be based
on knowledge activated via semantic relations with individual words in a sentence, associative inferences can
cause the reader to activate irrelevant information and
to focus on the focal sentence rather than on how the
sentence is related to the larger discourse context
(Magliano & Millis, 2003; Whitney et al., 1991). Readers
who use more explanatory inferences, which appear to
unite propositions in a story so the reader can construct
a coherent mental representation of the text, have been
shown to exhibit better memory and understanding for
what they read (Magliano et al., 1999; Trabasso &
Magliano, 1996b). Trabasso and Suh (1993) found that

M. Schmitter-Edgecombe, J.W. Bales / Brain and Language 94 (2005) 331-346

explanations proved to be the best predictor of longterm retention of story information. These findings suggest that when an individual is able to maintain sentences in working memory and relate the focal
sentence to the larger discourse context, they will likely
remember more information.
Much of the CHI research in the area of narrative
comprehension has been conducted using discourse production paradigms (Hartley & Jensen, 1991; Liles, Coelho, Duffy, & Zalgens, 1989). These paradigms involve
asking participants to carry on a conversation, generate
a story, retell a story, or describe a series of pictures.
These studies have shown that individuals with CHI
experience significant difficulties when producing coherent, logical discourse designed to convey their comprehension of the presented information (Coelho, 1995;
Snow et al., 1999). Several researchers have linked these
difficulties to executive deficits (Channon & Crawford,
2000; Coelho, 1995), as discourse production studies require individuals to have adequate cognitive skills for
initiation, organization, and sequencing of the events
they are being asked to relate. Thus, the increased load
on cognitive functions imposed by discourse production
tasks could influence the CHI patientsO ability to demonstrate adequate comprehension.
The few studies that have more directly evaluated
reading comprehension skills as opposed to discourse
production skills have primarily examined CHI participantsO ability to assess the relative salience of information within text (Haut, Petros, & Frank, 1990, 1991).
Despite overall poorer recall of text by CHI participants, these studies found that CHI participants are sensitive to the overall semantic structure of short stories.
Specifically, similar to controls, CHI participants recalled the main ideas of the stories better than the details
(Haut et al., 1990, Haut, Petros, & Frank, 1991). These
findings suggest that while CHI participants may process narrative text information in a manner generally
similar to controls, they are unable to retain it at the
same level as controls.
In terms of the general neuropsychological literature,
recent functional neuroimaging studies and studies with
focal brain injured patients suggest that the left-frontal
lobes contribute to inference production (Ferstl,
Guthke, & von Cramon, 2002; Ferstl & von Cramon,
2001). For example, using a coherence judgment task,
Ferstl et al. (2002) found that the presence of a left-frontal lesion was more predictive of a deficit in inference
performance than was right hemisphere brain damage
(RBD). Although individuals with RBD have been
found to exhibit impairments in inference production
(e.g., Beeman, 1993; Bihrle, Brownell, Powelson, &
Gardner, 1986; Brownell, Potter, Bihrle, & Gardner,
1986), sampling issues (e.g., RBD patients with prefrontal damage) and material selection confounds (e.g., use
of social and pragmatic information) have called into

333

question the hypothesis of an inferencing deficit related
to RBD (Ferstl et al., 2002; Lehman-Blake & Tompkins,
2001). Left-frontal lesions have been postulated to cause
impairments in text comprehension whenever executive
functions such as structuring, sequencing, integrating
information, and inhibiting inappropriate interpretations, are needed during the processing of verbal material (Ferstl et al., 2002).
In this study, we used think-aloud methodology and
the protocol analysis of Trabasso and Magliano
(1996a) to examine inference production and memory
sources during reading comprehension in a CHI population. CHI and control participants read narrative text
and were required to think-aloud following each sentence of the stories. Comprehension for the stories was
assessed with true/false questions. We expected that
the CHI participants would show poorer comprehension
and respond correctly to fewer of the true/false questions than controls. By analyzing the CHI participantsO
think-aloud protocols we were able to more directly
examine how the stories were being processed. We
hypothesized that if CHI participants are less skilled
comprehenders than controls, then they should produce
fewer inferences and display a greater incidence of literal
strategies. In addition, because explanatory inferences
are considered the key component to cohesive comprehension, CHI participants should generate fewer of the
explanatory type of inferences and more associative
inferences compared to controls. Furthermore, due to
the memory deficits that commonly follow CHI (Levin,
1989; Vanderploeg, Crowell, & Curtiss, 2001), we expected that CHI participants would exhibit greater difficulty accessing information presented previously in the
text and would therefore produce fewer inferences that
rely upon information from long-term memory or working memory as the memory source.
As a secondary goal of this study, we were interested
in factors that might be related to ability to generate
inferences. Clearly, language abilities must be sufficient
to construct an accurate situational model of the causally linked propositions. In addition, to establish links
with the focal sentence one needs to be able to encode
and retain the contents of prior sentences. Tests related
to working memory, long-term memory, and executive
functions have all been found to correlate significantly
with inferencing performance (Channon & Crawford,
2000; Ferstl et al., 2002). Given that explanatory inferences require constructing causal connections between
actions and events in the story, we hypothesized that
measures of working memory capacity and long-term
memory might be related to the amount of explanatory
inferences generated. Furthermore, because the leftfrontal lobes have been shown to contribute to inference
processes and the frontal lobes are a common site of
damage following CHI (Adams et al., 1989; Wilson,
Hadley, Wiedmann, & Teasdale, 1995), we were also

interested in evaluating the relationship between executive functions and inferencing abilities.

2. Method
2.1. Participants
Twenty individuals (7 females, 13 males) who had
sustained a severe CHI and 20 neurological normal controls (8 females, 12 males) participated in this study. The
majority of CHI participants were identified through patient records obtained from a regional traumatic brain
injury rehabilitation program in Spokane, WA. Others
were recruited through presentations made at several
head injury support groups. This experiment was completed along with a battery of neuropsychological tests,
and the CHI participants received feedback regarding
their cognitive functioning in return for their time.
Participants were considered to have suffered a severe
CHI if careful retrospective clinical inquiry revealed a
self-reported post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration
of 7 days or longer. Seventy percent of the CHI participants reported a PTA duration of more than 14 days,
and 50% of more than 28 days (M = 74.05 days;
SD = 109.94; range = 7-390 days). In addition, review
of medical records revealed a coma duration of greater
than 24 h or a Glasgow Coma Scale (Teasdale & Jennett, 1974) of 8 or less for all but two participants.1
Most of the CHI participants (N = 14) suffered their
head injuries from a motor vehicle accident; the remaining six injuries resulted from a fall (N = 5) of greater
than 10 feet and from a bicycle accident (N = 1). Such
high velocity and long acceleration impacts typically result in a large percentage of diffuse axonal injuries
(Adams, Graham, Murray, & Scott, 1982). All CHI participants were assessed at least 1 year following injury
(range 1-21 years); 65% were more than 2 years post-injury, and 25% were more than 6 years (M = 5.17 years;
SD = 5.13). To avoid possible developmental effects,
CHI participants were at least 15 years old at the time
of injury (range 15-42 years) and less than 55 years
old at testing (range 16-52 years; see Table 1). Participants were excluded from the study if they had a history
of substance abuse or neurological disorder(s) other
than a CHI. All participants demonstrated adequate visual acuity as indicated by a Snellen ratio of at least 0.50
at a distance of 41 cm.
Five of the control participants were neurologically
normal undergraduate students participating as a
requirement for course credit. The remaining 15 control
participants were recruited from the community through

the use of advertisement. In return for their participation, they received monetary compensation. To increase
the likelihood that the CHI participantsO premorbid abilities were roughly equivalent to those of the controls, the
age (M = 31.40; SD = 10.09; range = 16-52 years) and
educational level (M = 12.80; SD = 1.64; range = 10-
16 years) of the CHI participants was closely matched
to the age (M = 28.85; SD = 10.07; range = 16-51
years) and educational level (M = 13.60; SD = 2.32;
range = 10-20 years) of the control participants. An
estimate of premorbid intelligence derived from the Barona formula (Barona, Reynolds, & Chastain, 1984) revealed that the CHI (M = 103.72; SD = 5.08;
range = 94-112) and control (M = 105.11; SD = 8.18;
range = 90-118) groups did not differ significantly in
premorbid abilities t (38) = .52.
Characteristics of the CHI and control group are presented in Table 1. The data illustrate that the CHI participants were experiencing residual cognitive difficulties.
As can be seen in Table 1, the CHI participants performed more poorly than the controls on tests assessing
attention and speeded processing [Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Smith, 1991], working memory span
[Letter Number Sequencing subtest from the WAIS-III,
Wechsler, 1997], and list-learning and delayed memory
[California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, and Ober, 1987]. In contrast to the above
performances, the groups did not differ significantly on
tests assessing executive functioning [Wisconsin Card
Sorting Test (WCST), Heaton, 1981; Stroop Color and
Word Test, Golden, 1978]. In addition, there were no
significant differences between groups on language tests
assessing confrontation naming [Test of Adult Word
Finding (TAWF), German, 1991] and verbal fluency
[Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT),
Benton and Hamsher, 1976], indicating that the thinkaloud verbal protocols of the CHI participants were
not compromised by word finding difficulties or problems with verbal fluency. During the think-aloud procedure, all CHI participants were able to read and
understand the simple sentences and easily produce spoken language.
2.2. Materials
Participants were presented with two narratives that
each contained 18 sentences. The sentences were typed
separately in the center of 414  512 in cards. Each narrative was a brief story about a character during a holiday
(see Table 2). The first story was about a young girl
named Cathy who wanted a bike for Christmas. The second story was about a young man named Dan who was
traveling home for Thanksgiving. We used stories in this
study because there is evidence that a substantially
greater number of inferences are generated when individuals comprehend stories and other forms of narrative

compared to when they comprehend expository text
(Britton, Graesser, Glynn, Hamilton, & Penland, 1983;
Graesser & Kreus, 1993). Both stories provided ample
opportunity for participants to draw inferences while
reading. The final sentence of each story was also designed to elicit recall of information presented earlier
in the story. Five true/false questions, which inquired
about simple factual knowledge that was explicitly stated in the narratives, were also derived for each story
(e.g., Cathy stood in line for 1 h to see Santa; Dan
was run off the road by a truck).
2.3. Procedure
Each participant completed two, 3-h batteries of
experimental and neuropsychological tasks that assessed
learning and memory abilities. The think-aloud procedure was administered during part one of the two assessment periods. Specifically, participants saw one card at a
time, read each sentence aloud to the examiner, and then
produced verbal reports of any thoughts that occurred
to them while reading the sentences. By stopping participants after each sentence rather than after they had

read a larger unit of text, we can be more certain that
their think-aloud reports most accurately reflected the
contents of their short-term memory (Fonteyn, Kuipers,
& Grobe, 1993; Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995). Our thinkaloud procedure was based on procedures used by
Trabasso and Suh (1993) and Zwaan and Brown
(1996). Specifically, the participants were instructed to
``. . .report whatever thoughts come to mind. Please
report only thoughts that come readily to mind. There
are no ``right'' or ``wrong'' thoughts, but I would
like you to concentrate on thoughts that help you understand the sentence in the context of the story. For example, you might discuss what you think is happening and
report any inferences, predictions, or connections that
you make between current story events and prior story
events. In addition, it is important that you understand
each story because you will later be asked to answer
true/false questions about each story.''
Participants received one practice story, ``Ivan,'' from
Trabasso and Magliano (1996a), prior to completing the
think-aloud method with the two experimental stories. It
has been concluded that thinking aloud is a natural enough process that lengthy training is not required for

Christmas.
She was so happy to be seeing Santa that she hadnOt even

She was even able to have her picture taken with him.
Cathy told him that she wanted a bike for Christmas more

Cathy loved the one her sister had gotten last year.
When Cathy got home that evening, she told her father
about her trip to see Santa.
Her father hadnOt been able to keep from smiling when he
looked at the picture of her sitting on SantaOs lap.
Her father tried to convince her not to get overly excited
this far before Chirstmas.
By the time Christmas Eve arrived, however, Cathy was so
excited that she knew she wouldnOt be able to sleep.
Her parents let her open one present but Cathy couldnOt
keep from feeling a little disappointed when it was a doll.
Cathy felt a little better when she noticed how nice it was.

They had invited quite a lot of relatives over to spend the
evening with them.
Cathy was anxious to see her grandparents and she
thought they would probably get there first.
As soon as they arrived, they went over to talk to Cathy.
They asked her what she most wanted to get for
Christmas.
Dan had been driving all night to get home for
Thanksgiving.

He was starting to fall asleep so he decided to stop and get
some coffee.
He was glad it did because it made him feel much better.
Before long Dan drove past a van parked on the side of the
road.
It was stopped with a flat tire and he couldnOt help but
laugh.
ItsO spare tire must have been underneath everything
because suitcases were strewn everywhere by the side of
the road.
Before long the sun started to come up.
Dan figured he had about 100 miles left to drive.
He hoped heOd be home in only a couple of hours.
While he was driving, his mind wandered and he thought
about how good Thanksgiving dinner was going to be.
Dan hadnOt had a home cooked meal in a couple of
months.
Suddenly, he noticed a track barreling down upon him in
his rear view mirror.
Before he could react, it had run him off the road.

Cl. So, Cathy was wishing for a bike that had a
pink basket.
Cl. A little sibling rivalry.
C1. She told her father about her experience with
Santa Clause that day.
C1. This dad was proud and happy to see his own
daughter happy, just from the picture.
Cl. To keep her excitement to a minimum.

C1. So, Dan was pretty anxious about getting
home.
C2. Because he was probably hungry for good
food.
Cl. It s a good thing.
C2. Because driving when youOre sleepy is bad.
C3. And coffee helps keep you awake.
Cl. Getting caffeine woke him up.
Cl. Dan was probably curious about this creepy
van on the side of the road.
Cl. Probably helped this guy.
Cl. Maybe this car got in an accident of some sort.
C2. There are suitcases all over the side of the
road.
Cl. So, maybe theyOve been there for awhile.
Cl. HeOs getting close to home.
Cl. Maybe heOll speed a little bit to get home.
Cl. He was daydreaming about people, food.

Unfortunately, it sped away so fast that Dan didnOt get a
chance to get the license plate number.
Dan was shaken but not hurt, so he decided to continue his
drive home.
After being back on the road awhile, he saw a diner and
stopped to go inside.
While Dan was sitting there, drinking his coffee, a
policeman came in and started a conversation with him.
He asked what type of vehicle he had seen when the people
were changing their flat.

he didnOt have time to do anything.

persons to be able to carry it out (Ericsson & Simon,
1993). The verbal protocol produced by the participants,
including their responses to the true/false questions,
were tape recorded and later transcribed verbatim for
analysis. Story recall accuracy was determined by totaling the number of true/false questions that the participants answered correctly about the stories.
2.3.1. Think-aloud scoring
The verbal protocols were first broken into clauses,
which constituted the unit of analysis. A clause was defined as a subject, its verb, and any extraneous modifiers. A change in subject or verb that clearly indicated
a new thought by the participant was separated into a
new clause. The number of clauses produced for each
think-aloud story was calculated.2 To analyze participantsO inference abilities each clause was assigned to
one of six categories: a repetition, paraphrase, metacomment, explanation, prediction, or association.
Explanations, predictions, and associations are considered types of inferential statements, while paraphrasing,
repetitions, and metacomments are considered non-inferential statements. A repetition was assigned when a
participant directly reproduced the focal sentence (i.e.,
the sentence that was just read). A paraphrase occurred
if the clause was a transformation of the focal sentence
that preserved its meaning. A metacomment was as-

2
Our method of parsing differed slightly from the method described
by Trabasso and Magliano (1996a). Trabasso and Magliano used a
more fine-grained procedure to parse their protocols into clauses.
Specifically, if a statement contained a main clause and a subordinate
clause, each containing a verb, then it would be parsed into two
statements. For example, ``She has something special'' ``she wants to
ask him for'' would be parsed into two statements by Trabasso and
Magliano, whereas we parsed it into one statement because there was
no change in subject or verb that clearly indicated a new thought by
the participant. After applying the more fine-grained procedure of
Trabasso and Magliano to the first few protocols, we felt that the use
of a less strict parsing procedure allowed us to more appropriately
assign the correct inference and memory operation categories to each
of the clauses.

signed to any personal comment made by a participant
that indicated their own feelings, beliefs, or experiences
that were not dependent upon the information contained within the story (Zwaan & Brown, 1996).
Inferential statements were classified according to the
criteria used by Trabasso and Magliano (1996a). An
explanation was assigned if the clause answered a why
question that the focal sentence implicitly produced. A
prediction occurred whenever a participantOs clause attempted to indicate what might occur further into the
story based upon the information provided within the focal sentence. An association was assigned when a clause
provided further information not inherent within the focal sentence in an attempt to answer who, when, or what
questions that may arise implicitly within the focal
sentence.
The accuracy of inferential statements was also evaluated by judging each response as correct or incorrect. Correct responses were logical utterances that could be clearly
linked to the information contained within the story.
Incorrect inferences did not clearly pertain to the story
or were unreasonable or illogical in the stories context
(Laing & Kamhi, 2002). Poor accuracy was considered
an indication of difficulty with the narrative task.
We also coded the memory operations responsible for
each inference generated using the criteria outlined by
Trabasso and Magliano (1996a). Specifically, each inference was categorized as involving one of three memory
operations: activation, retrieval, or maintenance. Table
2 shows an example text along with the think-aloud
clauses and accompanying inference and memory operation classifications. Activation of relevant world
knowledge is considered a concurrent memory operation as it relies purely upon information contained within the focal sentence. Activation was assigned as the
memory source when participants produced an inferential statement which served only to clarify specifics of
the focal sentence, (e.g., who, what, or when the sentence pertained to). Following the criteria of Trabasso
and Magliano (1996a), activation was also assigned
to any memory operation that was unnecessary for the

338

M. Schmitter-Edgecombe, J.W. Bales / Brain and Language 94 (2005) 331-346

formation of the inference, or any memory operation
that could be assumed given the setting of the narratives.
Maintenance and retrieval are considered backward
memory operations since prior information from the
text is required to formulate the inference in response
to the focal sentence. Any inference generated that included information provided earlier in the narrative
was identified as relying upon maintenance or retrieval.
The difference being the distance the information was
from the focal sentence. Maintenance is thought to be
dependent upon working memory and uses information
that was from the sentence directly before the focal sentence. Retrieval is dependent upon long-term memory
and draws on information that is more then one sentence prior to the focal sentence. In accordance with
the scoring criteria used by Trabasso and Magliano
(1996a), any information contained within the text that
could be assumed based purely upon the setting of the
narrative, or that was unnecessary to the formation of
the inference was not considered to rely on retrieval or
maintenance, but upon activation.
2.3.2. Scoring reliability
Two raters scored all responses independently of one
another. One rater was blind to the grouping of each
individual. The raters agreed on 97.0% of the judgments
as inferential or non-inferential, on 93.1% of the judgments related to type of inference, and on 95.5% of
the classifications of memory source. All disagreements
were subsequently resolved by the two raters reviewing
the records together.
2.3.3. Neuropsychological battery
Standardized neuropsychological tests were used to
assess aspects of working memory, long-term memory,
executive functioning, and language abilities. More specifically, the Letter-Number Sequencing subtest from
the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 1997) was used to assess working memory. Attention and speeded processing were assessed using the Symbol Digit Modality test (Smith,
1991). The California Verbal Learning Task (Delis
et al., 1987) was used to examine learning and delayed
memory. Language based skills were evaluated with
the Test of Adult Word Finding (German, 1991) and
the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (Benton &
Hamsher, 1976). Tests used to assess executive functioning included the Stroop task (Golden, 1978) and the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (Heaton, 1981).

3. Results
3.1. Clauses
All analyses were conducted with data from the two
stories combined. We began by analyzing the total num-

ber of words and the total number of clauses produced
by the CHI and control participants. A t test analysis revealed no difference in the overall number of words
produced by the CHI participants (M = 329.75;
SD = 143.24; range = 135-676) and the control participants (M = 346.95; SD = 181.31, range = 168-706),
t (38) < 1. A t test analysis also revealed no difference
in the overall number of clauses generated by the CHI
(M = 48.50; SD = 15.68; range = 23-90) and control
(M = 50.25; SD = 19.80, range = 26-94) groups,
t (38) < 1. These findings indicate that both groups were
successfully able to produce verbal reports of their
thoughts after reading each of the sentences.
Given the variability in the overall number of clauses
produced by participants within each group, before
comparing the production of inferential and non-inferential statements across groups, we divided the number
of inferential and non-inferential statements by the
number of clauses that each individual produced.3 Inferential statements refer to those statements classified as
explanations, predictions, or associations. Non-inferential statements refer to those statements classified as repetitions, paraphrases, or metacomments. Table 3 shows
a summary of the means, standard deviations, and
ranges for the verbal protocol data of both groups.
A 2 (group) by 2 (clause type) mixed-model analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on the
second factor revealed that the proportion of inferential
statements (M = .76) produced was statistically greater
than the proportion of non-inferential statements
(M = .24), F (1, 38) = 133.73, MSE = .04, p < .01. There
was also a significant group by clause type interaction,
F (1, 38) = 7.30, MSE = .04, p = .01. The proportion of
non-inferential statements generated by the CHI participants (M = .30) was higher than that of controls
(M = .17), while the proportion of inferential statements
produced by the CHI group (M = .70) was lower than
that of controls (M = .83). Individual analysis of the
data also revealed that the verbal protocols of 19 of
the control participants but only 10 of the CHI participants contained at least 70% inferential statements.
These findings indicate that while both groups produced
a higher proportion of inferential than non-inferential
statements, the CHI participants produced fewer inferential statements and a higher proportion of non-inferential statements when compared with controls.
We also examined the number of incorrect inferential
statements made by each group as incorrect statements
generated following each sentence might be an indication of poorer comprehension. Overall, both groups
produced very few incorrect inferential statements.

Correlational analyses revealed that there was no significant
relationship between the number of clauses that participants produced
and the proportion of their statements that were labeled as inferences,
r = .08.

p < .05.

More specifically, a total of 8 incorrect inferential statements were produced by 3 CHI participants and a total
of 6 incorrect inferential statements by 4 controls. Seventeen and sixteen of the CHI and control participants,
respectively, produced no incorrect inferential statements, indicating that both groups showed very accurate
inference generation as they considered each sentence in
turn.

(CHI: M = .46; control: M = .51) inferences produced,
ts < 1.9. Examination of the individual data revealed
that the inferential statements of 9 of the CHI participants but only 2 of the control participants were composed of greater than 25% associative inferences.
These findings indicate that while both groups produced
more explanatory inferences overall, the CHI group was
more apt to produce associative inferences then the control group.

3.2. Inference type
3.3. Source type
The next analysis examined the types of inferences
produced by each group. Before comparing across inference types, we divided the number of explanatory, associative, and predictive inferences by the total number of
inferences that each individual produced. A 2 (group) by
3 (inference type) mixed-model ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of inference type, F (2, 76) = 19.70,
MSE = 0.04, p < .001. Participants produced a greater
proportion of explanatory inferences (M = .49) compared to predictive inferences (M = .29), F (1, 38) =
21.16, p < .01, and associative inferences (M = .22),
F (1, 38) = 28., p < .01. There was also a significant
group by inference type interaction, F (2, 76) = 3.48,
MSE = 0.04, p < .05. Breakdown of the interaction revealed that the CHI group (M = .29) produced significantly more associative inferences than the control
group (M = .15), t (38) = 2.56, p < .05. The groups did
not differ significantly in the number of predictive
(CHI: M = .25; control: M = .33) or explanatory

To analyze memory source types used by participants
for inferential production we examined each inference
type independently. Because participants used all three
types of memory sources when producing explanations
and predictions, we examined proportional data for
these two types of inferences. We did not analyze associative inferences because our data indicates that they
are primarily dependent upon one type of memory
source, activation (see also Trabasso & Magliano,
1996a).
Before comparing the memory sources for explanatory inferences we divided the number of explanatory
retrievals, maintenances, and activations by the total
number of explanatory inferences that each individual
produced. A 2 (group) by 3 (source type for explanations) mixed-model ANOVA revealed a significant main
effect of source type, F(2, 76) = 369.05, MSE = .02,
p < .05. Participants produced a statistically greater

340

M. Schmitter-Edgecombe, J.W. Bales / Brain and Language 94 (2005) 331-346

proportion of explanations that relied upon activation
(M = .77) than explanations that relied upon retrieval
(M = .15), F (1, 38) = 375.01, p < .05, or maintenance
(M = .08), F (1, 38) = 554.61, p < .05. Participants also
produced significantly more explanatory inferences that
relied upon retrieval than upon maintenance,
F (1, 38) = 13.37, p < .05. There was also a significant
group by source type interaction, F (1, 76) = 3.06,
MSE = .02, p = .05, indicating that the CHI group
(M = .11) produced proportionately fewer explanatory
inferences that relied upon retrieval than the controls
(M = .20), t (38) = 2.69, p < .01. The groups did not
differ significantly in their use of activation (CHI:
M = .80, control: M = .74) or maintenance (CHI:
M = .09, control: M = .06) as the memory source,
ts < 1.6. Examination of the individual data revealed
that the proportion of explanatory inferences that relied
on retrieval was greater than 20% for 12 of the control
participants but only 3 of the CHI participants. Furthermore, 5 of the CHI participants but only 1 of the controls failed to produce an explanatory inference that
relied on retrieval. These findings indicate that both
groups relied most heavily upon activation of relevant
world knowledge when formulating explanatory inferences. In addition, compared to controls, the CHI participants generated fewer explanatory inferences that
relied upon information about the text that had been
stored in long-term memory.
A second 2 (group) by 3 (source type for predictions)
mixed-model ANOVA was run to examine memory
sources used for predictive inference production. Again,
before comparing across groups for memory sources we
divided the number of predictive retrievals, maintenances, and activations by the total number of predictive inferences that each individual produced. The
ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of source
type, F (2, 76) = 79.77, MSE = .05, p < .01. Participants
produced a statistically greater proportion of predictions that relied upon activation (M = .68) than
predictions that relied upon retrieval (M = .29),
F (1, 38) = 30.90, p < .01, or maintenance (M = .04), F
(1, 38) = 274.72, p < .01. Participants also produced
significantly more predictive inferences that relied upon
retrieval of information than maintenance, F (1, 38) =
43.67, p < .01. There was no significant group by source
type interaction, F < 1, MSE = .05. These findings indicate that, similar to explanatory inferences, when generating predictive inferences both groups relied more
heavily upon activation of relevant real world knowledge than upon long-term memory for the text or working memory.
3.4. Comprehension questions
Because performance on the comprehension questions was close to ceiling for both groups, the Mann-

Whitney U test was used to evaluate group differences
in the number of errors committed. This analysis revealed that the CHI participants (M = .06, SD = .68)
made a greater number of errors on the true/false questions than the control group (M = .02, SD = .52),
U = 132.00, p < .05. Closer evaluation of the individual
data revealed that 17 of the controls but only 10 of the
CHI participants answered all true/false questions correctly. No participant answered more than two questions incorrectly.
3.5. Correlations for think-aloud method
Since previous studies have shown that inference production, specifically explanatory inference production, is
highly related to narrative comprehension, we compared
our measure of comprehension (i.e., true/false accuracy
about stated information), to both the proportion of
inferences and the proportion of explanatory inferences
generated. No significant correlations were found for
either the CHI group, rs < .14, or the control group,
rs < .37. Our lack of ability to find a significant relationship between comprehension and inference production
may partially reflect the lack of variability in our comprehension measure, as both the CHI (M = .94) and
control (M = .98) groups exhibited near ceiling performances. This high level of accuracy on the true/false
questions suggests that both groups exhibited good
comprehension and that the think aloud procedure
was not hampering participantsO performances. This is
consistent with previous research which has shown that
a think aloud condition facilitates comprehension when
compared to a listen-through condition (Laing & Kamhi, 2002; Trabasso & Magliano, 1996a).
3.6. Correlations for standardized neuropsychological
tests
To further examine those factors that might contribute to the CHI groupsO difficulties on the narrative comprehension test, we conducted correlational analyses.
For each group, we examined the relationship between
the previously identified variables that differed between
the CHI and control groups (i.e., proportion of inferences, proportion of associations, and proportion of
explanatory inferences based upon retrieval) and the
neuropsychological measures of intellectual performance, working memory, speeded processing, memory,
language, and executive functioning listed in Table 1.
Due to the large number of correlations we used a more
conservative a level of p < .01.
For the control group, no significant correlations
were found, rs < .45. For the CHI group, the proportion
of inferences generated and the proportion of explanatory inferences that relied upon retrieval positively correlated with scores on the CVLT list-learning (i.e.,

CVLT recall trials 1-5), rs > .57, and delayed recall (i.e.,
CVLT long delay free recall), rs > .56, measures. As can
be seen in Fig. 1, those CHI participants who exhibited
better learning and memory skills also tended to produce a greater proportion of inferential clauses and to
use information presented earlier in the story when generating explanatory inferences. No other correlations
reached significance, including those related to current
intellectual level, working memory, speeded processing,
language-based skills and executive functioning (see
Table 4).
3.7. Correlational analyses: Injury related characteristics
Correlations were also computed for the CHI group
between injury characteristics (i.e., coma duration,
PTA length, and time since injury) and the neuropsy-

chological measures listed in Table 1. As can be seen
in Table 4, none of the neuropsychological measures
of intellectual performance, working memory, speeded
processing, memory, language skills, or executive functioning correlated significantly with PTA length,
rs < .44, coma duration, rs < .49, or time since injury,
rs < .48. Correlations were also computed between the
injury characteristics for the CHI group and the proportion of inferences, associative inferences, and explanatory inferences that relied upon retrieval. A significant
negative correlation was found between the proportion
of inferences generated and PTA duration, r = .57,
p < .01; with coma length approaching significance,
r = .49, p < .05. As can be seen in Fig. 2, as the severity
of the CHI increased, inference generation tended to decrease. A significant positive correlation was also found
between the proportion of explanatory inferences that

4. Discussion
In this study, we used a think-aloud method to investigate what information (from the prior text and world
knowledge) is consciously available in working memory
during narrative comprehension in a population with severe CHI. Both severe CHI participants and controls
produced verbal reports of any thoughts that came to
mind after reading each sentence of story narratives.
By using the verbal protocol analysis of Trabasso and
Magliano (1996a), we were able to effectively analyze
data production, comprehension strategies, inference
generation, and narrative cohesion, all areas that have
been individually examined but have been difficult to
integrate into a complete analysis of CHI comprehension (Coelho, Liles, & Duffy, 1995; Hartley & Jensen,
1991; Snow et al., 1999).
We found that both the CHI and control groups produced comparable amounts of data (i.e., total number of
words, total number of clauses) on the narrative comprehension tasks. Consistent with prior think-aloud
studies (Trabasso & Magliano, 1996a, 1996b; Trabasso
& Suh, 1993), we also found that inferences dominated
narrative comprehension. This was true not only for
the control group, but also for the CHI group. Moreover, we found that both groups produced proportionately more explanatory inferences compared to
predictive or associative inferences. On average 49% of
the inferences generated were explanatory, which is consistent with previous studies that have typically found
explanatory inferences to account for about 50% or
more of the inferences generated (Graesser et al., 1994;
Trabasso & Magliano, 1996a; Zwaan & Brown, 1996).
Despite the above qualitative similarities in the verbal
protocols of the CHI and control groups, the CHI participants answered fewer of the true/false questions correctly, produced fewer inferences, relied less on retrieval
as a memory source for explanations, and produced
more non-inferential clauses and associative inferences.
These quantitative group differences are unlikely to reflect differences between the CHI and control groups
in lower level language skills, data production, or sentence comprehension. This is because both groups produced comparable amounts of verbal protocol data
and performed similarly on the standardized tests of
confrontation naming and verbal fluency. In addition,
participants in both groups responded well to the
comprehension questions and produced few incorrect
inferential statements. Furthermore, no significant

343

relationship was found between the language-based
measures and inference generation for either the CHI
or the control group.
The data from the CHI participants are generally
consistent with prior research that has compared neurologically normal skilled and less skilled readers. More
specifically, less skilled readers have been shown to have
poorer access to prior text information (Gernsbacher,
1997) and to focus more on the focal sentence (Magliano
& Millis, 2003; Whitney et al., 1991). As a consequence,
they are less likely to form cohesion from sentence to
sentence, a process that facilitates the readerOs ability
to maintain comprehension as the narrative moves forward. We found that the CHI group produced proportionally more non-inferential clauses (i.e., repetitions,
paraphrases, and metacomments) during the thinkaloud method than controls. In previous studies, the
production of non-inferential clause types has been considered characteristic of incomplete comprehension and
reduced textual cohesion (Magliano et al., 1999; Trabasso & Magliano, 1996a, 1996b; Trabasso & Suh,
1993). According to Trabasso and Magliano (1996a)
non-inferential clauses fail to facilitate the formation
of explanatory inferences, the theorized prime driving
force in textual comprehension. In addition, non-inferential clauses like metacomments cannot only derail
the textual cohension process but also result in the inclusion of irrelevant information.
Also consistent with the idea that the control group
may have focused more on global, full text, coherence
than the CHI group, is the finding that the CHI participants produced more associative inferences. Though a
type of inference, associations do not suggest the same
coherent causal connections like explanations (Graesser
& Clark, 1985; Graesser et al., 1994). Rather, associative
inferences tend to be based on knowledge activated via
semantic relations with the individual words in the sentence. For example, Magliano and Millis (2003) found
that, in comparison to skilled readers, when less skilled
readers encountered a sentence that had a perceived
low fit to the narrative they talked more about the focal
sentence than about how the sentence was causally related to the prior text. The increased production of both
non-inferential clauses and associative inferences by the
CHI group may indicate that, in comparison to controls, the CHI group tended to focus more on the focal
sentence rather than on integrating the focal sentence
with the larger discourse context.
Whitney et al. (1991) suggested that less skilled readers tendency to focus more on local, sentence by sentence, coherence as opposed to global, full text,
coherence was due to their inability to maintain information in working memory. Although the CHI group
performed more poorly than the control group on the
neuropsychological measure of working memory, there
was little relation between the working memory measure

344

M. Schmitter-Edgecombe, J.W. Bales / Brain and Language 94 (2005) 331-346

and inference production in the CHI group. Furthermore, the groups did not differ in the proportion of
explanations and predictions that relied on the maintenance of information in working memory as the source.
Therefore, we think it unlikely that group differences in
working memory can account for the CHI participantsO
poorer narrative comprehension and tendency to focus
more on local, sentence by sentence, coherence and we
consider other factors below.
First, given that the CHI participants performed
more poorly than controls on standardized neuropsychological tests assessing learning and memory, one factor to consider is memory difficulties. Theories of textual
comprehension have proposed that when readers integrate a sentence they construct a memory representation
during comprehension that will later be used in retrieval
(Trabasso, Secco, & Van Den Broek, 1984; Trabasso &
van den Broek, 1985). According to Trabasso and
MaglianoOs (1996a) verbal protocol analysis, retrieval
as the memory source for inferences is thought to be
an indication of long-term memory activity. Inferences
that are based on retrieval are also thought to be important to comprehension because they help to establish a
sense of an integrated story. We found that the CHI participants produced significantly fewer explanatory inferences that relied upon retrieval than controls.4 This may
indicate limits on the ability of participants with CHI to
access and apply information stored in long-term memory to the text being considered, which could then lead
to poorer inference generation. In further support of a
relationship between memory abilities and inference
production, the CHI participants who performed poorer
on the learning and memory measures from the CVLT
were also more likely to produce a lower proportion
of inferential clauses and to less often use information
presented earlier in the story when generating inferences.
Another factor to be considered is the relationship
between executive functions and inferencing abilities.
Recently, left-frontal lesions were found to be more predictive of a deficit in inference performance than was
right hemisphere brain damage (Ferstl et al., 2002).
Although there is an association between CHI and dam4

Although the CHI participants produced significantly fewer
explanatory inferences that relied on retrieval than controls, the
groups did not differ in reliance on retrieval as a memory source for
predictive inferences. This may be related to several factors. First, the
overall rates of predictive inferences were lower than those for
explanatory inferences. Second, in contrast to the explanatory inferences that relied on retrieval, the predictive inferences that relied on
retrieval tended to be more focused on the central aspects of the story,
and thus may have been easier for participants to generate. This
difference in difficulty level may have been directly related to the fact
that the last sentence of each story (see Table 2) contained an
anaphoric reference that the entire story was centered upon. That is,
for the majority of participants, the last sentence of each story elicited
a correct prediction that relied on retrieval (i.e., Cathy told her
grandparents about the bike; Dan told the policemen about the van).

age to the frontal lobes (e.g., Mattson & Levin, 1990),
there is not one-to-one mapping. The CHI participants
in this study all suffered from high velocity and long
acceleration impacts which typically result in a large percentage of diffuse axonal injuries (Adams et al., 1982).
Consistent with this pathology of injury, the neuropsychological deficits of the CHI group were most pronounced in the areas of attention, speeded processing,
and memory. The CHI groups performances on the
executive measures did not differ from the performances
of the control group, nor did their executive test performances correlate with the measures of inference generation. For these reasons, we think it less likely that
executive functioning deficits can account for the CHI
groups reduced inference production. We did not, however, have access to structural imaging data on the CHI
participants. Future structural and functional imaging
studies will help to better elucidate the relationship between inference production and reading comprehension.
We also found a negative relationship between inference generation and PTA duration, indicating that
severity of injury was associated with inference production. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed that
both severity of injury and memory abilities contributed
significantly to the prediction of inference production,
and no significant correlational relationship was found
between PTA duration and the CVLT memory measures. This suggests that independent of memory processes, severity of injury may affect inference
production. A significant positive correlation was also
found between time since injury and the proportion of
explanatory inferences that relied on retrieval. Again,
regression analyses revealed that both time since injury
and memory abilities contributed significantly to the
prediction of the proportion of explanatory inferences
that relied on retrieval.
Given the number of factors involved in narrative
comprehension, it may be that more than one agent is
responsible for difficulties with narrative comprehension
following severe CHI. During narrative comprehension
individuals are forced to access information within their
memory stores, process this information to determine its
relevancy to the focal sentence being considered, produce a crude inferential statement concerning the processed data, and finally qualify the produced inference
by attaching extraneous modifiers that link the inference
to some other personal or story element. This complex
process affords a number of opportunities for patients
with CHI to experience difficulties.
The narrative comprehension abilities of the CHI
participants in this study may partially reflect memory
difficulties that resulted in the CHI participants focusing
to a greater extent than controls on the focal sentence
rather than on causally integrating the focal sentence
with the prior text. Although, due to ceiling effects, we
were unable to draw a direct link between decreased

M. Schmitter-Edgecombe, J.W. Bales / Brain and Language 94 (2005) 331-346

inference production and poorer narrative comprehension as measured by the true/false questions, the CHI
participants did answer fewer of the true/false questions
correctly than controls. The true/false questions,
however, probed only for explicitly stated factual information. Future research should focus on applying thinkaloud methods together with testing procedures that
allow for a better assessment of both explicitly stated
factual information and implied or inferred information
contained within narratives. Studies with CHI participants and other brain injured populations have shown
that the main ideas of the stories are typically remembered better than the supporting details (e.g., Haut
et al., 1990, 1991; Nicholas & Brookshire, 1995). In addition, the stories we employed in this study were not designed to elicit specific inference patterns or memory
operations. To more fully elucidate the difficulties experienced by severe CHI participants when processing narratives, it would be ideal to design text that would elicit
different types of inferential processing and see how well
CHI participants perform across varying situations. Another important step to take in future studies would be to
provide more strict instructions to participants to elicit a
more complete sentence structure that would allow lexical analysis for the determination of language skills.
Because adults with CHI can be a heterogeneous
group, these findings should be generalized only to
CHI individuals who meet the same inclusion and exclusion criteria established for this study. Our findings may
not generalize to CHI participants who demonstrate significant deficits in ability to either understand or express
language, who have significant executive functioning
deficits, or who fall within the demented range of cognitive functioning. All participants in this study were more
then 1-year post-injury and future studies are also
needed to better understand those factors that may limit
narrative comprehension abilities in the early phases of
recovery. By gaining a better understanding of the factors that limit narrative comprehension following severe
CHI, we will be in a better position to determine what
areas would be most beneficial to focus on during remediation (e.g., memory, ability to integrate information
across text, and attention).
In conclusion, we found that the think-aloud protocol analysis developed by Trabasso and Magliano
(1996a) can be successfully used to reveal the content
of information (from the prior text and world knowledge) available to working memory when reading narrative text in a severe CHI population. The CHI
participants in this study produced similar amounts of
data as control participants. In addition, inferences, particularly explanatory inferences, dominated their narrative comprehension. Despite these similarities,
compared to controls, the CHI participants answered
fewer of the true/false questions correctly, produced
fewer inferences, relied less on retrieval as a memory

345

source for explanations, and produced more non-inferential clauses and associative inferences.
Much of the narrative comprehension work in the
neurological literature has examined the process of comprehension after it has occurred and then attempted to
identify what factors may have led to the difficulties
experienced by participants. We feel that future studies
should consider both the end product and the process
of comprehension as it occurs. By using the think-aloud
method we were able not only to view the amount of
textual comprehension that occurred after an entire narrative had been considered (i.e., true/false accuracy), but
also the strategies employed by participants during the
process of comprehension (i.e., inference production,
types of inferences, and types of memory sources employed). Continued research in this area should increase
our understanding of those factors that limit narrative
comprehension abilities in brain injured populations
thereby leading to the development of better remediation techniques for improving narrative comprehension
capabilities.
