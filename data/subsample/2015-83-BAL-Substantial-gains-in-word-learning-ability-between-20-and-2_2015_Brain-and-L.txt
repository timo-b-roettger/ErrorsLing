This longitudinal ERP study investigated changes in children's ability to map novel words to novel objects
during the dynamic period of vocabulary growth between 20 and 24 months. During this four-month
period the children on average tripled their productive vocabulary, an increase which was coupled with
changes in the N400 effect to pseudoword-referent associations. Moreover, productive vocabulary size
was related to the dynamics of semantic processing during novel word learning. In children with large
productive vocabularies, the N400 amplitude was linearly reduced during the five experimental learning
trials, consistent with the repetition effect typically seen in adults, while in children with smaller
vocabularies the N400 attenuation did not appear until the end of the learning phase. Vocabulary size
was related only to modulation of the N400 to pseudowords, not to real words. These findings
demonstrate a remarkable development of fast mapping ability between 20 and 24 months.

1. Introduction
As children approach their second birthday, most of them
undergo an increase in the rate of vocabulary acquisition (Fenson
et al., 1994), often termed the ``vocabulary spurt''. In this longitudinal ERP study, we sought to capture age-related changes in children's ability to learn new object-word relations during the
dynamic period of language development between 20 and
24 months. Moreover, we investigated how differences in word
processing during learning related to individual differences in
vocabulary size.
It is often assumed that the vocabulary spurt marks a transition
between two distinct stages of vocabulary acquisition, a change
which has been attributed to qualitative changes such as the emergence of certain word learning constraints (Markman, 1990, 1992),
or the shift from associative to referential acquisition (Nazzi &
Bertoncini, 2003; Nazzi & Pilardeau, 2007), to mention only a few

hypotheses. This account has been challenged by modeling showing that vocabulary growth is often continuous rather than discontinuous (Ganger & Brent, 2004), and it has been proposed that
improvements in domain-general learning abilities can account
for the observed acceleration in word learning (Mayor &
Plunkett, 2010; McMurray, 2007). The fact remains, however, that
vocabulary learning typically undergoes a dramatic acceleration in
the end of the second year, and without assuming two distinct
stages of learning, we will use the term vocabulary spurt to
describe this acceleration. Improving our understanding of the
mechanisms driving this acceleration remains an important focus
of language acquisition research.
A possible contributor to the vocabulary spurt is the emergence
of the ability to map a novel word to its referent from only a few
exposures, a process called fast mapping (Carey & Bartlett, 1978;
Friedrich, 2011). Fast mapping abilities are readily apparent at
the end of children's second year, and the ability has been shown
to emerge already around children's first birthday (Friedrich &
Friederici, 2008; Schafer & Plunkett, 1998; Werker, Cohen, Lloyd,
Casasola, & Stager, 1998; Woodward, Markman, & Fitzsimmons,
1994). Current evidence suggests that the ability to learn words
from limited exposure starts to develop around six months,
although at this point word retention is very weak (Friedrich &
Friederici, 2011). Following this, fast mapping ability continues to
grow more efficient and refined, with longer and better retention,
up until at least 21/2 years of age (Bion, Borovsky, & Fernald, 2013).

1.1. ERP studies of fast mapping and vocabulary development
Electrophysiological studies have successfully used the N400
component to investigate the fast mapping process. The N400 is
a component modulated by lexical priming and/or ease of integration into semantic context, and is elicited by words as well as other
meaningful stimuli (for reviews, see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011;
Lau, Phillips, & Poeppel, 2008). Supporting semantic contexts that
create an expectation of an upcoming stimulus attenuate the
N400 amplitude, which indicates facilitation of lexical-semantic
processing (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). The component has been
observed from 6-9 months of age in picture-word congruity paradigms (Friedrich & Friederici, 2011; Junge, Cutler, & Hagoort, 2012),
but continues to mature up until around 19 years of age (Atchley
et al., 2006; Holcomb, Coffey, & Neville, 1992; Juottonen,
Revonsuo, & Lang, 1996).
The use of the picture-word congruity paradigm is suitable for
studying the process of fast mapping. When children are shown
pictures of unfamiliar objects which are paired with an unfamiliar
pseudoword, it is possible to test the child's ability to map the
novel word to the object after a certain number of presentations.
After familiarization, an incongruity effect on the N400 component
indicates successful fast mapping. Using this paradigm, it has been
shown that 20-month-olds with large productive vocabularies produce an N400 incongruity effect to newly learned pseudowords
presented with incorrectly paired novel objects (Torkildsen et al.,
2008). In this study, each pseudoword was presented with the
same novel object five times in a learning phase, and the test phase
followed immediately at the end of each learning block.
Twenty-month-olds with smaller vocabularies did not show an
effect of incongruity on the N400 amplitude for pseudowords,
although they did produce such an effect in the control condition
using real familiar words and objects. Using a similar task with
lower demands (more learning trials and a slower pace),
Friedrich and Friederici (2008) demonstrated that even
14-month-olds could successfully map novel pseudowords to constantly paired objects and retain this representation for at least a
day. This was seen in a larger N400 response to pseudowords presented with incongruous objects compared to the consistently
paired object. A modified setup of this experiment was used with
6-month-olds and found evidence of learning the pairings between
novel words and objects during the familiarization phase (Friedrich
& Friederici, 2011). However, the 6-month-olds did not produce an
N400 incongruity effect one day later as the 14-month-olds did.
Many other picture-word matching experiments have used real
word/object stimuli familiar to young children rather than novel
objects and pseudowords. Several of these studies have found
interesting links between N400 responses and children's vocabulary development. In one experiment, 12-month-olds who had
high productive vocabularies for their age displayed N400 effects,
while those with lower productive vocabularies did not produce
an effect even for words their parents had rated as comprehended
by the child (Friedrich & Friederici, 2010). Another study found
that the lack of an N400 effect at 19 months predicted poor expressive language skills at 30 months (Friedrich & Friederici, 2006). In a
task adapted for younger infants, 9-month-olds' receptive vocabulary was found to correlate with the size of an N400 effect (Junge
et al., 2012). The lack of an N400 effect in 20-month-old children
with familial risk for dyslexia, compared to a control group, has
also been demonstrated (Torkildsen, Syversen, Simonsen, Moen,
& Lindgren, 2007a). A similar paradigm using purely auditory word
pairs as stimuli (Rama, Sirri, & Serres, 2013) found a relation
between N400 responses and productive vocabulary size.
Together, these findings suggest that the mechanism behind the
N400 response is related to efficient word processing. However,
the study by Torkildsen et al. (2008) described above is the only

one reporting a relation between vocabulary size and the N400
incongruity effect to newly learned pseudowords. The use of pseudowords and fantasy objects is important if one wants to control
for individual differences in previous exposure to word and picture
stimuli, and the types of representations that children might
already have begun to build up based on these experiences.
1.2. Modulation of ERP responses during word familiarization and
learning
The most commonly reported ERP component to show effects of
repetition during word or pseudoword familiarization is a frontal
negative component known as the N200-500, most commonly conceptualized as reflecting processes of word form recognition
(Friedrich, 2011). This component is enhanced in response to
known words compared to unknown words (Mills, Coffey-Corina,
& Neville, 1993, 1997), and has been found to emerge for originally
unknown words as these are repeated and become more familiar
(Kooijman, Hagoort, & Cutler, 2005). The above findings were from
unimodal experiments involving only words, but a few
picture-word priming paradigms have seen a similar effect of an
increased early negativity during familiarization with novel words
paired with pictures (Friedrich & Friederici, 2011; Junge et al.,
2012). Additionally, several studies have found an effect of congruity where words presented with congruous pictures elicited a
larger N200-500 compared to incongruous words (Friedrich &
Friederici, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2006). The N200-500 word familiarity effect in infants has been shown to be related to measures
of language development, such as vocabulary size (Junge,
Kooijman, Hagoort, & Cutler, 2012; Kooijman, Junge, Johnson,
Hagoort, & Cutler, 2013).
Another study, based on the same experiment as Torkildsen
et al. (2008), also focused on the dynamics of the learning phase,
and demonstrated a relation between vocabulary size and the
modulation of the ERP response to the novel words during learning
(Torkildsen et al., 2009). Children with smaller vocabularies and no
evidence of fast mapping in the test phase, showed a different pattern of repetition effects in the training phase than children with
larger vocabularies. The familiarization process was reflected in a
modulation of a fronto-central negativity, which appeared to
increase in amplitude until a certain level of encoding was reached,
and then decrease with further repetition. The children with low
vocabularies, however, did not reach a stage of attenuation of the
negative amplitude due to repetition. This negative component
was interpreted as an Nc, a component seen specifically in infants
and young children in response to several types of stimuli, but
most commonly visual stimuli. It is commonly viewed to reflect
attentional processing, where novel and salient events typically
result in an increase in amplitude (Courchesne, 1978; Csibra,
Kushnerenko, & Grossmann, 2008; Richards, Reynolds, & Courage,
2010), and stimulus familiarization or repetition leads to a
decrease in amplitude (e.g. Quinn, Westerlund, & Nelson, 2006).
While the N200-500 component is elicited by word stimuli specifically, and is believed to be associated with word form processing,
the Nc component seems to reflect more general cognitive mechanisms that are involved in many different types of tasks.
Although the N400 has been studied extensively in infants and
young children with regards to semantic incongruity, it is unclear
how this component changes during the learning process.
Especially in a picture-word matching paradigm where words are
given a clear meaning, one would expect to see changes in N400
amplitude as children learn the associations between the picture
and the word. In adults, the N400 is attenuated with repetition
for both real words and for pseudowords that presumably do not
activate a semantic representation (e.g. Deacon, Dynowska,
Ritter, & Grose-Fifer, 2004; Doyle, Rugg, & Wells, 1996; Petten,

K. Borgstrom et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 33-45

Kutas, Kluender, Mitchiner, & McIsaac, 1991). N400 repetition
effects for words have been reported in school-aged children as
well, and this effect seems to grow stronger with age (De Bruin,
Martens, Glimmerveen, & Van Strien, 2008; Van Strien,
Glimmerveen, Martens, & De Bruin, 2009). While most of the word
learning or word familiarization studies on infants have reported
mainly frontal or fronto-central effects, and not any clear
N400-effects due to repetition, Friedrich and Friederici's (2011)
study with 6-month-olds did find a parietal reduction in negativity
in the second part of the training phase for words that had been
constantly paired with an object compared to words paired with
different objects. They interpreted this as an N400 effect showing
that the children learned the semantic relation between the word
and the object. Other studies of infants and young children have
not reported changes in N400 amplitude with familiarization.
The critical difference between the N200-500 component and the
N400 is that the former does not necessarily involve processing
of the relation between the word form and its referent, which in
experimental contexts is the semantic representation. Instead this
earlier component is mainly modulated by familiarity of a specific
phonological form, regardless of its meaning. The N400 component, on the other hand, is primarily affected by the semantic context, which either facilitates lexical access or makes it more
difficult. Therefore, changes in the N400 component during
repeated word-object presentations should be more indicative of
successful formation of an associative memory representation
encompassing the word and the object.
1.3. Purpose and hypotheses
The research results presented above suggests that the N400
incongruity effect is a sensitive measure of fast mapping ability.
It also seems that measures of change in ERP responses during
familiarization and learning can capture individual differences in
the learning process due to either age or vocabulary. The purpose
of the present study was to investigate the development of electrophysiological responses during fast mapping with a longitudinal
design spanning the period in the second year where most children
undergo a rapid acceleration in vocabulary growth. To this end, we
employed the same paradigm as Torkildsen et al. (2009) and
Torkildsen et al. (2008). In this paradigm pseudowords are linked
to novel pictures through repeated co-presentation, and subsequently the picture-word associations are switched, eliciting an
N400 incongruity response in children who have learned the mappings. In addition, real familiar words and their referents were presented in the same way. Torkildsen et al. (2008) found that
20-month-olds with high productive vocabularies, but not those
with low productive vocabularies, showed evidence of successful
fast mapping as measured by an N400 incongruity effect to the
pseudowords after five learning trials. Both groups, however, produced an N400 effect in the real word condition. A follow-up test at
24 months would be able to show whether these individual differences persist even after the most dynamic time period of the
so-called ``vocabulary spurt''. There have been no longitudinal
studies presenting a pseudoword learning experiment to children
at two time points around this age. Our first hypothesis was that
the size of the N400 incongruity effect to newly learnt pseudowords would predict vocabulary only at 20 months, when many
children would still be in an early, slower period of vocabulary
development. By 24 months, however, many children with low
vocabularies would likely have undergone an acceleration of
vocabulary growth and, although their vocabularies would still
be relatively small, may have attained fast mapping abilities like
those of the high vocabulary group. This would then be reflected
in an N400 incongruity effect which was independent of vocabulary size.

35

Furthermore, we expected that, when grouping children according to their vocabulary size, we would see group differences in
modulation of the N400 component during learning of the pseudowords, which would indicate differences in the process of establishing a link between a novel word and its referent. If such
differences were linked to whether or not the child had undergone
the vocabulary spurt, then they should be most apparent at
20 months, and group differences should diminish at 24 months
when most children would have productive vocabularies above
100 words. By comparing repetition effects on the N400 component with those on the frontal N200-500 component we would
be able to determine whether group differences were due to differences in general word processing, such as familiarity with the word
form, or semantic processing.
In sum, we had the following hypotheses: (1) that the size of the
N400 incongruity effect to newly learned pseudowords would be
related to productive vocabulary at 20 months, but not at
24 months, (2) that an N400 incongruity effect to real familiar
words would be observed at both 20 and 24 months, (3) that an
N200-500 repetition effect would be observed at both ages, independent of vocabulary size or word condition, and (4) that N400
repetition effects during the learning phase would be associated
with vocabulary size, primarily at 20 months when a substantial
number of children would be at a pre-vocabulary spurt stage.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
2.1.1. 20 months
A sample of 77 children (36 boys) were recruited and tested at
20 months of age (3 weeks). The selection criteria were that they
were typically developing monolingual Swedish learners born at
full term (>36 gestational weeks). Reliable electrophysiological
data was obtained from 37 children (17 boys). The remaining participants were excluded from EEG analysis due to fussiness, technical problems, or too few artifact-free trials in one or more of the
analyzed conditions. The children were recruited through child
health care centers in and around Lund, Sweden, and an information campaign sent by mail to all children in certain areas close
to Lund that would fall within the appropriate age range during
the study period. The project was granted ethical approval by the
Regional Ethical Review Board.
2.1.2. 24 months
The same children that participated at 20 months were invited
back at 24 months, and 52 children (24 months 3 weeks) returned
for this second session. In addition, two new children were
recruited at 24 months in order to obtain a larger sample size at
this age. In total 54 children participated in the 24 month session,
and 33 of these were included in the EEG analysis (exclusion from
EEG analysis was due to the reasons stated above). Longitudinal
ERP data was obtained from 23 participants who fulfilled inclusion
criteria at both ages.
2.2. Materials
Different stimulus sets were used in the 20 and 24 months
experiments. The auditory stimulus material consisted of 51 common count nouns, 30 used at each time point (15 artifact labels and
15 animal labels) and 60 pseudowords which were phonotactically
legal in Swedish (30 at each time point). Thus, there was a slight
overlap of nine real words between the two time points, but these
words were paired with different picture referents. Parents
reported that their children comprehended on average 21 of the

36

K. Borgstrom et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 33-45

30 stimulus words at 20 months (range = 10-28), and 26 of the
words at 24 months (range = 6-30). The auditory material was
recorded in an anechoic chamber by a female voice, speaking in
an infant-directed manner. The visual stimuli consisted of cartoon
images of the objects corresponding to the chosen nouns, and fantasy objects and creatures to be paired with the pseudowords,
selected from the web-based collection Clipart (Vital Imagery Ltd.).
Two parent questionnaires were used to assess the children's
general level of development: a Swedish adaptation of
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI
Advisory Board, 2006) - the SECDI (Eriksson & Berglund, 2002) in
the ``Words and Sentences'' version, and the 20 and 24 months versions of a Swedish adaptation of the Norwegian Ages and Stages
Questionnaires (ASQ) (Janson & Smith, 2003; Squires, Potter, &
Bricker, 1999). The ASQ assesses the infant's level of development
in various areas including language and motor development.
2.3. Procedure
Pictures were presented on a 17 inch computer screen
(34  27 cm) approximately 35 cm from the child, and words were
presented from a speaker next to the screen. Children sat on their
parent's lap, with a screen placed around them in order to block
out distractions. Breaks were taken in between blocks if necessary,
with the possibility of showing a short video clip to recapture the
child's attention. EEG was recorded with infant versions of the 128
channel Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Nets (Electrical Geodesics, Inc.)
connected to a Net Amps 300, with a sampling rate of 250 samples/s, referenced to the vertex. The child was video recorded
throughout the experiment, allowing for exclusion of trials where
the child was inattentive.
The stimuli were organized into 10 independent blocks, with
each block containing 3 real words and objects and 3 pseudowords
and novel objects (see Supplementary Material 1 for a graphical
illustration of the experimental design). Each picture-word pair
was presented five times in a pseudo-randomized order. The first
trial in each block was always a real word, there was at least one
interleaved item in between item repetitions, and at most two successive real word trials or pseudoword trials. Each block ended
with a test phase, where the picture word pairings were switched.
Each word/pseudoword was now presented together with one of
the other pictures from the same block, yielding an incongruous
pairing. Real objects were always paired with other real words,
and fantasy objects with other pseudowords. The test phase also
included additional conditions that are not reported in this paper,
where modified versions of the original pictures were presented
with congruous and incongruous words. These conditions were
included to investigate object recognition processes, and results
from this study are reported in Borgstrom, Torkildsen, and
Lindgren (2015). Two different trial lists were created, with the
same stimuli but in different pairings (for the pseudowords and
novel objects) and presentation order. Pictures were presented
for 2150 ms, with a word onset of 1000 ms after each picture onset,
and an inter-trial interval of 500 ms showing a white screen.
2.4. Analysis
2.4.1. EEG processing
Sections of inattentiveness were rejected from the EEG by viewing the video time-locked to the data. A bandpass finite impulse
response filter of 0.3-30 Hz was applied, and 1250 ms epochs
time-locked to word onset were created, with a 100 ms
pre-stimulus baseline. We used an automatic artifact detection
procedure in Net Station 4.5 (Electrical Geodesics Inc.) to mark
large artifacts and bad channels (max-min voltage changes
200 lV), and trials with more than 15 bad channels were rejected.

All trials were then inspected visually and the artifact identification was adjusted so that artifacts caused by eye blinks and eye
movements were left in the data for later correction. Remaining
bad channels were replaced using spherical spline interpolation.
Data was re-referenced to the average of all electrodes (excluding
vertical and horizontal eye electrodes and the nasion electrode). An
average reference has been argued to be the best reference choice
for high-density recordings since it does not bias the signal relative
to a specific reference location (e.g. DeBoer, Scott, & Nelson, 2006;
Picton et al., 2000). We used EEGLAB (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) to
perform an independent components analysis to identify and
remove ocular artifacts, and remaining EEG processing was performed in ERPLAB (Lopez-Calderon & Luck, 2014). Only data from
subjects who retained at least ten artifact-free trials per condition
were included in the grand average and the statistical analyses. The
mean number of accepted trials per condition at 20 months was
between 15 and 17 for all analyzed conditions, and between 14
and 16 at 24 months.
To our knowledge, all studies investigating the effects of word
familiarization or repetition have used electrode montages with a
relatively small number of electrodes referenced to the mastoids
(Friedrich & Friederici, 2011; Junge et al., 2012; Kooijman et al.,
2005; Mills et al., 1993, 1997; Torkildsen et al., 2009). Since this
reference site is relatively close to the brain areas generating the
N400 (see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Lau et al., 2008 for discussion
on possible sources of the N400), it is possible that this procedure
limits the potential to detect more subtle modulations of the N400.
It has been shown that components that have a posterior-temporal
distribution (as the N400) are enhanced in amplitude when applying an average reference compared to a linked mastoids reference,
while frontal components are larger in amplitude using a linked
mastoids reference (Abrams, Westerlund, Hersey, Gustafson, &
Nelson, 2004, in DeBoer et al., 2006). The use of an average reference is generally argued to be advantageous, given a large enough
number of electrodes, since it ``unconfounds estimates of the
amplitude and topography of components with the location of
the reference electrode'' (DeBoer et al., 2006, p. 15). By using a
high-density montage and applying an average reference, we hope
to be able to better separate the frontal N200-500 component
reported in many previous studies and the N400, and investigate
whether word and pseudoword repetition affects the N400 in
infants in a similar way as in adults.
2.4.2. Statistical analysis
Children were divided into two productive vocabulary
groups according to a median split, and this was used as a
between-subject factor in all statistical analyses. Nine regions of
interest (ROI), each including six electrodes, were selected that
covered left, midline, and right sections of frontal, central, and
parietal regions. The mean amplitude for the six electrodes in each
ROI was used in the statistical analyses (channel layout and ROIs
can be seen in Supplementary Material 2). Our hypotheses concerned ERP components that generally emerge between 200 and
800 ms, so statistical analyses focused on this segment of the
ERP. This segment was divided into 200 ms consecutive time windows for initial omnibus repeated measures analyses of variance
(ANOVAs): 200-400, 400-600 and 600-800 ms. The mean amplitude within each time window was used as a statistical measure.
Due to the considerably larger sample sizes that contributed reliable data at each age compared to the sample that contributed data
at both time points, our analyses were primarily conducted on
each age group separately. However, when results seemed to differ
between the age groups, analyses were followed up with an analysis of the longitudinal sample in order to confirm an effect of age.
Results from omnibus level ANOVAs on the longitudinal sample are
provided in Supplementary Material 3.

37

K. Borgstrom et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 33-45

For the effect of repetition during the learning phase, repeated
measures ANOVAs were performed with Word Type (2 levels: real
word, pseudoword), Repetition (5 levels), Region (3 levels) and
Laterality (3 levels) as within-subject factors, and Vocabulary
group (2 levels) as a between-subject factor, for all three time windows and both age groups separately. For the effect of congruity,
the same procedure was performed, replacing the Repetition factor
with a Congruity factor (2 levels). The incongruous trial in the test
phase was compared to the final (5th) congruous trial, at which
point the picture-word associations would be best established.
Follow-up analyses were directed to best capture the two components of interest. The earliest 200-400 ms time window was
used to test the frontal N200-500 word familiarity effect, and the
two later time windows were collapsed to 400-800 ms to test for
the N400 component of semantic processing. This division was
chosen based on previous findings in this age group (e.g.
Friedrich, 2011; Friedrich & Friederici, 2004, 2010; Torkildsen
et al., 2008), as well as visual inspections of the waveforms. The
results section includes ERP waveforms from selected channels in
the ROIs, but detailed topographies in all conditions can be viewed
in Supplementary Materials 4-9. The follow-up analyses were performed on the two word types separately, at specific electrode
regions. In general, only significant effects and certain effects
approaching significance (p < .100) that include the repetition or
congruity factors are reported. An alpha-level of .05 was used for
all statistical tests. The Huyn-Feldt correction was used when
the assumption of sphericity was violated, and in these cases unadjusted degrees of freedom and adjusted p-values are reported
3. Results
3.1. Developmental data
Data from the parent questionnaires are presented in Table 1.
The productive vocabulary groups were formed according to a
median split at each age. At 20 months, the median in the ERP sample corresponded well with the population median (Eriksson &
Berglund, 2002). The low vocabulary group had a maximum score
of 58 words, which is around the common 50- to 75-word threshold often associated with a marked acceleration of productive
vocabulary growth. At 24 months, the sample median was higher
(around the 65th percentile) than the estimated population

median. Development of ASQ scores followed the same general
pattern, where the sample scores were placed below population
medians at 20 months, and above at 24 months (Janson & Smith,
2003). Since this data comes from two different samples, we compared these results with those from the longitudinal sample. The
longitudinal sample showed a similar pattern, with slightly higher
results compared to the reference groups at 24 months than at
20 months, although the longitudinal sample had a median productive vocabulary of just over the 50th percentile (81 words),
which was slightly higher than the entire 20 month sample. At
24 months, the longitudinal sample scored a median in the 70th
percentile. Overall, the data suggest that the present sample had
a steeper growth curve than the reference groups.
3.2. Results from overall ERP ANOVAs
The overall effects of repetition and congruity were tested in
three 200-ms time windows, for each age group separately.
3.2.1. Effects of repetition
As shown in Table 2, effects of repetition were similar at both
ages, a main effect of repetition in all three time windows, and consistent interactions with region. In general, amplitudes over frontal
and central regions became more negative with repetition, while
over parietal regions they were not consistently affected in the earliest time window, but became less negative from 400 ms onward.
Real words and pseudowords did not elicit different repetition
effects in either time window.
3.2.2. Effects of congruity
Congruity effects differed at 20 and 24 months. At 20 months,
the first effects of congruity appeared in the 600-800 ms time window, and there was no main effect of congruity, but an interaction
with word type that indicated an incongruity effect only for real
words. There was also an interaction with region such that parietal
regions showed the largest difference in amplitude between congruous and incongruous presentations. At 24 months, however,
there was a significant interaction between congruity and region
already in the 200-400 ms time window. Moreover, there was a
main effect of congruity from 400 to 800 ms, as well as several
interactions with region and word type. These interactions indicated that for pseudowords there was a larger negativity to

incongruous presentations across all regions, while for real words
only parietal regions had a larger negativity, while frontal regions
had a smaller negativity.
Further analyses, including ERP plots and follow-up statistical
tests on specific regions, are presented for each word type separately. This is motivated both by our theoretical hypotheses and
the omnibus ANOVAs showing both effects of region and word
type.

3.3. ERP responses to pseudowords
3.3.1. Learning phase - effect of repetition
3.3.1.1. 20 months. Over frontal regions there was a positive deflection starting around 200 ms. As the pseudowords were repeated,
this deflection was reduced to baseline and then became more negative, as is characteristic for the N200-500 component (see Fig. 1).
In the 200-400 ms time window, only frontal regions had a

significant effect of repetition, F(4, 140) = 4.82, p = .002, g2p 1/4 :121,
with a significant linear contrast F(1, 35) = 16.30, p < .001,
g2p 1/4 :318, where the mean amplitude became more negative with
repetition. There was no interaction with vocabulary group.
Responses to pseudowords were dominated by a large posterior
negativity peaking around 600 ms, typical of the N400 component.
There was a significant main effect of repetition at parietal regions
between 400 and 800 ms, F(4, 140) = 8.90, p < .001, g2p 1/4 :203, and a
significant linear contrast where the mean amplitude became less
negative with each presentation, F(1, 35) = 27.41, p < .001,
g2p 1/4 :439. Visual inspection suggested that there were differences
between the two vocabulary groups in how the parietal negative
amplitude was modulated by repetition (see Fig. 1). The most
apparent difference was over right parietal channels, where the
high vocabulary group (HV) displayed a clear attenuation of the
N400 amplitude between the first and the third presentation, while
in the low vocabulary group (LV) the amplitude increased between

these conditions, before starting to decrease after the third presentation. Pairwise comparisons (with a Bonferroni correction) of the
first presentation with all subsequent presentations, showed that
the HV group had a significant difference already between the first
and second presentation (p = .037), while the LV group only had
significant differences between the first and fourth (p = .023) and
first and fifth presentations (p = .001). In order to investigate the
relation between vocabulary size and the change in N400 during
the first part of the learning phase, we calculated a difference score
for the mean N400 amplitude between the third and the first
presentations over right parietal electrodes. This change score correlated with vocabulary size, such that a larger attenuation of N400
amplitude due to repetition was related to a larger vocabulary size,
(r = .347, p = .036).
In order to explore the relation between the two components
modulated by repetition, we calculated difference scores between
the first and the fifth presentations, capturing the total change in
amplitude for each individual participant. The change in amplitude
of the N200-500 component (frontal regions between 200-400 ms)
correlated significantly with the change in amplitude of the N400
component (parietal regions between 400-800 ms), r = .484,
p = .002. A larger increase in the N200-500 component was associated with a larger attenuation of the N400 component.
3.3.1.2. 24 months. In the 200-400 ms time window, there were
effects of repetition only over frontal regions, F(4, 124) = 3.21,
p = .017, g2p 1/4 :093, with a linear contrast, F(1, 31) = 14.33,
p = .001, g2p 1/4 :316. The largest effect was between the first and
the second presentation, where the mean amplitude became more
negative, and then there was a smaller increase in negativity
between the third and the fourth presentation (see Fig. 1). There
was no interaction with vocabulary group in either time window.
There was a significant effect of repetition across all five presentations over parietal regions between 400 and 800 ms,
F(4, 124) = 5.49, p < .001, g2p 1/4 :150, following a linear contrast,
F(1, 31) = 10.68, p = .003, g2p 1/4 :256. There was also a near significant interaction between repetition and vocabulary group,
F(4, 124) = 2.32, p = .061, g2p 1/4 :069. When inspecting separate
grand averages for each vocabulary group, the HV group had a clear
reduction in N400 amplitude from the first to the third and to the
fifth presentation, while the LV group had an increase in negativity
between the first and the third presentation across all parietal
regions. The negative amplitude started to decrease after the third
presentation (see Fig. 1). Pairwise comparisons (with a Bonferroni

39

correction) of the first presentation with all subsequent presentations, showed that there was a significant difference already
between the first and second presentation in the HV group
(p = .006), while in the LV group the first presentation did not differ
significantly from any of the subsequent presentations (difference
between 1st and 5th: p = .884). The change in amplitude between
the first and the third presentations correlated significantly with
productive vocabulary (r = .394, p = .023), as was the case at
20 months.
As at 20 months, a larger increase in the N200-500 component
was associated with a larger N400 decrease due to repetition
across the five pseudoword presentations, (r = .464, p = .006).

3.3.2. Switch phase - effect of incongruity
Pseudowords presented with mismatching pictures, were compared to the fifth congruous presentation. At 20 months, responses
did not differ between congruous and incongruous conditions (see
Fig. 2). There were no significant effects of congruity at any electrode site, and no interaction with vocabulary size. At 24 months,
however, there was a greater negativity to incongruous pseudowords across centro-parietal regions starting from approximately 400 ms. At central sites there was a significant main
effect of congruity in the 400-800 ms time window,
F(1, 31) = 14.53, p = .001, g2p 1/4 :319, and no interaction with vocabulary group. At parietal regions, there was no significant effect of
congruity in the 400-800 ms time window, but since the negativity
was long-lasting, we also tested a later time window, 600-
1000 ms. Here there was a significant interaction between congruity and laterality, F(2, 62) = 3.66, p = .032, g2p 1/4 :106, and a
follow-up analysis showed that the right parietal region had a significant effect of congruity, F(1, 31) = 7.08, p = .012, g2p 1/4 :186.
Although the omnibus ANOVA showed a significant interaction
between congruity and region already between 200 and 400 ms
at 24 months, no region had a significant effect of congruity for
pseudowords this early.
Because of the differences between the two age groups, we
performed a longitudinal analysis in both time windows on the
group of children that contributed data at both time points
(n = 23), including age as a within-subject factor (2 levels). In the
200-400 ms time window, however, there was no significant interaction between age and congruity, The analysis in the 400-800 ms
time window confirmed a significant interaction between congruity and age over central regions, F(1, 22) = 5.524, p = .028,

g2p 1/4 :201, while there was no main effect of congruity. Follow-up
analyses on each age group showed that, as in the whole sample,
these longitudinal participants showed no effect of congruity at
20 months, while at 24 months there was a main effect of congruity over central regions, F(1, 22) = 6.90, p = .015, g2p 1/4 :259.
3.4. ERP responses to real words
3.4.1. Learning phase - effect of repetition
3.4.1.1. 20 months. The N200-500 component was seen over frontal
channels, as there was a positive wave starting around 200 ms in
response to the first presentation, which during successive presentations of the words was reduced to baseline and then became
more negative (see Fig. 3). In the 200-400 ms time window, where
there was an effect of repetition in the frontal region,
F(4, 140) = 5.79, p < .001, g2p 1/4 :142, with no interaction with

group,
and
a
significant
linear
contrast,
F(1, 35) = 17.24, p < .001, g2p 1/4 :330, as well as a quadratic contrast,
F(1, 35) = 7.22, p = .011, g2p 1/4 :171. The quadratic effect was due to a
slightly decreased negativity between the third and fifth presentation after an initial larger increase in negativity during the first
three presentations.
Over posterior channels words elicited a large negativity peaking around 600 ms, characteristic of the N400 component (see
Fig. 3). In the whole sample, there was a significant effect of repetition over parietal regions, where the amplitude between 400 and
800 ms was reduced as words were presented repeatedly,
F(4, 140) = 8.82, p < .001, g2p 1/4 0:201. This effect followed a linear
contrast pattern, F(1, 35) = 24.34, p < .001, g2p 1/4 :410. There was
also a significant three-way interaction between repetition, laterality and vocabulary group, F(8, 280) = 2.50, p = .012, g2p 1/4 :067.
Follow-up tests showed that this interaction concerned the left
parietal region, where only the high vocabulary group had a

significant effect of repetition, F(4, 72) = 6.55, p < .001, g2p 1/4 :267
(LV group: F(4, 68) = 1.95, p = .112, g2p 1/4 :103). In separate group
ANOVAs including all parietal regions, both vocabulary groups
had a significant main effect of repetition, LV: F(4, 68) = 3.99,
p = .006, g2p 1/4 :190; HV: F(4, 72) = 5.37, p = .001, g2p 1/4 :230. There
was no correlation between the early N200-500 effect and the later
N400 repetition effect, as was the case for pseudowords at both
ages.
3.4.1.2. 24 months. In the 200-400 ms time window, there was no
main effect of repetition at any region, but a near significant interaction with laterality over frontal regions, F(8, 248) = 2.07, p = .057,
g2p 1/4 :063. The effect of repetition was only significant at right frontal electrodes, F(8, 248) = 2.69, p = .036, g2p 1/4 :080. There was a significant effect of repetition over parietal regions between 400 and
800 ms, F(4, 124) = 3.68, p = .007, g2p 1/4 0:106, where the mean
amplitude became less negative with repetition, confirmed by
the linear contrast, F(1, 31) = 12.06, p < .002, g2p 1/4 :280. There was
no interaction with vocabulary group. In contrast to the measures
at 20 months, the early frontal repetition effect was correlated
with the N400 attenuation, in the same way as for pseudowords
(r = 0.436, p = 0.011).
3.4.2. Switch phase - effect of incongruity
Words presented with mismatching pictures were compared to
the fifth congruous presentation in the learning phase. At both ages
incongruous words elicited a large negativity over posterior sites
peaking around 600 ms (see Fig. 4). The effect of congruity
between 400 and 800 ms was significant over parietal regions at
both ages (20 months: F(1, 35) = 7.92, p = .008, g2p 1/4 :185;
24 months: F(1, 31) = 17.60, p < .001, g2p 1/4 :362). There was no
interaction with vocabulary group at either age. A longitudinal
analysis including age as a within-subject factor confirmed that

there was no interaction between age and congruity, but instead a
strong main effect of congruity over parietal regions in the 400-
800 ms time window, F(1, 22) = 16.53, p = .001, g2p 1/4 :429. As for
pseudowords, there was no effect of congruity at any region in
the 200-400 ms time window, despite an interaction between congruity and region at 24 months in the omnibus ANOVA. There was
also no interaction between age and congruity between 200-
400 ms, when performing a longitudinal analysis.

4. Discussion
4.1. Development of novel word-object mapping from 20 to 24 months
The 24-month-olds in this study differentiated between congruous and incongruous pairings of the pseudowords, indicating
that they had successfully mapped the novel pseudowords to the
novel objects after five exposures. However, there was no such
effect at 20 months, suggesting that at this age the children did
not fully learn the associations between the novel pseudowords
and their referents. Thus, in only four months the children clearly
improved in fast mapping ability. This effect of age was not due to
sample differences, since the pure longitudinal sample showed the
same pattern of development as the full sample. Surprisingly, the
response to incongruity was not related to vocabulary size as in
Torkildsen et al. (2008), where children with large vocabularies
at 20 months did show an N400 incongruity effect when associations between novel pseudowords and referents were broken.
However, an N400 effect was seen in response to familiar real
word-object pairs at both ages, demonstrating that the N400
mechanism with regards to word stimuli was in place, as many
other studies have previously established (e.g. Friedrich &
Friederici, 2008; Junge et al., 2012; Torkildsen et al., 2008). This
incongruity effect for real words was also independent of

vocabulary size. The vocabulary groups in Torkildsen et al.'s
(2008) study followed a 75-word cutoff, which corresponded to
the median-split in the present study. Thus, the present study's
lack of effect of productive vocabulary on the N400 response in
20-month-olds cannot be due to differences in vocabulary size
compared to the previous study (Torkildsen et al., 2008).
It seems reasonable to interpret the incongruity effect to the
pseudowords, with its parietal peak around 600 ms, as an N400
response. However, the topography also showed a more temporally sustained negativity over central regions to the incongruous
pseudowords compared to the real word condition. The central
incongruity effect was statistically significant in an earlier time
window than the effect over parietal regions, which was not significant until after 600 ms. That pseudowords elicited a later parietal
incongruity effect than real words seems reasonable considering
that the pseudowords were newly learnt, and would be expected
to be processed more slowly. The central distribution may indicate
involvement of additional processes in response to the newly
learned pseudowords, perhaps associated with enhanced attention. The negative central (Nc) component is a commonly observed
response modulated by attention, novelty detection and saliency in
young children (see de Haan, 2006 for a review), and might be present in the 24 month sample's response to the incongruous pseudowords. Although the children established a mapping between
the pseudowords and the novel objects, these associations are
likely to be weak compared to the previously familiar real words
and objects. If the children were not confident about the pseudowords' referents, they might have responded with increased
attention to incongruous presentations because they continued
to process these stimuli in an attempt to integrate them into the
context. This would explain that the central negativity to incongruous pseudowords was sustained throughout the epoch, without a
return to baseline. In comparison, when a dog is labeled ``car'' it
might be so obviously incorrect that the children dismiss it more

rapidly. This interpretation is reasonable even without assuming
the involvement of an additional component, the Nc. Instead, it is
possible that the extra resources required to process the novel
pseudowords simply generate an N400 component with a more
widespread topography.
A question that arises is why the 20-month-olds in this
experiment did not respond to the incongruity in the pseudoword
condition when a sample of the same age in Torkildsen et al.
(2008) did, as well as even younger children in a similar paradigm
(Friedrich & Friederici, 2008). In Friedrich and Friederici's (2008)
study, where 14-month-olds produced an N400 to newly learned
pseudowords, a larger number of learning trials were used and
there were also fewer words to be learned (8 trials, and only 8
consistent word-object association) which reduces the demands
compared to the present study. Although five learning trials were
used in the current experiment just as in Torkildsen et al. (2008),
the presentation rate was faster, with a 500 ms inter-trial interval
(ITI) compared to 1000 ms ITI used in both Torkildsen et al.
(2008) and Friedrich and Friederici (2008). Speed of word processing is a measure of linguistic maturity, and thus a faster presentation rate may have presented too much of a challenge to the
younger children's processing capacities (see Fernald &
Marchman, 2012; Fernald, Perfors, & Marchman, 2006). We also
only presented one incongruous trial per item in the test phase,
while the previous experiment included two trials per item. This,
along with the additional trials presenting modified pictures in
the test phase (see the methods section) may have increased the
demands in this experiment and made it too difficult for the
20-month-olds to build up specific expectations about which words
would follow each picture.
Vocabulary size was not related to the magnitude of the N400
incongruity effect in any of the conditions in this experiment.
Previous research have reported mixed results, with some studies
showing that better language skills in young children were related
to a larger N400 semantic priming effect to real words (Friedrich &
Friederici, 2004, 2006, 2010; Junge et al., 2012; Rama et al., 2013;
Torkildsen et al., 2007a), while others report no such relation
(Friedrich & Friederici, 2005a; Torkildsen, Syversen, Simonsen,
Moen, & Lindgren, 2007b; Torkildsen et al., 2008). Similarly, studies using eye tracking measures of word comprehension have
shown that differences in the efficiency of online processing of real
words are associated with differences in vocabulary size (e.g.
Fernald & Marchman, 2012; Fernald et al., 2006). Torkildsen et al.
(2008) is the only study to report a correlation between productive
vocabulary and an N400 effect to newly learned pseudowords
specifically. The difference in demands of the task is the most likely
explanation that this result was not replicated. At 20 months, the
task was probably too difficult for most of the children, regardless
of vocabulary size, while at 24 months, it is possible that most
children had attained a similar ability of fast mapping, such that
vocabulary size was no longer a relevant dimension of differentiation. Even the low vocabulary group at 24 months had a quite
substantial productive vocabulary, with a mean of 173 words.
Only four subjects at 24 months had vocabularies under 75 words,
which is considered a common milestone of the vocabulary spurt.
According to our hypothesis that receptive fast mapping ability is a
relevant factor underlying the acceleration of productive vocabulary growth that takes place around 75 words, we had not expected
a relation between vocabulary size and an N400 effect to newly
learned pseudowords at 24 months. Moreover, individual differences in productive vocabulary size are caused by many factors
other than fast mapping ability, such as language exposure, and
even if receptive fast mapping ability is one contributing factor,
it may be outweighed by others.
The data on vocabulary size, as well as general development
measured by the ASQ, indicated that the children participating in

this study had a slightly steeper growth curve than the reference
groups for the instruments. Particularly, they advanced from
vocabularies around the 50th percentile at 20 months to the 70th
percentile at 24 months. This may be associated with the relatively
high educational level of the parents that chose to participate. It is
possible that this accelerated growth curve influenced the results
in the sense that the neural changes we see in four months in
the present sample may be somewhat more protracted in a sample
with an average vocabulary growth.
4.2. Dynamics of word familiarization
During familiarization of both real words and pseudowords,
repetition affected the same two components. The first was an
early frontal response starting around 200 ms, which can reasonably be interpreted as an N200-500 component. There was an initial positivity in response to the first presentations of both words
and pseudowords which changed to an increased negativity as
the stimuli were repeated. This effect is in line with results from
previous studies (Friedrich & Friederici, 2011; Kooijman et al.,
2005; Mills et al., 1993, 1997) and is commonly interpreted as an
effect
of
word
form
recognition
and
facilitated
lexical-phonological processing following familiarization (see
Friedrich, 2011 for a review). However, in addition to word form
processing, the N200-500 component has been linked to semantic
processing, as it in some cases has been sensitive to word-object
incongruity (Friedrich & Friederici, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2006).
This was not the case in the present study, however. At 20 months,
there was a strong linear repetition effect for both real words and
pseudowords. At 24 months, on the other hand, most of the
increase in negativity happened between the first and the third
presentation, with a weaker effect of subsequent repetitions. This
could mean that, with age, the children reached a certain level of
familiarity or recognition of the stimuli in fewer presentations. A
recent study demonstrated that a faster emerging word familiarization effect in infants is associated with better word processing
skills 6 months later, which supports the idea that this is a measure
of word processing maturity (Junge & Cutler, 2014). However, in
the present study there was no effect of vocabulary group on any
of the N200-500 effects, which indicates that children with small
and large productive vocabularies were similarly able to recognize
the words and pseudowords after a first presentation. Previous
studies have shown a link between a stronger word familiarization
effect and language skills, but these studies have involved younger
infants, below 12 months (e.g. Junge et al., 2012; Kooijman et al.,
2013). It is possible that individual differences in this component
decrease with age, resulting in the word familiarity effect in older
infants being less associated with vocabulary skills.
A parietal negativity with a peak around 600 ms, characteristic
of the N400 component, was also modulated by repetition. For real
words, the negative amplitude of this component was attenuated
with repetition independent of vocabulary size, and the linear repetition effect was stronger (had considerably larger effect size) at
20 months than at 24 months. At 24 months, the difference
between the first and subsequent word presentations was smaller,
suggesting that the words were comprehended and processed
fairly easily already at the first presentation. This is reasonable
given the picture-word priming paradigm, where pictures of
known objects functioned as primes for the upcoming words.
Presumably, the older children had stronger semantic representations of the real words used in the experiment, and therefore even
the first presentation of the object functioned well as a prime for
the word. This also indicates that the real word condition involved
a greater amount of learning at 20 months, where each presentation served to further strengthen the association between the
object and the word.

K. Borgstrom et al. / Brain & Language 149 (2015) 33-45

At both ages, the modulation of the N400 component in
response to repetition of pseudowords differed depending on the
children's vocabulary size, shown by a direct correlation between
N400 attenuation and vocabulary size. While children with larger
vocabularies displayed a clear linear reduction in N400 amplitude
to pseudowords (the same pattern as for real words), children
with smaller vocabularies displayed an initial increase in
negativity over primarily right parietal electrodes up to the third
presentation, and then a subsequent decrease in negativity.
Statistically, in the high vocabulary group already the second
presentation of the pseudowords elicited a lower N400 amplitude
than the first presentation, while in children with low vocabularies
the effect of repetition on the N400 did not appear until the fourth
presentation at the earliest. This suggests that children with large
vocabularies reached a certain level of encoding of the pseudowords, or mapping between the novel object and pseudoword,
in fewer trials than those with smaller vocabularies. Assuming
the standard interpretation of the N400 amplitude where larger
amplitude reflects greater effort in semantic processing/access
(e.g. Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Lau et al., 2008), then children with
larger vocabularies reached a level of less effortful processing in
fewer trials than children with smaller vocabularies. This parallels
recent findings on the N200-500 component in 10-month-olds
showing that infants displaying more mature word familiarity
effects reached a level of word recognition in fewer trials than
infants with less mature responses (Junge & Cutler, 2014). The present study's results indicate that in this sample of older children,
similar differences in modulation of the N400 component are
related to language skills. Despite this association between vocabulary size and N400 modulation, we cannot draw any conclusions
regarding the causal relationship. As with all correlational results,
it may be that a quicker N400 attenuation facilitates word learning
and therefore leads to larger vocabularies, or a larger vocabulary
could itself lead to improved word processing skills, including
semantic processing, which would be expressed by the N400 attenuation. Moreover, the N400 attenuation may be an indication of
general brain maturation which could also facilitate vocabulary
growth.
This effect of vocabulary size on ERP modulation during novel
object-pseudoword learning is in line with the results from
Torkildsen et al.'s (2009) study. However, in that study the patterns
and topographies of the repetition effects were different. Children
with low vocabularies showed a pattern of continuously increasing
negativity due to repetition starting from 200 ms after word presentation, while the high vocabulary group showed an initial
increase in negativity followed by a decreased negativity after
the third presentation. This pattern was mainly seen over frontal
and central electrodes and was interpreted as an Nc component
indicating a decrease in attention in the high vocabulary group following a certain level of encoding. What these two data sets have
in common is that children with smaller vocabularies did not display an attenuation of negative amplitude to the same extent as
those with larger vocabularies. The differences in topography
between the two studies can likely be found in the different
choices of reference. In the present study, it was possible to choose
an average reference due to the large number of electrodes. This
may have enabled the clear effects over parietal regions, a region
where Torkildsen et al. (2009) did not find significant effects of
repetition. Whether the N400-like effect in the present study is
analogous to the component interpreted as an Nc in Torkildsen
et al. (2009), or whether these studies have captured functionally
different processes, is difficult to determine. However, since the
effect of repetition began around 400 ms over parietal channels
(but earlier on frontal channels), and the negative component that
peaked around 600 ms resembled the component elicited by
incongruity in the switch phase, it seems reasonable to interpret

43

our results as a modulation of the N400 component during
learning.
The correlation between the N200-500 component and the
N400 component during familiarization of novel words indicates
that the two components are present within the same individuals.
Children who had a larger word familiarization effect were more
likely to show a larger attenuation of the N400 due to repetition.
Such a relation between these two components has not been
reported previously, and suggests that a more efficient processing
of the word form is associated with facilitated semantic processing.
In the younger age group, this association was only relevant for
pseudowords, while in the older group the two components were
related during both novel and familiar word processing.
An interesting aspect of our results is that vocabulary size was
related only to modulation of the N400 to pseudowords, not to real
words, and not to modulations of the frontal N200-500 component.
Thus, the link between the two components is only partial. This
suggests that toddlers with different vocabulary sizes processed
and recognized the actual lexical item similarly, but differed more
in semantic processing (pseudoword-object pairing). In this paradigm the effect of mere repetition of the words and pseudowords
cannot be separated from the priming effect of the picture on the
word/pseudoword. Thus, the modulation of ERPs during familiarization will likely depend both on stimulus repetition, i.e.
decreased novelty of the stimuli, and on a build-up of the association between the picture and word/pseudoword which enables the
picture to function as a prime. However, our knowledge about the
N400 component as an index of semantic processing supports the
interpretation that the children with larger vocabularies were
more efficient at encoding a novel word as a label for a novel
object, although the children in this sample with smaller vocabularies were equally efficient at encoding the actual word form (as
indexed by the N200-500 effect). A retrospective study of
19-month-olds who would later show poor expressive language
and a study of 20-month-olds at-risk for dyslexia both found temporally extended N200-500 effects in these risk-groups (Friedrich
& Friederici, 2006; Torkildsen et al., 2007a). However, our low
vocabulary group did not show such a pattern. This is probably
because the children in our study were only classified according
to their current vocabulary, and most of the children in the low
vocabulary group were not at-risk in terms of their current vocabulary. They were not late talkers, but rather at the lower end of the
normal range. The fact that the N400 modulation to real words was
independent of vocabulary size also underscores that it is the formation of rapid associations between words and referents that differs between high and low producers, and not the processing of
items that have a more consolidated status in long-term memory.

4.3. General discussion and conclusions
The longitudinal design of this study have allowed us to demonstrate a remarkable development of fast mapping ability between
20 and 24 months, measured electrophysiologically in a fairly large
sample of children. During this four-month period the children on
average tripled their productive vocabulary size, an increase
which was coupled with changes in the N400 effect to
pseudoword-referent associations. Moreover, we have shown that
differences in productive vocabulary size are related to differences
in the dynamics of semantic processing during novel word learning, where children with larger vocabularies seem to reach a level
of less effortful semantic processing of novel words after fewer
exposures. Our data also demonstrates that, in toddlers with large
vocabularies, the N400 component responds to word and pseudoword repetition in a similar way as in adults, with a linear attenuation of negativity.

The clear N400 repetition effect found in this study is quite new
in the infant word learning literature. The general pattern of
decreasing parietal negativity with repetition, with the exception
of the response to pseudowords in the low vocabulary group, is
in line with adult research on the N400 component showing attenuation of amplitude due to repetition of both real words and pseudowords. Although children with larger vocabularies showed
evidence of more efficient semantic processing of the pseudowords
during learning, at both 20 and 24 months, this difference was not
directly predictive of successful fast mapping between words and
pictures in terms of an N400 incongruity effect. This most likely
has to do with the specific learning load in the experiment which
may have been too heavy even for the high producers, and thus
the task did not differentiate well between the two groups.
Perhaps if the experiment had included more learning trials, or
had a slower pace, the high producers at 20 months would have
responded to the switched pairings of the pseudowords.
