In this study we explored the temporal origin of processing differences between first and second language production. Forty highly proficient bilinguals named objects of high and low lexical frequency
aloud for both L1 and L2 separately while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The first
electrophysiological differences elicited by response language occurred at the same early P2 peak (140-
220 ms) where we observed the onset of the lexical frequency effect, but only for those bilinguals who
started naming in an L1 context and afterwards switched to an L2 naming context. The bilinguals who
named objects in the reverse direction did not display a language effect in the ERPs. Taken together,
the data show that the L2 naming disadvantage originates during the onset of lexical access and seems
to be driven by both representational strength, which is lower for L2 words, and language control
demands, which are higher for L2 words.

1. Introduction
Speaking in a second language (L2) is more effortful compared
to first language (L1) production as revealed by slower naming
latencies, higher error-rates and more frequent tip-of-the-tongue
states (e.g., Gollan, Montoya, Cera, & Sandoval, 2008; Gollan & Silverberg, 2001; Ivanova & Costa, 2008; Kohnert, Hernandez, &
Bates, 1998; Sadat, Clara, Alario, & Costa, 2012). While this phenomenon in itself is not surprising, understanding the origin and
cause behind the L2 disadvantages has led to quite some debate
in the literature (for a review see Runnqvist, Strijkers, Sadat, &
Costa, 2011). The goal of the current study was to explore the temporal dynamics of L1 versus L2 object naming with event-related
potentials (ERPs) in order to shed light on the time course of processing differences between a bilingual's two languages.
There is disagreement in the field whether the L2 naming disadvantage first occurs at the moment the words associated with a given concept are retrieved (e.g., Runnqvist et al., 2011; Strijkers,
Costa, & Thierry, 2010) or at a later post-lexical level where the selected words are spelled out into sounds and syllables (e.g., Hanulova, Davidson, & Indefrey, 2011; Indefrey, 2006). Evidence cited in
favor of the latter stems mainly from two sources: (a) When comparing haemodynamic data between L1 and L2 production, the left

inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) is the brain region which most reliably
shows a language effect across studies (i.e., stronger activated during L2 production; e.g., Indefrey, 2006), and certain models of single word production link the LIFG to post-lexical processing
(Indefrey & Levelt, 2004); (b) Consistent with the above, a few
ERP studies comparing L1 and L2 production operations report that
language differences do not seem to take effect until after the time
window of lexical selection (e.g., Christoffels, Firk, & Schiller, 2007;
Guo & Peng, 2007; Hanulova, Davidson, & Indefrey, 2008). For instance, in a go/no-go button-press task Hanulova and collaborators
(2008; see also Hanulova et al., 2011) made unbalanced bilinguals
decide upon conceptual (manmade or not) and phonemic information (does the picture name start with a /t/) of an object in L1 or L2.
The authors observed a similar delay (86 ms) for L1 and L2 at the
N200 no-go ERP between the conceptual and phonological conditions, leading to the conclusion that up to phonological retrieval
there are no differences in lexical access between a bilingual's
two languages.
However, when employing such covert decision making paradigms the sensitivity to actual speech behavior can be questioned
on several grounds (see Strijkers & Costa, 2011). And more in general, the spatial and temporal estimates defined by Indefrey and
Levelt (2004), on which most inferences for a post-lexical locus
of the language effect depend, do not go uncontested (e.g., Runnqvist et al., 2011; Strijkers & Costa, 2011). In fact, a recent ERP study
employing a simpler experimental setup (picture naming) and
which was directly linked to the behavior of interest (overt speech)
found that L1 and L2 waveforms already started to diverge around

190 ms after picture onset (Strijkers et al., 2010), with a time
course and morphology similar to that elicited by a range of lexical
sensitive variables (e.g., Costa, Strijkers, Martin, & Thierry, 2009;
Strijkers, Holcomb, & Costa, 2011; Strijkers et al., 2010). To our
knowledge this is the only study available that demonstrates early
differences between L1 and L2 naming within monolingual speaking contexts. A downside, however, was that the language comparisons were done between subjects, leaving open the possibility that
the early deflections reported reflect different brains rather than
different languages. Given the potential impact an early language
effect may have on our understanding of the cognitive and neurophysiological differences underlying bilingual speech production,
the present study sought to explore the findings of Strijkers et al.
(2010) in more detail. Crucially, we wanted to do so in a design
in which the same bilinguals speaking in L1 and L2 could be compared. To this end, early and highly proficient Spanish-Catalan bilinguals were instructed to name objects first in one of their
languages and afterwards in a separate naming block in the other
language. If, with such design, we would again observe an early
ERP effect mimicking that of a lexically sensitive manipulation,
namely word frequency, then the results would provide strong evidence for earlier temporal differences between first and second
language processing than previously thought.

2. Results
2.1. Behavioural results
We found a main effect of Language (F(1, 38) = 16.11, P < .01),
with faster naming latencies in L1 compared to L2; a main effect
of Frequency (F(1, 38) = 59.70, P < .01), with faster naming latencies for low versus high frequency items; and a significant interaction between Language and Frequency (F(1, 38) = 4.85, P = .03),
with larger frequency effects for L2 (62 ms) than L1 (36 ms) (see
Fig. 1). The effect of Language Order and the interactions with this
variable were not significant (all Ps > .10).

2.2.1. 140-220 ms
In this time window low frequency object names elicited more
positive ERP amplitudes compared to high frequency object names
at posterior electrode sites (Table 1; Fig. 2a). Independent t-tests
revealed this effect was significant for Rpar (P = .01; q = .09) and
Cpar (P = .04; q = .13). Also in this time window we found that object naming in L2 elicited more positive ERP amplitudes compared
to L1 naming, but only for the participants who initiated picture
naming in L1 and afterwards changed to L2 (Table 1; Fig. 2b and
c). The participants who started naming in L2 did not display ERP
differences between the two languages (Table 1; Fig. 2b and c). Further examination of this interaction highlighted that while the
ERPs between L1 and L2 were significantly different for LFr
(P < .01; q = .02), FC (P < .01; q = .02), LC (P = .01; q = .02), Cpar
(P = .03; q = .04) sites in those bilinguals naming in the L1 ? L2
direction, the bilinguals performing the task in the L2 ? L1 direction did not show a language effect in the ERPs for any of the clusters tested (all Ps > .10) (see Fig. 2c).

2.2.2. 220-280 ms
Between 220 and 280 ms after stimulus onset ERPs elicited by
low frequency items were more negative going compared to those
elicited by high frequency items at the Lfr cluster (P = .02; q = .09).
For the language effect similar results were observed as in the previous time window (Table 1; Fig. 2b and c). ERPs elicited by L2
naming had significantly more positive amplitudes compared to
those elicited by L1 naming at Lfr (P < .01; q < .01), FC (P < .01;
q < .01), Rfr (P < .01; q < .01), LC (P = .02; q = .02), RC (P = .02;
q = .02) and Cpar (P = .03; q = .03) electrode clusters when performing the naming task in the L1 ? L2 direction, but no significant effects were observed for the reverse language direction between
naming blocks (all Ps > .14) (Fig. 2c).

2.2.3. 280-350 ms
2.2. ERP results
A complete overview of the results from the 2 (Lexical Frequency)  2 (Response Language)  9 (Electrode Cluster)  2 (Language Order) repeated measures ANOVAs on all time windows can
be found in Table 1. Below we will focus on those significant effects
relevant to the questions addressed in the study.

In this final time window ERPs were again more negative going
for low versus high frequency object names at the Lfr electrode
cluster (P = .03; q = .05) and more positive going for low versus
high frequency object names at Lpar (P < .01; q < .01), Cpar
(P = .04; q = .06), Rpar (P < .01; q < .01) and Oc sites (P < .01;
q < .01) (Table 1; Fig. 2a). The ERP results for the language effect
again mimicked the results of the previous time windows with
more positive going ERP amplitudes in response to L2 versus L1
naming for those bilinguals who started the task in L1 (P = .03)
and no language effect for those bilinguals who started the task
in L2 (P > .57) (Table 1; Fig. 2c).

2.3. Onset latency analyses

Fig. 1. Naming latencies (in ms) of the lexical frequency and language effects split
up by language order. L1 represents the first language (Spanish), L2 the second
language (Catalan), LF stands for low frequency items and HF for high frequency
items.

Running t-tests on individual electrodes (e.g., Strijkers et al.,
2010) showed that low and high frequency ERPs started diverging
reliably and significantly from each other by 148 ms after picture
onset at PO2, Pz, PO1, CP2, P4, CP1 and P3, and by 156 ms at O1
and O2. L1 versus L2 ERPs in the L1 ? L2 naming direction started
to diverge significantly and reliably from each other by 124 ms at
FC1, C3, Cz, CP5 and CP2, by 140 ms at F3, FC5, C4 and Pz, and by
200 ms at Fz, FC2, CP1 and P3. In contrast, for the L2 ? L1 naming
direction none of the electrodes displayed a consecutive series of
minimum 12 significant t-tests for the contrast between L1 and
L2 naming.

3. General discussion
In this study we traced the time course of L1 versus L2 object
naming with ERPs in order to gain insights about the temporal dissociation between a bilingual's two languages. For the naming
latencies the expected L2 naming disadvantage (i.e., slower
responses for L2 than L1) and the frequency effect (i.e., slower responses for low than high frequency names) were significant. Furthermore, the word frequency effect was larger for naming in L2
compared to naming in L1 (e.g., Gollan et al., 2008; but see Ivanova
& Costa, 2008). In the ERPs both phenomena first became apparent
in the same early time window: Between 140 and 220 ms ERPs
elicited by low frequency items and L2 naming were more positive
compared to those elicited by high frequency items and L1 naming,
replicating the P2-like modulations previously reported for both
variables (Strijkers et al., 2010). Moreover, the ERP modulations
of response language were restricted to those bilinguals who
started naming in L1 and afterwards named in L2, but were absent
for those who first named objects in L2 and later in L1. Taken together, the results show that cortical differences between first
and second language production already occur in a time window
corresponding to the onset of lexical access (e.g., Costa et al.,
2009; Strijkers et al., 2010), though the presence of this language
effect depended on the language order in which the bilinguals
named objects. The latter suggests that the naming disadvantage
in L2 is generated by a dynamic where the lower representational
strength of L2 words invokes a stronger reliance on language control compared to the retrieval of L1 words for speech.
While neurophysiological data from studies contrasting first
and second language production have been argued to favour a
post-lexical locus for the L2 disadvantage (e.g., Hanulova et al.,
2011; Indefrey, 2006), the current data emphasize that such a view
is incomplete. Just as reported by Strijkers et al. (2010), response
language modulated the P2 peak, suggesting a lexical origin of
the L2 naming disadvantage. A first indicator which allows for this
conclusion is the early onset of the effect (120-140 ms). Even if
one adopts Indefrey and Levelt's temporal model (2004), hereby
following the same line of reasoning employed to assign a postlexical origin to the L2 naming disadvantage, the current ERP
deflections elicited by response language are too early to reflect
syllabification. A second and better indicator (since it does not rely
on a hypothetical model) relates to the ERP morphology. The modulations elicited by response language and lexical frequency resulted in early overlapping time courses (within 150 ms) and
similar positive enhancements for the less accessible representations (low frequency words and L2 words). Analogous P2 deflections in object naming have previously been reported for a range
of psycholinguistic variables such as lexical frequency (e.g.,

Strijkers et al., 2010; 2011; present data), cognate-status (e.g., Strijkers et al., 2010), response language (e.g., Strijkers et al., 2010;
present data) and cumulative semantic interference (e.g., Costa
et al., 2009). Although each of these variables individually might
be attributed to a processing stage other than lexical selection,
combining them leaves little room for an interpretation different
than that the (centro-parietal) P2 modulation in object naming is
sensitive to the onset of lexical activation (see Strijkers & Costa,
2011).
Of course, demonstrating that the L2 disadvantage originates
when the bilingual brain engages in lexical access does not preclude that it could affect other levels of linguistic information such
as phonology as well (e.g., Hoshino & Thierry, 2011). Also the current ERP divergences between L1 and L2 naming remained significant later in time (see also Strijkers et al., 2010). This might
indicate that language has a ubiquitous effect within the linguistic
system, similarly to what has been argued to occur for lexical frequency (e.g., Graves, Grabowski, Mehta, & Gordon, 2007; Knobel,
Finkbeiner, & Caramazza, 2008; Strijkers et al., 2010). Because a
bilingual's L2 is less practiced, all representational knowledge
linked to L2 words will not be as strongly consolidated in the brain
as the knowledge linked to L1 words (e.g., less myelinisation for
less activated neuronal populations; e.g., Hauk & Pulvermuller,
2004), which will require additional activation and processing time
for the neural populations representing L2 words to fully ignite.
The latter does not necessarily mean that the lexical frequency effect and the L2 disadvantage are therefore identical at the cortical
level. In fact, certain differences between the effects can be appreciated as well. While the frequency effect has a posterior scalp distribution, the language effect is more broadly distributed with its
maximum over central electrodes. Also, for the later time windows
(220-280 ms; 280-350 ms), the posterior frequency effect was
accompanied by a (left) anterior frequency effect displaying more
negative going ERPs for low compared to high frequency words,
which possibly reflects the image-specific N300 linked to non-verbal semantics (e.g., Holcomb & McPherson, 1994) and/or the typical N400 when elicited by pictures (e.g., Kutas & Federmeier, 2011).
In contrast, a similar anterior ERP modulation was not present for
the language effect. Speculating about reasons for these differences
is not straightforward, though not observing any distinctions
would have been more surprising given that the frequency effect
is based on a comparison between different items while the language effect involves comparing the same items (across participants). In that sense, perhaps the resemblances in electrical brain
response for both phenomena are more revealing than the differences. Nevertheless, whether or not the language effect can be perceived as a frequency effect in disguise, of importance here is the
temporal rationale. If the ERP time course of the lexical frequency

by object naming in L1 (red solid line) versus L2 (red dotted line) are plotted for those participants naming first in L2 and then in L1 (L2 ? L1). The first ERP differences

effect in this time window for each group are displayed in the figure.

effect is a good index for the onset of lexical access in object naming, than the overlapping temporal pattern observed for the language effect demonstrates that processing differences between a
bilingual's two language emerge as soon as entering the linguistic
system.
This main contribution of the study has to be complemented in
one important way: The presence of the L2 disadvantage in the

ERPs critically depended on naming directionality. While the P2
modulation was evident when speaking in L1 and afterwards
switching to L2 naming, the effect disappeared when switching
from an L2 to an L1 naming context. Interestingly, a recent ERP
study exploring long term translation priming reports a similar
interaction between response language and directionality. Naming
objects in L1 and subsequently naming their translations in L2

10

resulted in a repetition benefit, while for L1 following L2 naming
no such repetition benefit was observed and instead L1 elicited
more negative ERP amplitudes compared to L2 (Misra, Guo, Bobb,
& Kroll, 2012). This finding was interpreted as revealing a decrease
in the accessibility of L1 representations after L2 speech due to the
stronger involvement of language control during L2 naming (see
also Guo, Liu, Misra, & Kroll, 2011; Van Assche, Duyck, & Gollan,
2013). Finding a similar moderating influence of language directionality in the current study is interesting since it sheds some
light on the mechanism behind the L2 naming disadvantage. That
is, processing differences between L1 and L2 naming are not solely
reflected in an activation imbalance between the more frequently
used L1 versus L2 words (e.g., Gollan et al., 2008; Gollan et al.,
2011), but this frequency-lag seems to interact with bilingual language control (e.g., Green, 1998; Kroll, Bobb, Misra, & Guo, 2008).
Because L2 representations are of a lower frequency than L1 representations, fluent and error-free speech requires a stronger reliance
on language control in the weaker L2 compared to the dominant L1
which will result in a more costly processing (e.g., Abutalebi &
Green, 2007; Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2008). In that manner, the
findings might reveal stronger reactive inhibition of L1 representations during L2 naming than vice versa (global and bilingual-specific: e.g., Abutalebi et al., 2008; Christoffels et al., 2007; Green,
1998; Kroll et al., 2008; Misra et al., 2012; or local and speakergeneral: e.g., Runnqvist, Strijkers, Alario, & Costa, 2012; Runnqvist
et al., 2011), which explains the absence of a language effect in the
ERPs for the L2 ? L1 direction. Because of the L1 inhibition during
L2 naming, L1 representations will be less accessible on subsequent L1 naming compared to the L1 ? L2 order, hereby masking
out the early language effect observed for the latter. Another (not
mutually exclusive) possibility, which fits with the P2 modulation
encountered (e.g., Strijkers et al., 2011), relates to proactive control
being sensitive to language (e.g., Runnqvist et al., 2011). Given that
participants know beforehand in which language to respond, such
knowledge could enhance accessibility to language-relevant representations in a top-down fashion. Within such framework, the
weaker representations will require stronger proactive facilitation,
arguably engendered by the P2 increase for L2 naming in the
L1 ? L2 direction (see Strijkers et al., 2011). In contrast, when initiating the task in L2, the strong proactive enhancement could
cause a higher degree of cross-language competition on subsequent L1 naming. If so, an increase in proactive control for accessing L1 words will be required, resulting in the absence of a P2
language effect. Exploring these possibilities explicitly in future research will be important in order to understand how bilinguals
control their utterances in monolingual speech contexts.
For present purposes, the results in this study revealed that the
temporal dynamics between L1 and L2 naming start to dissociate
the moment the brain engages in lexical processing and are engendered by an increase in cortical activation during L2 speech, but
only when switching from an L1 to an L2 naming context. This is
likely because words in a bilingual's weaker language are less
accessible and require a stronger recruitment of language control
compared to words in the dominant language.

4. Methods
4.1. Participants
40 early and highly proficient Spanish-Catalan bilinguals (25 females) participated in the study (mean age = 22; S.D = 3). All were
psychology students at the University of Barcelona, right-handed,
with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and without any neurological or motor-related deficits. Before the experiment, participants were asked to indicate in a scale from 1 (low proficient) to

5 (native like level) their level of proficiency both in Spanish (L1:
5) and in Catalan (L2: 4.8).
4.2. Materials
64. line-drawings were selected, half with high and the other
half with low frequency names (mean lemma frequency (LEXESP;
Sebastian-Galles, Marti, Carreiras, & Cuetos, 2000): low frequency:
3.9; high frequency: 52). All items were matched for word length,
cognate-status, imageability, typicality and physical variance (e.g.,
Thierry, Martin, Downing, & Pegna, 2007). The 64 items were divided in two separate sets of 32 items. These two sets were carefully controlled to have the same lexical frequency differences
within each set and identical frequency values between sets. In
that manner, we ended up with 2 fully counterbalanced sets of
items to ensure that a given participants did not have to name
translations. Participants named a first set of items in one language
(L1 or L2) and another set of different items in a subsequent block
in the other language (L2 or L1). In total 20 participants named the
pictures in the L1 ? L2 direction and the other 20 participants in
the L2 ? L1 direction. Within eachblock items were repeated three
times to ensure sufficient statistical power.
4.3. Procedure
Each experimental trial had the following structure: (a) a picture was displayed at the centre of the screen until a response
was given or for a maximum of 1500 ms; (b) a blank inter-trial
interval of 1000 ms intervened between picture offset and the onset of a new trial. Response times were measured by a voice key.
4.4. EEG procedure
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was continuously recorded
from 31 scalp locations using tin electrodes embedded in an elastic
cap. Two bipolar electrodes were placed next to and beneath the
left eye (EOGH and EOGV) to register eye movements; two other
electrodes were placed on the participants' right and left mastoid
(A1 and A2) for off-line referencing and a final electrode was
placed on the participants' nose as on-line reference channel. The
EEG was continuously recorded and digitized at 250 Hz. Impedances were reduced to 5 kOhms or less prior to the beginning of
recording. Before segmentation, the EEG was processed through a
low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 20 Hz and a high-pass
filter of 0.03 Hz. The raw EEG was segmented off-line in epochs
of 650 ms starting 200 ms before stimulus onset until 450 ms after
stimulus onset. Prior to averaging, artefact and eye-movement
rejection criteria were applied and the data were baseline corrected using the 200 ms pre-stimulus interval. Furthermore, the
same motor artefact rejection procedure as in Strijkers et al.
(2010) was applied to ensure that articulation distortions of the
ERPs were removed from the data.
4.5. Analyses
Both for naming latencies and ERPs 2 (Lexical Frequency)  2
(Response Language)  9 (Electrode Cluster - only for ERPs)  2
(Language Order - between-subjects factor) repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted. For the ERPs, the ANOVAs were conducted
on 5 different time-windows centred on peaks visible in the global
field power averaged over subjects and conditions (0-60 ms;
60-120 ms; 140-220 ms; 220-280 ms; 280-350 ms), and over 9
electrode clusters (average over the individual electrodes): Leftfrontal (LFr), right-frontal (RFr), left-central (LC), fronto-central
(FC), right-central (RC), left-parietal (Lpar), centro-parietal (Cpar),
right-parietal (Rpar) and occipital (Oc). Where relevant and to help

understand significant interactions with electrode cluster, the results from independent two-tailed t-tests will be reported (significant p-values and FDR corrected q-values; Benjamini & Hochberg,
2000).
