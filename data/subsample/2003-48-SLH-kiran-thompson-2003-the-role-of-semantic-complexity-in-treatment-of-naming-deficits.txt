The effect of typicality of category exemplars on naming was investigated using a
single subject experimental design across participants and behaviors in 4 patients
with fluent aphasia. Participants received a semantic feature treatment to improve
naming of either typical or atypical items within semantic categories, while
generalization was tested to untrained items of the category. The order of
typicality and category trained was counterbalanced across participants. Results
indicated that patients trained on naming of atypical exemplars demonstrated
generalization to naming of intermediate and typical items. However, patients
trained on typical items demonstrated no generalized naming effect to intermediate or atypical examples. Furthermore, analysis of errors indicated an evolution
of errors throughout training, from those with no apparent relationship to the
target to primarily semantic and phonemic paraphasias. Performance on
standardized language tests also showed changes as a function of treatment.
Theoretical and clinical implications regarding the impact of considering semantic
complexity on rehabilitation of naming deficits in aphasia are discussed.

aming deficits are the most common form of language
impairment among individuals with aphasia and have been
reported across aphasia classification categories, although the
nature of naming errors occurring in persons with different types of
aphasia may vary (Butterworth, Howard, & McLaughlin, 1984;
Goodglass, 1980, 1998). Typically, patients with fluent (Wernicke's) aphasia produce primarily unrelated or jargon words (neologisms), semantically or phonologically related errors, or are not able to retrieve the word
at all (Ellis, Miller, & Sin, 1983; Hillis & Caramazza, 1995). Patients
with fluent aphasia also often present with concomitant semantic deficits, including impairments in category knowledge (see Shelton &
Caramazza, 1999, for a review) leading to the hypothesis that naming
deficits in fluent aphasia may derive from impairments within the semantic system.
The source of naming deficits in fluent aphasia, however, is not altogether clear. According to interactive activation models of naming (Dell,
1986; Dell, Schwartz, Martin, Saffran, & Gagnon, 1997; Stemberger,

1985), the type of errors seen in fluent aphasia can arise
from incomplete/incorrect activation of semantic nodes
or phonological nodes during naming attempts or a failure in the bidirectional link between them. Such failure
can result in no discernable overlap between the produced word and the intended word, as in neologistic errors. Semantic and phonological errors result from activation of competing entries in the lexicon, which share
features with the target, or the correct target may receive interference from other activated words.
Numerous researchers have examined recovery of
naming in patients with aphasia when provided with
treatment (Howard, Patterson, Franklin, Orchid-Lisle,
& Morton 1985a, 1985b; Marshall, Pound, WhiteThomson, & Pring, 1990; Nickels & Best, 1996), although
few have focused on patients with fluent aphasia. Several studies have used semantically based treatment by
means of auditory and written word to picture matching tasks, answering yes/no questions about the target,
spoken word categorization, and relatedness judgment
tasks (Boyle & Coehlo, 1995; Davis & Pring, 1991;
Howard et al., 1985a). Other studies have compared the
effects of semantic and phonological treatment on naming and, in general, have found that a combination of
both treatments is most effective (Le Dorze, Boulay,
Gaudreau, & Brassard, 1994; Howard et al., 1985b).
Although most of these studies have reported improvement of trained items, few have found generalization to
untrained items (Davis & Pring, 1991; Marshall et al.,
1990; Pring, Hamilton, Harwood, & McBride, 1993), and
still fewer have examined changes in error patterns resulting from treatment. That many of these studies are
aimed at improving semantic access but do not emphasize the underlying aspects of lexical-semantic processing may be a possible reason for the limited generalization noted. Furthermore, the language material chosen
to assess generalization has not always been related to
the trained examples on important linguistic dimensions, thereby failing an important requirement for generalization (Thompson, 1988). Treatments based on
models of lexical processing, which, for example, focus
on the semantic features of items within a particular
superordinate category (Drew & Thompson, 1999) or
attempt to facilitate spreading activation of semantically
related words (Boyle & Coehlo, 1995), have been more
successful at facilitating generalization.
Generalization also may be enhanced by considering
the hierarchical complexity of the stimuli selected for treatment. The complexity effect, that is, training items that
are more complex to facilitate generalization to untrained
simpler items now has robust evidence from treatment
studies for agrammatic aphasia as well as for children
with phonological deficits. As shown by Thompson and
colleagues in several studies (e.g., Thompson et al., 1997;
Thompson, Ballard, & Shapiro, 1998), training complex

syntactic structures (e.g., object-cleft sentences) results
in generalization to simpler structures (e.g., wh- questions)
that are in a subset relation to trained structures in
agrammatic aphasic patients. This observation led to the
complexity account of treatment efficacy (CATE; Thompson, Shapiro, Kiran, & Sobecks, 2003). Likewise, Geirut
and colleagues (for a review, see Geirut, 2001) have demonstrated that phonological treatment focused on complex sounds (either in terms of consistency, age of acquisition, or paired contrasts) results in greater generalization
to untrained sounds in children with phonological deficits. Moving beyond language, there is supportive evidence
of complexity in motor skill learning by adults, particularly as it relates to the conditions of practice in sports
such as golf or tennis (Schmidt & Lee, 1999). The findings
in this area demonstrate that practice of more difficult
skills or levels of a skill results in greater learning of simpler motor skills.
In the present experiment, we apply the notion of
complexity to semantic concepts with reference to naming deficits in patients with aphasia. Because existing
naming treatment studies have not been completely
successful in promoting generalization, the aim of the
present experiment was to examine semantic complexity by controlling the typicality of category exemplars,
with the postulate that training atypical (more complex)
items would facilitate greater generalization to untrained items than training typical (less complex) category exemplars. The basis for such a hypothesis stems
from Rosch's (1975) seminal work showing that typical
examples (e.g., robin) have a different status within semantic categories (e.g., bird) than atypical examples
(e.g., ostrich). Since then, there has been extensive experimental evidence supporting preferential processing
(i.e., faster reaction times) for typical, as compared to
atypical items (the typicality effect; Hampton, 1993,
1995; Kiran & Thompson, 2003; Larochelle & Pineu,
1994; Rosch & Mervis, 1975; Smith, Shoben, & Rips,
1974; Storms, De Boek, & Ruts, 2000).
Moreover, Plaut (1996) has investigated differential
processing of atypical and typical examples in a computer
simulated network. The network was trained to recognize a set of artificial typical and atypical words, where
typical words shared more of the semantic features of the
category prototype (encoded as a set of binary values) than
did atypical words. Once training was complete, the network was lesioned and retrained on either the typical items
or the atypical ones. Plaut found that retraining atypical
items resulted in improvements in recognition of typical
items as well. However, training typical items improved
performance only on trained items, whereas performance
on atypical words deteriorated.
Plaut's (1996) findings, although not tested in humans, are particularly relevant to treatment of Wernicke's

aphasia, in that patients with Wernicke's aphasia do not
show a typicality effect, as do normals and patients with
Broca's aphasia (Grober, Perecman, Kellar, & Brown, 1980;
Grossman 1981; Kiran & Thompson, 2003). That is,
Wernicke's patients do not show a difference in reaction
times between typical and atypical examples on category
verification tasks. We, therefore, extend Plaut's complexity model to individuals with fluent aphasia. Using a semantically based treatment, we emphasized the featural
detail of typical versus atypical items in an attempt to
facilitate improved naming in patients with fluent aphasia. The treatment provided was motivated by prototype/
family resemblance models of typicality (Hampton, 1993,
1995; Rosch & Mervis, 1975; for a review of models of
typicality, see Komatsu, 1992). According to these models, categories are represented by a set of features that
are more or less salient for defining the category prototype. The more similar a particular item in a category is
to the prototype, the more typical it is judged to be. The
less similar it is to the prototype, the less typical the item
and, therefore, fewer other examples in the category share
its features. A multidimensional scaling of similarity judgments in a category (Rosch & Mervis, 1975) would place
typical examples in the center of semantic space and atypical examples at its periphery.
For the purpose of the present experiment, it was
hypothesized that if indeed atypical examples are at the
periphery of semantic categories, then training features
associated with them would emphasize the variation of
features within the category (e.g., ostrich: runs, long legs;
penguin: swims, eats fish), as well as features of the prototype (e.g., lays eggs, has beak). Thus, features associated with the typical examples would be strengthened
by atypical item training, and hence, access to typical
items would be improved. Conversely, training semantic
features of typical examples was not expected to result
in generalization to intermediate or atypical items. Theoretically, typical examples entail little variation of semantic features within the category and, thus, training these
examples was predicted to improve only items at the center that share similar features. We, therefore, hypothesized that within a category, atypical exemplars are more
"complex" than typical ones, because collectively these

items convey more diverse information about the category
and its semantic features than typical items.
In the present experiment, we also examined the nature of naming errors occurring throughout treatment.
We predicted that, if successful in improving naming,
treatment would result in an evolution of errors reflective of enhanced access to both semantic and phonological targets during naming attempts. Prior to treatment,
patients would be unable to access any specific information about target items, resulting in predominately neologistic errors, unrelated words, or no responses. Based
on premises of interactive activation models, we predicted
that semantically based treatment would facilitate improved access to semantic and phonological approximations of target words. Following treatment, therefore, we
predicted a greater proportion of semantic and/or phonemic errors. Finally, performance on standardized language
measures which examine aspects of lexical-semantic processing also was expected to improve.

Method
Participants
Four monolingual, English-speaking individuals
with fluent aphasia, with pervasive naming deficits, participated in the study. The participants were selected
from the Northwestern University Speech and Language
Clinic and were recruited from stroke groups in the
greater Chicago area. Several participant selection criteria were met, including (a) a single left hemisphere
stroke in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery
confirmed by a CT/MRI scan, (b) onset of stroke at least
9 months prior to participation in the study, (c) premorbid right-handedness as determined by a self-rating questionnaire, and (d) at least a high school degree
(see Table 1). All participants also passed a pure-tone
hearing screening at 40 db HL bilaterally at 500, 1000,
and 2000 Hz and showed no visual impairment as measured by the Snellen chart. All participants had received
varying amounts of traditional language treatment (with
the exception of Participant 4), which was discontinued
at least 3 months prior to the present study.

The diagnosis of fluent aphasia was determined by
administration of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB;
Kertesz, 1982) and other standardized language measures.
Results showed that all patients presented with fluent
speech (range = 5-8), impaired comprehension (range =
5.8-6.8), and naming deficits (range = 20%-45% accuracy),
and were able to comprehend written single words and
phrases on the Reading Comprehension test of the WAB.
All participants also showed impaired naming of high and
low frequency items on the Boston Naming Test (BNT;
Goodglass, Kaplan, & Wientraub, 1983; range = 7%-15%
accuracy; see Table 2.)

In addition to the aphasic participants, 30 normal
young adults (range = 21-40 years) and 30 normal older
adults (range = 41-75 years) participated in the various
stimulus development tasks described below. Older participants were recruited from the Buehler Center on Aging Registry and from Northwestern University, and the
young individuals were students and staff at Northwestern University. All participants had normal or correctedto-normal vision, normal hearing, and at least a high
school degree. Exclusionary criteria included history of
neurological disorders such as stroke, transient ischemic
attacks, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, psychological illnesses, alcoholism, learning disability, seizures, and attention deficit disorders.

Subtests of the Psycholinguistic Assessment of Language Processing in Aphasia (PALPA; Kay, Lesser, &
Coltheart, 1992) also were administered. Results showed
that although some inconsistency was noted across participants on the spoken and written word to picture matching tasks (range = 57%-88%; range = 62%-90%, respectively), all participants demonstrated impairments in
judging auditory and written word pairs (i.e., synonyms;
range = 66%-70%, range = 60%-72%, respectively). Similarly, all participants had difficulties associating semantically related word pairs (high imageable pairs: range =
33%-60%, low imageable pairs: range = 0%-53%, respectively). These data indicated impairments in the semantic system for all participants. Performance on single word
repetition (range = 58%-95%) and single word oral reading (range = 46%-79%) was varied, suggesting some phonological output lexicon impairment as well.

Stimuli
For purposes of the present experiment, norms for
typicality of categories and their examples were developed prior to initiation of treatment, because previously
published norms (Rosch, 1975; Uyeda & Mandler, 1980)
are relevant only for young participants. The following
sections describe the procedures used for stimulus
development.

labels (vegetables, transportation, weapons, tools, clothing, furniture, sports, animals, fruits, birds, occupations,
and musical instruments; Rosch, 1975; Uyeda &
Mandler, 1980) and were asked to write down as many
basic level examples as they could think of for each category. Participants were instructed not to provide synonyms (e.g., rabbit, hare) or descriptive subordinate labels (e.g., furniture: kitchen chair).

transportation, sports, fruits, musical instruments,
weapons, clothing, animals, furniture, and tools. Two
remaining categories (birds, vegetables) were selected
for treatment.

Following completion of this task, responses from both
the young and older participants were pooled, resulting
in at least 50 examples for each category. A list with items
for each superordinate category was then given to a new
group of 20 participants (10 young and 10 older individuals). Two versions of the list were created, with the order
of examples under each category randomized. Each version was given to half of the participants in each age group.
Using instructions developed by Rosch (1975), participants
were asked to rate on a 7-point scale, the extent to which
each example represented their idea or image of the category term (typicality). A rating of 1 corresponded to the
item being a very good example of the category; a rating
of 7 indicated that item was considered a very poor example; a rating of 4 indicated a moderate fit. Participants
were also required to mark U for examples that were unfamiliar to them (Malt & Smith, 1982). Once the participants completed the task, the average rating score, standard deviation, and median value for each example of each
category were calculated across all participants.

Twenty-four items within each category were selected by converting typicality ratings for each item into
z scores. For each category, items with the highest z
scores (N = 8) were selected as typical examples (range
= -1.0 to -.50), and items with the lowest z scores (N =
8) were selected as atypical examples (range = 1.0 to
.07). Items with z scores ranging from -.49 to .01 were
selected as intermediate examples (N = 8). In general,
the 24 examples selected from each category were low
frequency words according to written word frequency
norms (Frances & Kucera, 1982), with one exception
(Chicken = 49). Low frequency examples were selected
to eliminate the possibility of generalization as a function of frequency rather than typicality. Each of the three
sets (typical, atypical, and intermediate) for both categories (birds and vegetables) was matched for written
word frequency and number of syllables (see Appendix
A for a list of treatment items). Corresponding photos of
each item were printed on 4 x 6 in. cards. Additionally,
examples from other superordinate categories (fruits,
animals, and musical instruments) were selected to serve
as distractors during treatment. In summary, there were
two treatment categories with 24 examples each and
three distracter categories with 12 examples each.

Development of Treatment
Categories and Their Examples

Development of Semantic Features
for Treatment

Several criteria were used to select categories and
their examples to be used in treatment. First, categories were eliminated in which (a) more than 40% of the
examples in a category were marked as being unfamiliar (e.g., tools), (b) an unequal distribution was noted
where most examples were considered typical (e.g., clothing), and (c) atypical items overlapped in two categories
(e.g., foot for weapons and transportation).

Thirty features that were either physically (e.g., is
red in color, has feathers), functionally (e.g., is made into
pie, is a predator), characteristically (e.g., is juicy, lays
eggs), or contextually (e.g., found in a grocery store, lives
near water) related to items in each category were selected from published norms (Barr & Caplan, 1987) and
from the Internet. Only features that 18 of 20 young
and elderly participants marked as being features of the
category were selected. Fifteen of these features were
applicable to all items in the category (e.g., birds: lays
eggs, has a beak), and 15 features were relevant to at
least two items, and were used to reinforce features of
both typical and atypical examples (e.g., penguin, swan:
swims, lives near water). Finally, 20 distractor features
belonging to the categories sports, transportation, animals, insects, flowers, and weapons were selected and
were evenly distributed in terms of the attribute types
(e.g., physical, functional, contextual, characteristic).

Several additional criteria were used to eliminate
problematic examples within categories. For instance,
examples that at least 60% (12 of 20) of the participants
marked as unfamiliar (U) were eliminated. Examples
were also excluded if they (a) had a standard deviation
of 2 or more, (b) conveyed the same meaning, (e.g., zeppelin and blimp for transportation), (c) were both atypical and unfamiliar (e.g., persimmon for fruit), (d) were
homophones (e.g., duck), (e) lacked any salient features
(e.g., finch, kale), and (f) were questionable category
members (e.g., seaweed for vegetables). Once specific examples from each category were eliminated, if the number of remaining examples in the category was below
30 the entire category was eliminated. Based on these
criteria, 10 categories were eliminated: occupations,

Design

Connell & Thompson, 1986; McReynolds & Kearns, 1983)
was used to examine acquisition of trained items and generalization to untrained items within and across categories. In addition to varying the number of baseline probes
preceding treatment, the order of categories trained and
typicality of stimulus sets within each category were counterbalanced across participants. Participants 1 and 4 received five baseline probes prior to treatment, whereas
Participants 2 and 3 received three. Although Participants
1 and 2 were trained on birds first, Participants 3 and 4
were trained first on vegetables. Further, for Participants
1 and 3, the eight typical items were treated first, while
the remaining intermediate and atypical items of the category (N = 16) and all 24 items of the untrained category
were tested for generalization. For these 2 participants,
if naming accuracy for the trained typical items achieved
criterion level (7 of 8 naming for two consecutive sessions)
and no improvement was observed in naming of the untrained intermediate or atypical items, treatment was
shifted to the intermediate set. If no generalization to
naming of the atypical group was noted, while the accuracy of the trained intermediate items achieved criterion,
treatment was finally shifted to the eight atypical items.
Once all the items of the set (N = 24) were acquired, treatment was shifted to the typical examples of the second
category and the same procedure followed (however, see
results for Participant 1). The same protocol was followed
for Participants 2 and 4, except in this case all atypical
items were treated first while the remaining intermediate and typical items of the category (N = 16) and all 24
items of the untrained category were probed as in
baseline. For these 2 participants, if naming accuracy for
the trained atypical items achieved criterion level with
no generalization, treatment was shifted to the intermediate subset and, following the same criteria, to the typical subset. For all participants, two true baseline probes
were acquired for the untrained (second) semantic category, prior to its treatment.

Baseline Naming Procedures
Confrontation naming of all 48 items (24 examples
from each category) was tested during baseline. Participants were shown each picture (presented in random order) and were instructed to name the bird or vegetable
depicted. Responses were considered correct if they were
clear and intelligible productions of the target item occurring within 20 s of stimulus presentation. Self-corrected
responses, dialectical differences, and distortion/substitution of one vowel or consonant (e.g., rovin/robin) were
allowed. All other responses including (a) superordinate
labels (e.g., bird/cardinal); (b) circumlocutory responses;
(c) unrelated, out of the category responses (e.g., apple/
lettuce); (d) no responses or "I don't know"; (e) neologisms
(i.e., less than 50% of the word resembling the target, such

as barnett/chicken); (f) semantic paraphasias (e.g., pelican/seagull); and (g) phonemic paraphasias (e.g., bravin/
robin) were counted as incorrect responses. Percent correct named, as well as the percentage of each error type
relative to all errors, was calculated.

Treatment
All participants were treated concurrently, once a
day for 2 hr, two times per week. During each treatment session, participants performed the following steps
for each of the eight examples of the subset: (a) naming
the picture, (b) sorting pictures by category, (c) identifying semantic attributes applicable to the target example
from a set of category features, and (d) answering yes/
no questions pertaining to the semantic features of the
target item. During the category sorting task, the examiner randomized 60 pictures, of which 24 were from
the target category and 12 were from each of three
distractor categories. Once the patient demonstrated
100% accuracy on picture sorting for 10 consecutive
treatment sessions, this step was eliminated for each
target item and was performed once at the beginning of
every treatment session. For specific instructions that
were used in treatment see Appendix B.

Treatment Probes
Throughout treatment, naming probes like those
used in the baseline condition were presented to assess
naming of the trained and untrained items. Naming
probes for all 24 items of the category in training were
administered prior to every second treatment session.
Naming probes for both the trained and untrained category were also conducted at the completion of treatment for each subset (e.g., typical, intermediate, atypical). The order of presentation of items was randomized
during each probe presentation.
Responses to naming probes, coded in the same way
as in baseline, served as the primary dependent measure
in the study. Additionally, evolution of errors and performance on standardized language tests were examined.
Treatment was discontinued when naming accuracy of 7
of 8 items was observed for two consecutive sessions or
when a total of 20 treatment sessions (10 probe sessions)
were completed. Generalized naming to the untrained
examples was considered to have occurred when levels of
performance changed by 40% over baseline levels.

Follow-Up Probes
Naming accuracy for both categories was again assessed between 6 and 10 weeks following completion of
the study. Procedures were identical to those used during baseline testing.

Reliability
All baseline and treatment probe sessions were recorded on audiotape and 30% of the treatment sessions
were recorded on videotape. Reliability on the dependent variable (naming responses) was calculated for 38%
of the probe sessions, resulting in 90%-100% agreement.
Reliability on the independent variable (i.e., presentation of the treatment protocol) was calculated by an independent observer viewing videotaped sessions. Pointto-point agreement ranged from 95%-100%.

Results
Naming Accuracy
Results are presented in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 in
multiple baseline formats showing the number of items
named correctly for each subset (typical, intermediate,

and atypical) within each category. Data are presented
for baseline, treatment, and follow-up phases of the experiment. All participants demonstrated stable baselines (criterion of less than 2 points fluctuation across
sessions), with the exception of Participant 3 who
showed an increase in production of intermediate examples of vegetables.

Participant 1
Following baseline testing, treatment was initiated
on typical items of birds for Participant 1, which resulted
in acquisition of trained items, with training criterion met
within 7 weeks. However, generalization to intermediate
or atypical examples was not observed during this training. Only direct treatment of intermediate items resulted
in their acquisition and, once again, this treatment had
no effect on atypical items. Finally, when treatment was
shifted to atypical examples, improvement was noted on
the trained atypical items (see Figure 1a).

intermediate, and typical items for the category vegetables across baseline, treatment, and follow-up phases for Participant 1.

Administration of naming probes on the untrained
category, vegetables indicated no changes throughout
treatment focused on birds (see Figure 1b). Because this
participant expressed frustration with treatment for the
category birds (which required a total of 25 weeks to
train) the second category (vegetables) was trained by
first targeting atypical, rather than typical items as was
originally planned. This alteration in the design also
allowed for examination of differential responsiveness
to typical or atypical training within the same participant. Results showed that when treatment was extended
to atypical examples of vegetables, immediate improvement was noted and criterion was met in 8 weeks. More
important, concomitant generalized naming of both untrained intermediate and typical items was observed
during atypical exemplar training.

Participant 2
Participant 2 received treatment on atypical exemplars of birds. As can be seen in Figure 2a, this treatment

resulted not only in improved production of trained items
(criterion was reached in 11 weeks), but also generalization to both intermediate and typical items. Notably, no
change in vegetables was noted during this training. However, when treatment was extended to vegetables, the
training effect noted for birds was replicated. That is, treatment initiated on atypical vegetables items resulted in
acquisition of both trained atypical items, and untrained
intermediate and typical vegetable items within 6 weeks
(see Figure 2b).

Participant 3
Participant 3 received treatment focused on typical vegetables items. The observed rising baseline occurring during the first three baseline probes disappeared on subsequent treatment probes of these items,
eliminating any threat to internal validity imposed by
unstable baselines. Like Participant 1, this treatment
resulted in no generalization from typical items to intermediate or atypical items for Participant 3, even

though clear acquisition of trained items was noted. A
similar effect was noted when treatment was shifted to
intermediate examples of vegetables. Once again, an
acquisition curve was noted for intermediate items, with
no effect on atypical item naming. Only when treatment was directly applied to the atypical items was
naming of these items improved (see Figure 3a). Because treatment for vegetables required a total of 28
weeks (approximately 7 months), treatment for the second category was not provided.

Participant 4
For Participant 4, treatment of atypical items resulted in an effect similar to that seen for Participant 2,
who also received treatment focused on atypical items.
For both categories, Participant 4 showed improved naming of trained items, reaching criterion in 6 weeks for
vegetables and 9 for birds, while generalized naming to

untrained intermediate and atypical items was also observed (see Figures 4a and 4b).

Follow-Up Probes
Results of follow-up probes conducted 6 to 10 weeks
following treatment are also illustrated in Figures 1, 2,
and 4. Participant 3 did not receive follow-up probes for
health reasons. In general, on follow-up, participants
demonstrated naming performance higher than initial
baseline levels and near the mean performance of the
last two probes during treatment, indicating maintenance of training effects.

Evolution of Errors
Errors produced during the first two baseline sessions
and the last two treatment probes for each category were

compared for each participant. Errors were collapsed
into general (superordinate, circumlocutions, neologisms, and no responses) and specific (semantic and
phonemic errors). The proportions of errors by type are
included in Table 3.
Chi-square analyses, examining change in error
types, showed significant effects for all participants. For
Participant 1, changes were significant following treatment of both birds, 2(1, N = 55) = 24.5, p < .0001, and
vegetables, 2(1, N = 49) = 3.6, p < .05; for Participant 2,
significant changes were noted following treatment of
birds, 2(1, N = 56) = 8.95, p < .01, and vegetables, 2(1,
N = 44) = 4.3, p < .05; for Participant 3, changes were
significant for vegetables, 2(1, N = 30) = 4.39, p < .05;
and for Participant 4, changes were significant following treatment of vegetables, 2(1, N = 55) = 22.9, p <
.001, and birds, 2(1, N = 52) = 27.8, p < .001. For all
participants, decreases in the proportion of general responses and increases in specific errors were noted as

both categories were trained. The order of treatment
(whether typical or atypical items were trained first) had
no effect on the nature of errors produced.

Pre-Post Standardized Language
Measures
In general, all 4 participants demonstrated improvements on the standardized language tests conducted
following completion of treatment (see Table 2). Improvements were noted on the auditory comprehension subtests of WAB, while small or no improvements were
noted on naming subtests on the WAB and BNT. All 4
participants demonstrated improvements on the PALPA
subtests, where test scores improved by an average of
10 points after treatment compared to pretreatment (P1:
M = 14.8%, SD = .18; P2: M = 10.4%, SD = .10; P3: M =
13.5%, SD = .13; P4: M = 17.6%, SD = .13).

Discussion
Results of this experiment demonstrate that training atypical items within a category and their semantic
features results in generalization to naming of intermediate and typical examples of the category selected for
training. This effect was replicated on five separate occasions across 3 participants--for Participants 2 and 4
for both categories trained and for Participant 1 for the
second category (vegetables). In addition, the lack of generalization resulting from applying treatment to typical items within a category was replicated on two occasions across two participations--for Participant 1 for
birds and Participant 3 for vegetables. These data provide strong evidence that training atypical exemplars
is superior to training typical ones for facilitating generalization to untrained items. The finding is further
strengthened by considering the data from Participant
1, who received initial treatment focused on both typical (for birds) items and atypical (for vegetables) items,
showing a complete lack of generalization under typical
item training and robust generalization under atypical
item training. These findings have important implications for treatment of naming deficits in patients with
fluent aphasia. First, they show that semantically based
treatment, emphasizing underlying aspects of semantic representation and processing is a successful approach for training naming, as has been shown in other
studies examining semantic featural approaches (Boyle
& Coehlo, 1995; Drew & Thompson, 1999). Indeed, this
618

method results in stronger training effects than when
semantic cueing or picture-word matching techniques
are used as in, for example, Davis and Pring (1991) and
Howard et al. (1985b).
Secondly, our data indicate that the complexity effect found when controlling syntactic complexity in treatment of sentence deficits for agrammatism as noted by
Thompson and colleagues (Thompson et al., 1997, 1998,
2003) extends to the lexical-semantic domain in treating aphasic naming deficits. That is, training more complex items, which encompass variables relevant to simpler items, facilitates greater access to untrained items
than training simple items. This effect likely results
because, as shown by Plaut (1996) in connectionist simulation, exposure to items sharing some features of the
prototype as well as disparate features results in activation of both typical and atypical entries, whereas exposure to items with features similar to a semantic prototype results in a high probability of activating only a
limited set of items with comparable features. Similarly,
our findings with aphasic patients showed that training atypical items (which were quite dissimilar to the
category prototype with regard to semantic features)
highlighted the featural variation within categories,
whereas training the featural detail of typical items repeatedly emphasized only a few features that are common among typical items. Recall that for each category,
30 features were selected, of which 15 were defining features relevant to all typical items within the category
(e.g., has a beak, for birds). In addition, characteristic

features were selected, some of which were more applicable to the typical items (e.g., small in size, lives in
trees), while others covered a wider range relevant to
the atypical items (e.g., has long neck, lives near water
for birds). The main difference, then, between training
typical examples and atypical examples concerned the
variation of semantic features that were encountered in
treatment. Training typical items repeatedly emphasized
only a few features that were common among typical
items; training atypical items (which were dissimilar to
the category prototype) highlighted the featural variation within the category.
We recognize, however, that complexity in the semantic domain may be manifested differently than
what is observed in the syntactic domain. That is, for
sentence level deficits, grammatical representations
and relations among elements are denoted through syntactic trees with a discernable hierarchical structure.
Semantic representations (specifically, semantic categories), however, are considered to be represented in
multidimensional vector spaces depending on the degree of featural overlap (e.g., Hampton, 1993; Rosch &
Mervis, 1975; Smith et al., 1974), although Jackendoff
(1976, 1983) and others have also characterized lexical-semantic features in terms of tree structures. However, even if the representations involved in the two
domains differ substantively, the complexity effect appears to emerge when the items selected for training
encompass information relevant to untreated ones (i.e.,
they are in a subset relation; Thompson et al., 2003).
Here, typical items are composed of a subset of all features encountered within a semantic category. We,
therefore, conclude, as did Thompson et al. (2003), that
complexity is an overarching principle of recovery and
generalization.
It is also noteworthy that the patients who received
treatment on atypical items acquired all 24 items of the
category much faster than the patients trained on typical examples (e.g., Participant 2 required 6 weeks to
acquire all vegetable items compared to the 28 weeks
required by Participant 3). Therefore, the present results suggest that training atypical examples is a more
time efficient method for facilitating naming of category
exemplars than training typical examples.
Another important aspect of the present results concerns the evolution of errors noted throughout the study.
As noted above, although the number of errors was minimal by the end of treatment, all participants demonstrated
significant changes from pre- to posttreatment in the type
of errors produced. Prior to treatment, predominantly
general errors (i.e., superordinate labels, neologisms, and
no responses) were produced, indicating failure to access
specific semantic and/or phonological detail for target
items. Following treatment, accurate naming of trained

items and generalized naming to untrained items illustrated situations in which access to both semantic and
lexical/phonological representations was successful. The
evolution of general errors at the beginning of treatment
to semantic and phonemic errors at posttreatment suggest that although treatment resulted in a greater excitatory influence at the semantic/phonemic level during naming attempts, some type of interference occurred in the
process of correctly selecting the target word from activated entries. These data, then, provide further evidence
of the treatment effect, suggesting that the present treatment was successful in enhancing spreading activation
to semantically related targets within the category, but
that it was not entirely successful in ameliorating interference from multiple activated entries at either the semantic or phonological levels in naming attempts.
Finally, treatment resulted in improvements on
standardized language measures that were conducted
prior to and after treatment. Although improvements
were negligible on the BNT and the WAB, improvements
were evident on the auditory comprehension and semantic processing subtests of PALPA. It could be argued that
lack of generalization to items on BNT and across categories minimizes the clinical significance of the present
treatment. However, it should be emphasized that in
order to obtain maximal experimental control, semantic features were carefully selected to be applicable only
to the categories trained and, therefore, were not applicable to untrained categories. One process all patients
underwent during treatment was making explicit judgments about semantic features that were both imageable
(e.g., does it have wings?) and nonimageable (e.g., is it a
predator?). The effect of such practice was evident on
the semantic processing subtests on the PALPA, as participants improved by at least 10% on the semantic processing subtests.
We also point out that two important predictors for
language recovery, namely, severity of aphasia and months
postonset of the stroke (Kertesz, 1984), were controlled in
this experiment and, therefore, had no influence on the
generalization patterns observed. For instance, Participant 3 had the least severe deficit (WAB AQ = 70) prior to
initiation of treatment and was inducted into treatment
only 9 months following her stroke. This patient received
treatment for typical examples and did not generalize to
naming of intermediate or atypical examples. In contrast,
Participant 4 presented with a moderately severe aphasia prior to treatment (AQ = 46.4) and reportedly was
denied individual treatment prior to the present experiment, because her prognosis for improvement was considered poor. When trained on atypical examples, however, this patient generalized to naming of intermediate
and typical examples and also demonstrated remarkable
improvements on all other measures of language assessed
through the course of treatment. Finally, Participant 1,

who presented with moderately severe aphasia (AQ = 43.4)
and was 8 years postonset of stroke, did not generalize to
intermediate and atypical examples when trained on typical examples, but generalized to intermediate and typical
examples when trained on atypical examples.

Conclusion
The current findings provide support for a semantically based treatment, focused on the featural detail of
category items, for training naming in patients with fluent aphasia. The strong generalization effects observed
in the present study also indicate that the items selected
for treatment within categories are important to consider, in that training atypical items within semantic
categories results in generalization to untrained items,
whereas training typical items does not. These data suggest that the complexity account of treatment efficacy
advanced by Thompson et al. (2003) extends to the semantic domain. That is, like treatment for sentence production deficits in patients with agrammatic aphasia
(Thompson et al., 2003) and that for children with developmental phonological deficits (e.g., Geirut, 2001), the
most effective approach for training naming seems to
be to train more complex material first. These findings
challenge the long-standing clinical notion that treatment must begin from simpler tasks and proceed to the
more difficult ones. Instead, evidence such as that from
the present study illustrates the facilitative effects of
training more complex items that encompass variables
relevant to simpler items.

Appendix B. Treatment protocol for each target item.
1.

Picture naming. Initially, the participant was presented with the picture and was asked to name it. Irrespective of whether the
picture was named correctly or not, the experimenter explained that he/she would now be aided in understanding more about
the item.

2.

Category sorting. The examiner placed written category cards (birds/vegetables, animals, fruits, musical instruments) on the
table in random order. The examiner then randomized the 60 pictures and presented them 1 at a time for the participant to sort
by superordinate category, by placing each picture on its written category card. If incorrect, the picture was placed under the
accurate category label by the examiner.

3.

Feature selection. For this task, an icon board with separate slots for the target picture and six semantic features was used. The
examiner placed the target picture (e.g., chicken) in the center of the icon board and provided the participant with written
semantic feature cards belonging to the target category. The participant was then required to select the first six features that
were pertinent to the target example. For example, for chicken: lays eggs, is food were acceptable semantic features, whereas
flies distance, and swims were features that were not applicable. Once six features were selected, the participant was required
to read aloud the selected features.

4.

Yes/no questions. The participant was asked questions about the target example and was required to answer yes or no in
response. The experimenter then asked the patient 15 questions about the target example (e.g., chicken), which included five
acceptable semantic features (e.g., does it have wings?), five unacceptable semantic features from the same category (e.g., can
it fly?), and five semantic features from a different category (e.g., is it made of metal?).

5.

Picture naming. Same procedure as Step 1.
