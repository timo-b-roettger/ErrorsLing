Cognitive neuropsychological studies of bilingual patients with aphasia have contributed to our understanding of how the
brain processes different languages. The question we asked is whether differences in script have any impact on language
processing in bilingual aphasic patients who speak languages with different writing systems: Chinese and Mongolian. We
observed a pattern of greater impairment to written word comprehension and oral reading in L2 (Chinese) than in L1
(Mongolian) for two patients. We argue that differences in script have only a minimal effect on written word processing in
bilingual aphasia when the age of acquisition, word frequency and imageability of lexical items is controlled. Our conclusion
is that reading of familiar words in Mongolian and Chinese might not require independent cognitive systems or brain regions.

A key question in bilingualism is how different languages
are processed in the brain. Much of this research has
focussed on investigating whether language processing
in the first acquired language (L1) uses the same or
different brain regions to the second language (L2).
In the past decade, this question has been approached
using brain-imaging techniques including fMRI, EEG and
MEG studies of bilingual speakers (Vaid and Hull, 2002).
However a different method is to study bilingual speakers
who acquire language problems following brain damage
(aphasia).
Studies of bilingual aphasia date back to the late
nineteenth century (Fabbro, 1999), and today this methodology forms a part of the cognitive neuropsychological
approach to studying brain mechanisms in bilingual
language processing (Paradis, 1977, 1995; Gollan and
Kroll, 2001). These studies suggest that brain damage
produces dissociations in language processing, i.e. one
language can be more impaired than the other language
(Paradis, 1977). For example, some patients display a
pattern of DIFFERENTIAL RECOVERY from stroke whereby
L2 is recovered only after recovery in L1. Another pattern
is SELECTIVE RECOVERY whereby L2 is not recovered at
all. Two other patterns are ALTERNATING ANTAGONISM,
i.e. patients access one language in spontaneous speech
for alternating periods of time (Nilipour and Ashayeri,
1989; Paradis, Goldblum and Abidi, 1982) and SELECTIVE
APHASIA, i.e. impairment to one language with no deficits
to the other (Paradis and Goldblum, 1989). These

(HKU7275/03H).

patterns suggest that L1 and L2 may be processed
in different brain regions (Lebrun, 1971; Albert and
Obler, 1978; Benson, 1985; Cremaschi and Dujovny,
1996). An alternative view is that dissociations result
from extraneous factors. including age of acquisition,
premorbid proficiency and familiarity with each language
(Paradis, 2001) or the different linguistic properties of
L1 and L2 that constrain the possible manifestations
of aphasia in different languages (Nilipour and Paradis,
1995; Yiu and Worrall, 1995).
One controversy in the field of bilingual language
processing concerns the question of whether separate
brain regions are necessary for successful written word
identification in L1 and L2. Some evidence from brain
imaging suggests that written language processing in L1
and L2 activates separate brain regions (Dehaene et al.,
1997; Paulesu et al., 2000; Sakurai et al., 2000; Chen,
Fu and Iversen, 2002). If this claim is correct, then it
should be possible to observe selective impairment to
written language processing (dyslexia) in one language
and preserved processing in the other. Some studies
suggest that there are dissociations in impaired oral
reading in bilingual aphasia. For example, Masterson,
Coltheart and Meara (1985) reported a Spanish-English
speaker who produced more oral reading errors in English
(L2) than Spanish (L1). Raman and Weekes (2005)
reported a similar pattern in a Turkish-English speaker.
These data tend to support the claim that separate brain
regions are necessary for written language processing
within alphabetic scripts because brain damage selectively
disrupts written language processing. The contrasting
view is that dissociations in oral reading performance
across languages are the result of extraneous factors.

Indeed, when these variables are controlled adequately in
studies of normal language processing, the evidence from
brain imaging suggests that word identification in L1 and
L2 in fluent bilingual speakers recruits overlapping brain
regions (Uchida et al., 1997; Koyama et al., 1998; Chee
et al., 1999; Illes et al., 1999; Chee et al., 2000; Chee
et al., 2001).
Studies reporting selective disruption to written
language processing using cross-script comparisons in
biscriptal and bilingual speakers allow a relatively strong
test of the claim that separate brain regions may be
necessary for written word identification in L1 and L2
(Weekes, 2005). Some data suggest that the type of
script has an effect on the oral reading performance of
patients with bilingual aphasia. For example, Caramelli
et al. (1994) reported more reading and writing errors in
Japanese than Portuguese in a Brazilian "Nisei" patient,
even though their patient had acquired both languages at
an early age and he was a scribe in Japanese premorbidly.
Caramelli et al.'s patient showed a dissociation when
reading Japanese. The Japanese language uses two
scripts - Kana and Kanji. Both scripts are acquired at the
same age when learning to read and all literate speakers are
biscriptal. Their patient was more impaired at reading in
Kana than Kanji (and Portuguese) compatible with reports
of monolingual Japanese biscriptal aphasic patients with
acquired dyslexia in one script only (Sasanuma, 1975;
Sasanuma and Monoi, 1975; Iwata, 1984; though see
Sugishita et al., 1992). Beland and Mimouni (2001)
reported better reading of non-words in French (L2) than
Arabic (L1), and Eng and Obler (2002) reported more
semantic reading errors in Chinese (L1) than English (L2).
The question we asked here is whether differences in
script have an impact on the written language processing
of bilingual aphasic patients who speak East-Asian
languages with different orthography: Mongolian which
uses an alphabet and Chinese which uses a non-alphabetic
script. Alphabetic scripts are characterised by a finite
number of symbols that can be combined to produce
an infinite number of words and where a given symbol
does not represent meaning. By contrast, non-alphabetic
scripts such as Chinese and Japanese Kanji use a relatively
arbitrary system for mapping orthographic units onto
phonology. All Chinese characters are composed of
strokes formed into components that are written together
into a square shape to form a character. Ancient Chinese
characters were pictographic because the written character
portrayed the form of the object that it symbolised. So
for example, the character for "horse", /ma/, suggests
to some a figure galloping across the page. However,
few pictographic characters are used today. All characters
represent a morpheme in Chinese. This means that each
written word form is associated with a morpheme in the
spoken language. The script is therefore MORPHOGRAPHIC
(Yin and Rohsenow, 1994). Although mappings between

orthography and phonology are relatively opaque in nonalphabetic scripts, there are phonetic radicals that denote
a common pronunciation across characters. However,
these phonetic radicals are reliable in less than 40% of
characters containing them (Zhou, 1978).
Written Mongolian is called the Uighur script and
was invented by Ghengis Khan in the 13th century. It
is considered an alphabetic script that was derived from
Aramaic and shares a common source with Indo-European
and Semitic alphabets (Poppe, 1970). Although Uighur
was replaced by Cyrillic in the Republic of Mongolia,
the traditional script has remained in use in Chinesecontrolled Inner Mongolia, where it is taught with Chinese
characters to all children. Symbols are written from left to
right in a vertical orientation from top to bottom and all
letters in a word are connected by a continuous pen stroke.
Words are written in a continuous line that runs vertically
with lines and loops written to the left as the word progresses downward. Some examples of Mongolian script,
including the word bolon "and" are shown in Figure 1.
Like other Turkic languages, vowel harmony is an
important part of the grammar (Poppe, 1954). There
are two groups of vowels called masculine (A/O/U) and
feminine (E/U) and there are three different versions of a
vowel that are depicted in print based on their respective
position in the word. These are referred to as Initial,
Medial and Final. One letter is used when the vowel is
in the first syllable of a word, and another for subsequent
occurrences of the vowel in a word. Therefore, although
Mongolian is alphabetic, letters can be ambiguous and
understanding word context may be necessary to read
aloud correctly. For example, the word bolon could be
read as different words (letter combinations) and thus
requires knowledge of the language to be read correctly
(Poppe, 1970). This is different to other alphabetic scripts
such as Turkish where the mappings between print and
sound always generate a correct response. It is interesting
to note that although Uighur symbols do not represent
morphemes in the same way as Chinese, access to meaning
from print may be necessary in both scripts for the skilled
processing of written words.
In our view the extant evidence for an effect of
script on the written language processing of patients with
bilingual aphasia is relatively weak. This is because few
studies have controlled test stimuli for critical variables
such as the age of acquisition, premorbid proficiency
and word familiarity with lexical items - all variables
that have an impact on bilingual language processing
(Paradis, 2001). Other factors that affect performance
include word frequency and imageability of word forms,
i.e. low imageability words such as justice are usually
more impaired than high imageability words such as
house (Kiran and Tuchtenhagen, 2005). We controlled
these critical variables in two ways. First, we recruited
patients who acquired written Mongolian and Chinese

at approximately the same (young) age, to minimise
any effects of age of acquisition of L2 on performance.
Second, we compared performance in both languages
using high frequency words that are common nouns,
e.g. "star", "cat", "eye" in order to minimise effects of
premorbid proficiency.
Case descriptions
Bilingual Mongolian-Chinese stroke patients were
recruited from Tongliao People's Hospital in InnerMongolia Autonomous District. Biographical details of
each case including results from CT are shown in Table 1.
Lesion location was variable across patients and not a
criterion for selection. All patients were native speakers

of Mongolian (L1) who learned to speak Chinese
(L2) at an early age. Patients were recruited into the
study according to several criteria, including formal
instruction in reading and writing in Chinese during
elementary school, at least average premorbid IQ based
on education and work history and a preserved ability
to comprehend task instructions. We used the Chinese
Aphasia Examination Scale (Wang, Gao and Hu, 1988)
and a translation of that scale in Mongolian (by the last
author), to screen all patients for language problems in
Mongolian and Chinese. The purpose of screening was to
ensure participants were capable of comprehending task
instructions in both languages. Participants performed
tests of auditory comprehension and expression, including
serial word recall, word repetition, object naming, colour

naming, spoken word picture matching, responding to
command, short passage understanding, and picture-
picture matching as well as reading of words, passages and
phrases. Results from the test battery in both languages
are summarised in Table 2. Although the number of items
on each subtest was small (n = 3) it is notable that withinpatient differences in language impairment in Chinese
and Mongolian were minimal. Patients were excluded
if they did not perform above 90% correct on spokenword-picture-matching tasks in both languages. These
criteria produced eight patients over a five-year period. It is
important to note also that screening excluded a number of
bilingual patients and so our results will be limited to understanding lexical processing in patients with preserved
word comprehension in Mongolian and Chinese.
Experimental investigations
All patients were given four lexical processing tasks: oral
reading, lexical decision, written-word-picture matching,

and spoken-word-picture matching. Each task was
presented on two different occasions separated by
at least a week and items were presented in either
Chinese or Mongolian with order counterbalanced across
participants to minimise effects of expectation of a
bilingual environment (Grosjean, 1998, 2001). Words
were selected according to several criteria: concrete
words that are acquired early, high imageability and high
frequency. Stimuli were thus highly familiar to all patients
in both languages premorbidly. Each task contained the
same lexical items (n = 14), reported in the Appendix
("star", "cat", "eye", "ship", "table", "ox", "square",
"grandmother", "skirt", "egg", "elephant", "bowl", "fish",
"woman"). Performance is summarised in Table 3.
ANOVA found a significant effect of task F(1,7) =
2.90, p < .05 but no effect of script and no interaction
between script and task. Performance in oral reading was
more impaired than all other tasks. Inspection of Table 3
shows that this effect was observed for a subset of patients
only. For patients BG, XGL and DY, there was little

impairment on any task in either script. For patient BY,
performance on most tasks was at floor. Given our primary
interests, we selected patients for further analysis only
if there were differences in performance across scripts
(patients TGX, WT, SL and LH). We then examined the
effect of script on performance for each task on a case by
case basis. It is common in cognitive neuropsychological
studies of lexical processing in aphasia to report task
effects for individual cases separately. One rationale for
this procedure is that grouping patients can mask effects
that are due to individual variability in brain damaged
patients (Caramazza, 1984). Inspection of Table 3 shows
a different pattern of effects across our selected patients.
Therefore, the data will be reported and analysed
separately for each case.
We used McNemar's (1947) test to compare performance across the same lexical items in both languages for
all tasks. This statistic gives an estimate of the significance
of the difference between two correlated proportions
following a Chi-squared distribution (Ferguson, 1966).
For patient TGX, reading was impaired in both languages
and there was a significant effect of task on performance.
However, there was no significant effect of script on any
task. Lexical decision in Chinese was significantly better
than oral reading X2 (1) = 4.0, p < .05. TGX produced
semantic errors in oral reading of written words in Mongolian, e.g. "woman" read as "teacher" and in Chinese,
e.g. "ox" read as "horse". For patient WT, there was a
significant effect of script on written word comprehension
which was worse in Chinese than Mongolian X2 (1) = 4.1,
p < .05 but no effect of script on other tasks. There were
also effects of task, i.e. written word comprehension in
Chinese was worse than oral reading X2 (1) = 5.0, p < .05
and lexical decision X2 (1) = 6.0, p < .05. However, there
were no significant effects of task on lexical processing in
Mongolian. For patient SL, there were effects of script on
performance in written word comprehension X2 (1) = 6.0,
p < .05, spoken word comprehension X2 (1) = 6.0, p < .05

and oral reading X2 (1) = 5.0, p < .05. However, lexical
decision was preserved in both languages. Similarly,
for patient SL, there were significant effects of
task in both languages. Oral reading in Mongolian
was more impaired than lexical decision X2 (1) =
6.0, p < .05, and written word comprehension X2 (1) =
5.0, p < .05 and in Chinese spoken word comprehension
X2 (1) = 6.0, p < .05 and oral reading were more
impaired than lexical decision X2 (1) = 11.0, p < .05,
written word comprehension X2 (1) = 4.1, p < .05 and
spoken word comprehension X2 (1) = 5.0, p < .05. SL
produced semantic errors in Mongolian and Chinese, and
"translation errors", i.e. reading aloud a Chinese word
with a Mongolian syllable. There was also an effect of
script on performance for patient LH but in oral reading
only X2 (1) = 4.0, p < .05. There were significant effects of
task for LH in both languages. Oral reading in Mongolian
was worse than written word comprehension X2 (1) = 7.0,
p < .05 and spoken word comprehension X2 (1) = 7.0,
p < .05, and oral reading in Chinese was worse than
lexical decision X2 (1) = 13.0, p < .05, written word
comprehension X2 (1) = 11.0, p < .05 and spoken word
comprehension X2 (1) = 11.00, p < .05. LH produced
semantic errors in Mongolian, e.g. "table" read as "stool"
but not in Chinese. To summarise, there was an effect
of script on written word comprehension for TGX, SL
and LH with worse performance in Chinese (L2) than
Mongolian (L1), and for two patients - SL and LH - type
of script had an effect on oral reading which was more
impaired for both in L2 than L1.
We performed further testing with SL and LH on all
tasks one month after first testing. Our rationale for further
testing was to test for patterns of alternating recovery.
Performance at first testing (Time 1) and second testing
(Time 2) is summarised in Table 4. For patient SL,
oral reading in Mongolian improved significantly over
time X2 (1) = 6.0, p < .05 as did oral reading in Chinese
X2 (1) = 8.0, p < .05, written comprehension in Chinese

X2 (1) = 7.0, p < .05 and spoken word comprehension in
Chinese X2 (1) = 5.0, p < .05. Thus, the effects of script
on lexical processing at Time 1 were no longer significant
at Time 2. For patient LH, oral reading in Mongolian
also improved significantly X2 (1) = 9.0, p < .05 as did
lexical decision in Mongolian X2 (1) = 7.0, p < .05 and
oral reading in Chinese X2 (1) = 6.0, p < .05. There was
no significant improvement to lexical decision, written
word comprehension or spoken word comprehension in
Chinese. However, the effect of script at Time 2 was significant for oral reading only X2 (1) = 7.0, p < .05. Thus, the
effects of script on lexical processing observed on initial
testing had a sustained impact on oral reading for patient
LH only. We also observed that even though written and
spoken comprehension of an item improved significantly
in both languages, e.g. for patient SL the word "ship" and
for LH the word "rectangle", oral reading of these items
did not improve in either language during recovery.
Discussion
The results reveal new findings relevant to bilingual
aphasia. For two patients, SL and LH, we found that
performance on tests of written word processing was more
impaired in L2 (Chinese) than L1 (Mongolian). These
results are compatible with evidence of dissociations in
language processing following brain damage that affects
L2 more than L1 (Paradis, 1977; Masterson et al.,
1985; Caramelli et al., 1994; Ferrand and Humphreys,
1996; Fabbro, 1999; Beland and Mimouni, 2001; Gollan
and Kroll, 2001; Eng and Obler, 2002; Edmonds and
Kiran, 2004; Raman and Weekes, 2005). The present
results extend those observations to lexical processing
in East-Asian languages. Despite our observations, the
evidence for an effect of script on written language
processing was relatively weak. This suggests to us that

if extraneous factors including the age of acquisition,
premorbid proficiency and familiarity with each language
are well controlled, dissociations in written language
processing following brain damage are limited.
Our results are more compatible with the view
that differences in brain activation during written word
identification in L1 and L2 result from variability in
proficiency and familiarity with the script (Sugishita
et al., 1992; Koyama et al., 1998; Chee et al., 2001). For
example, in the study by Chen et al. (2002), adult biscriptal
Putonghua speakers were asked to identify written words
presented as characters or pinyin (alphabetic) symbols
with the former activating frontal regions and the
latter activating parietal regions. However, after initial
instruction when learning to read in Chinese, pinyin
symbols are rarely encountered in printed text. Thus,
pinyin symbols are relatively unfamiliar to most adult
Chinese speakers. We therefore advise caution when
interpreting an effect of script on written word processing
in acquired dyslexia in bilingual and biscriptal patients
if differences in word age of acquisition, proficiency and
familiarity are not adequately controlled.
Models of oral reading in Chinese can explain the
pattern of impaired oral reading shown by patients TGX,
SL and LH. Weekes, Chen and Yin (1997) argued
that normal oral reading in Chinese can proceed via
at least two pathways: a lexical semantic pathway that
allows reading for meaning; and a non-semantic pathway
linking input orthographic representations, i.e. strokes,
radicals and characters to phonological representations,
i.e. syllables and tones. This framework is illustrated in
Figure 2 (see also Yin and Weekes, 2003). Impaired oral
reading with preserved lexical decision can be explained
by reduced access to mappings between orthographic
and phonological representations or reduced activation
in phonological representations themselves. That was the
pattern shown by patients TGX and SL. Patient LH,
who showed more severely impaired oral reading (at first
testing), also showed impairment on lexical decision tasks
in Chinese, which could result from reduced activation
within orthographic representations. The framework in
Figure 2 also explains impaired comprehension with
spared reading in Chinese - the pattern shown by patient
WT who was able to read characters aloud better than
comprehend the same characters from printed or spoken
word input. Damage to the lexical semantic pathway
would result in impaired written word comprehension
with intact oral reading. Preserved oral reading with
impaired comprehension has been reported in other
Chinese speakers. For example, Weekes et al. (1997)
described an anomic Putonghua speaker who was unable
to name pictured objects (depicted in the figure as a
break between semantic representations and phonological
output) but who could read the printed characters of
the names perfectly. As anomia reflects the operation of

Oral reading in bilingual aphasia

Figure 2. A functional model of reading and writing in Chinese. The arrows represent the direction of access from one level
of representation to another during normal oral reading and writing to dictation. The broken arrow depicts the locus of
damage for patients who have anomia without dyslexia.

the lexical semantic system in all models of language
processing, ANOMIA WITHOUT DYSLEXIA in Chinese shows
that even if a lexical semantic pathway is impaired it is
possible to read aloud in Chinese. This dissociation has
also been observed in other patients (Law, 2004; Han
et al., 2005; Law, Wong and Chui, 2005; Bi et al., in
press).
Although there is no model of oral reading in
Mongolian, the framework in Figure 2 allows us to
compare disorders of oral reading in Mongolian with
Chinese. A written word form presented in either script
for normal oral reading will activate an orthographic
representation as well as lexical representations related
by meaning via the lexical semantic pathway and by
phonology in the non-semantic pathway. An oral reading
response in either language could then be produced.
However, errors will not be produced routinely during
the oral reading of non-brain-damaged bilingual speakers.

This is because input from the non-semantic pathway
can inhibit semantically related (although incorrect)
responses and input from the lexical semantic pathway can
inhibit phonologically related errors. Damage to the nonsemantic pathway however may result in over-reliance
on lexical semantic reading, leading to semantic and
cross-linguistic reading errors. Evidence of interactions
between pathways in monolingual Chinese speakers is
now plentiful. For example, Law (2004) reported that
patient LKK produced more semantic errors in picture
naming than reading, suggesting that semantic reading
errors can be inhibited with sufficient input from the
non-semantic reading pathway (see also Han et al.,
2005; Bi et al., in press). In the case of biscriptal
Chinese-Mongolian patients, damage to the non-semantic
pathway will lead to reliance on lexical semantic reading
resulting in the possibility of translation errors (see also
Raman and Weekes, 2005). The framework in Figure 2

thus allows a division of labour in oral reading across
scripts for bilingual speakers without the requirement of
separate lexica for word forms in L1 (Mongolian) and L2
(Chinese). This is compatible with most contemporary
models of bilingual word recognition (Dijkstra and van
Heuven, 2002; Kroll and Dijkstra, 2002; Brysbaert and
Dijkstra, 2006).
In sum, we found evidence of bilingual aphasia in
Mongolian-Chinese speaking patients recovering from
stroke. Ours is the first reported investigation of impaired
language processing in Mongolian and the first report of
bilingual aphasia and acquired dyslexia in Mongolian-
Chinese speakers. The patterns of performance reported
are compatible with cognitive models that assume
oral reading in the less dominant language can be
selectively inhibited after brain damage (Green, 2005).
Our conclusion is that oral reading of familiar words
in Mongolian and Chinese does not require independent
cognitive systems or separate brain regions.
