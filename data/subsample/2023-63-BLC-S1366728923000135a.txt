Abstract
English is imposed as the language of instruction in multiple linguistically diverse societies
where there is more than one official language. This might have negative educational consequences for people whose first language (L1) is not English. To investigate this, 47 South
Africans with advanced English proficiency but different L1s (L1-English vs. L1-Zulu) were
evaluated in their listening comprehension ability. Specifically, participants listened to narrative texts in English which prompted an initial inference followed by a sentence containing an
expected inference or an unexpected but plausible concept, assessing comprehension monitoring. A final question containing congruent or incongruent information in relation to the text
information followed, assessing the revision process. L1-English participants were more
efficient at monitoring and revising their listening comprehension. Furthermore, individual
differences in inhibitory control were associated with differences in revision. Results show
that participants' L1 appears to supersede their advanced English proficiency on highly
complex listening comprehension.

Introduction
The ability to draw inferences from auditory and written input is crucial for comprehension
and successful educational outcomes and is especially relevant in linguistically diverse contexts
where learners have heterogeneous language backgrounds but are educated in the predominant, privileged language of the country. Such a case is South Africa, where tertiary education is
almost exclusively received through the medium of English (Madadzhe, 2019), though it is not
the first language (L1) for the majority of the population but for only 9.6% of citizens
(Statistics South Africa, 2012). This makes South Africa a unique context to investigate language effects in listening comprehension in a sample that scarcely (if at all) comprises
`pure' monolinguals but is home to individuals that widely differ in their L1 and degree of
multilingualism. Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to investigate how advanced
English proficient South African adults differing in their L1 (English or Zulu) perform on listening text comprehension in the language of instruction (English). We first provide an overview of the language and educational context in South Africa, followed by an account of the
cognitive and linguistic processes involved in text comprehension in both reading and listening
modalities.

Young adults completing tertiary education in South Africa are exposed to regular comprehension of complex and novel content. Learners entering a university are required to, at minimum, understand, speak, read, and write in standard, university-level English if they are to
be adept and competitive (South African Department of Education, 2008). While this
seems like an unreasonable expectation given how few South Africans have English as an
L1, the post-apartheid government has attempted to put educational safeguards in place
that aim to ensure adequate English competency by tertiary education, while still promoting
multilingualism (Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996; Department of
Education, 1997). While, in principle, the language-in-education policy is linguistically inclusive, in reality, multilingual education still remains imbalanced, with English (and to a lesser
extent, Afrikaans) being prioritised and disproportionally supported (Drummond, 2016; van
Wyk, 2014). English medium schools are by far the most prevalent across South Africa
(Webb, Lafon & Pare, 2010), so over the past two decades the majority of South Africans
have received education in English as the language of learning and teaching throughout
their schooling career. This disparity is multidimensional but in a large part due to the elevated status that English occupies, as well as access to educational resources and teaching

material in English, and the conception that English is a global
lingua franca that can lead to more long-term social and economic opportunities and mobility (Madadzhe, 2019; Mesthrie,
2002). Similarly, English is ubiquitous across government,
media, and industry, so it is indeed privileged in this regard
and considered the country's linguistic bridge.
It can therefore be assumed that South Africans entering university have prolonged and sustained exposure to English both in
and out of the school context as well as high levels of proficiency
to meet the language requirements necessary to be accepted to an
institution of higher education.1 Few studies have investigated differences between highly English proficient adult learners, but who
enter educational systems with different L1s. We are particularly
interested in L1 as opposed to LINGUALISM STATUS (monolingual,
bilingual) because L1 is a highly informative indicator of foundational language background in the South African context, given
the (mis)alignment that it has in comparison to the medium of
tertiary education. Importantly, the question of whether individuals' L1 supersedes their proficiency in listening text comprehension has not previously been explored. There is, however,
concrete evidence to suggest that comprehension ability is predicted by proficiency (Filippi, Leech, Thomas, Green & Dick,
2012), particularly in school-aged children (Babayiit &
Shapiro, 2020; Melby-Lervag & Lervag, 2014; Pretorius &
Spaull, 2016), but it is unclear whether young adults situated in
a multilingual context who have advanced proficiency in
English (i.e., the language of learning and teaching) but differ
in their L1 (in this case, L1-Zulu) are able to perform equally
well on a demanding comprehension task compared to
L1-English participants.
High-level text comprehension processes
Comprehension is the process of extracting meaning from visual
and/or auditory stimuli as opposed to a mere verbatim record of
the presented content. It involves the interplay between worldknowledge (top-down processing) in conjunction with the accumulated content-based information of the text (bottom-up processing) so that the comprehenders can construct an integrated
and coherent mental representation of the content that clarifies
its meaning (for reviews, see Aryadoust, 2019; McNamara &
Magliano, 2009). This mental representation is referred to as a
SITUATION MODEL (Kintsch, 1998). As each word or phrase is processed, it is actively integrated into the situation model of comprehenders such that text coherence can be achieved. At the lexical or
sentence level, word meanings are retrieved and systematically
grouped into meaningful grammatical units, while at the discourse level, other higher-level cognitive skills are engaged to be
able to construct a unified, coherent, and accurate representation
of the content in real time (Rapp, van den Broek, McMaster,
Kendeou & Espin, 2007; van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). Relevant
higher-level comprehension processes that play a role in text
coherence include INFERENCING, MONITORING, and REVISION.
INFERENCING is the ability to deduce information from content
without it being explicitly referred to (Cook & O'Brien, 2017;
Graesser, Singer & Trabasso, 1994; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998).
An important inference affecting language processing is prediction - the capacity to precedingly anticipate incoming information or adapt to situations where conflicting or ambiguous

information arises that deviates from one's expectations (Bubic,
von Cramon & Schubotz, 2010; Pickering & Gambi, 2018). For
example, in (1) the target word "son" is highly semantically constraining and expected, while in (2) the target word "dog" is less
semantically constraining - that is, unexpected, but still plausible.
When presented with examples such as (2) where the inference is
not expected, prediction errors (e.g., processing delays, decline in
accuracy) are likely to arise, especially where the strength of the
generated prediction is robust, or the content is presented in a
second language (Kaan & Gruter, 2021). Importantly, prediction
errors are not confined to single sentences like (1) and (2) but
may emerge in longer narratives where knowledge-based inferences
have been generated based on the establishing content, as in (3).
(1) The mother has two daughters and one son
(2) The mother has two daughters and one dog (adapted from
Dijkstra, Van Hell & Brenders, 2015)
COMPREHENSION MONITORING is the active, metacognitive strategy
that facilitates awareness of what is being comprehended, whereby
efficient comprehenders are able to rapidly notice information
that does not align with previously presented content so as to disambiguate their predictions (Baker, 1989; McNamara, 2007;
Wagoner, 1983; Zhang, 2017). A consistent outcome is a time
cost on unexpected compared to expected sentences because of
noticeable disruptions to text coherence (O'Brien, Rizzella,
Albrecht and Halleran, 1998; Rinck & Weber, 2003). For instance,
following passage (3), participants have to adjust their expectations with reference to additional incoming content that is either
expected and aligns (4a) or unexpected and misaligns (4b) with
the prior information. Efficient comprehenders are able to rapidly
notice information that does not align with previously presented
content in order to disambiguate their predictions (McNamara,
2007; Zhang, 2017).
(3) In the lake by my house there are many animals that make
quacking noises. Yesterday the sounds were really loud, so I
went to see which animals were making them.
(4a) On a big rock in the middle of the lake, I could see the ducks
(4b) On a big rock in the middle of the lake, I could see the
turtles
Moreover, in situations where upcoming information does not
match with a previously generated inference as the narrative
unfolds and further information is presented, comprehenders
need to review their existing interpretation and update their situation model so that the new and unexpected content becomes
meaningfully integrated into the discourse context, in a process
known as REVISION (Rapp & Kendeou, 2007). Participants need
to update their situation model in order to identify whether the
content is congruent (4a  5a or 4b  5b) or incongruent (4a
 5b or 4b  5a) in relation to preceding information.
Revision of the situation model is achieved only if comprehension
of the text is adequately regulated by inhibiting the original interpretation that was encoded into the situation model in favour of
the new, updated interpretation - an updating process that is
both linguistically and cognitively demanding (Kendeou, Smith
& O'Brien, 2013; Rapp & Kendeou, 2007). Central to the revision
process is a distinction between the processes of updating and
outdating, whereby the former involves the encoding and integration of new information into the mental representation of the text,
while the latter entails a disregarding and replacement of the no

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

longer-true, irrelevant, and outdated information that disrupts the
text's coherence (Kendeou et al., 2013). Outdated information is
expected to decay in line with the presentation of new, harmonious information and should be deactivated from the current mental model, losing its accessibility (Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998).
Much of the time this is borne out such that comprehenders
can successfully update their situation model (de Vega, 1995;
Rapp & Taylor, 2004). However, it has also been demonstrated
that while revision can be achieved, processing delays may be
incurred as a direct consequence of maintaining the outdated
information in the situation model (de Vega, Urrutia & Riffo,
2007; Gueraud, Harmon & Peracchi, 2005; O'Brien, Cook &
Gueraud, 2010); Rapp & Kendeou, 2007). In such cases, comprehension can be disrupted.

The majority of research conducted on high-level comprehension
processes has focussed on reading rather than listening comprehension (for a review, see McNamara & Magliano, 2009) and
even fewer studies have evaluated comprehension from a multimodal perspective (Hu & Jiang, 2011; Manfredi, Cohn, Andreoli
& Boggio, 2018; Perez, Schmidt, Kourtzi & Tsimpli, 2020; Wu
& Ma., 2016). Despite this asymmetry, the processes involved in
reading and listening comprehension appear to overlap in critical
ways and rely on similar bottom-up and top-down mechanisms
(Rost, 2005, 2016). They also act simultaneously and in parallel
by drawing on various types of knowledge sources including linguistic, world, and context-based knowledge (Vandergrift, 2007)
as well as depend on the proficiency/language background of
the listener, their working memory capacity, and the amount of
inhibitory control needed to process the content (Kim, 2015;
Perez, Paolieri, Macizo & Bajo, 2014; Rapp et al., 2007). In fact,
although for proficient listeners the process can be largely automatic, listeners have some control over their degree of engagement and attentional allocation of the input being attended to
(Bodie, Worthington, Imhof & Cooper, 2008). That is, listening
can be effortful with more challenging contexts (e.g., L2 comprehension) compared to less demanding contexts (e.g., L1 comprehension). Crucially, there is a gap in the literature of listening
comprehension when the language tested is not the participant's
L1 and when multilingualism is characteristic of the individual
and societal context.
High-level text comprehension and inhibitory control
Inhibitory control (IC) and working memory have routinely been
associated with comprehension ability (Perez et al., 2014; Tarchi,
Ruffini & Pecini, 2021). In a significant study for the present
research, Perez et al. (2016) investigated how adults monitor
and revise their situation model after encountering unexpected
information. Using the mismatch detection paradigm, participants were presented with a series of short narrative texts where
the first sentences primed a knowledge-based inference as in
(3), followed by a sentence that either brought an expected
("ducks") or unexpected but plausible ("turtles") word, as in
(4a) and (4b). Results revealed that readers were able to detect a
mismatch on unexpected compared to expected words, indicating
a good ability to monitor inferential information in real time. In

867

addition, following the establishing text, participants were then
presented with one of two comprehension sentences that brought
either congruent or incongruent information in reference to the
content of the prior text, as in (5a) and (5b). This time, readers
with lower verbal (but not visuospatial) working memory had
longer reading times and made more regressions on congruent
sentences only after being exposed to the unexpected word ("turtles"  "shells"). The authors suggested that the revision process is
more cognitively demanding than the monitoring process and it
depends on (verbal) working memory capacity (also see
Carretti, Borella, Cornoldi & De Beni, 2009). Importantly, a similar relationship has been found with IC and its influence on the
quality of the mental representation that is constructed during
reading and oral single word comprehension (Arrington,
Kulesz, Francis, Fletcher & Barnes, 2014; Blumenfeld & Marian,
2011). Interestingly, the effect of working memory in revision disappears when IC is taken into account to explain individual differences in multimodal (auditory-verbal and visual-pictorial)
comprehension in L1-English speakers (Perez et al., 2020) since
IC is thought to encompass aspects of working memory (Tiego,
Testa, Bellgrove, Pantelis & Whittle, 2018). IC is therefore an
important executive function to consider when measuring the
process of revision in text comprehension, but it has not been
solely assessed during listening comprehension.
Finally, a study investigating high-level cognitive processes
during reading comprehension in the L1 and L2 also found that
executive control (in addition to L2 proficiency) explained individual differences in the revision process (Perez, Hansen &
Bajo, 2019). Specifically, efficient revision in the L1 was related
to a balance between proactive control (the ability to sustain
information related to a meaning goal in anticipation of a cue)
and reactive control (the ability to reactivate meaning goals as a
response to a cue), whereas better revision in the L2 was associated with strong proactive control. Thus, a relevant matter
here is to understand whether in developing and multilingual
countries such as South Africa, where English is imposed as the
official language in tertiary education, L1-English speakers have
better performance on high-level listening comprehension ability,
or whether people with a different L1 background (L1-Zulu) but
high L2-English2 proficiency perform equally well.
The present study
The main aim of this study was to investigate how advanced
English proficient South African adults differing in their L1
(English or Zulu) perform on listening text comprehension in
the language of instruction (English). The present study expands
on research that has assessed inferential monitoring and revision
during reading and multimodal comprehension (Perez et al.,
2016, 2020) by presenting narrative texts only in the auditory
modality. By comparing L1-English vs. L1-Zulu populations in
their ability to perform inferencing, monitoring, and revision,
we can understand the importance of L1 experience over and
above task proficiency in individuals from multilingual contexts.
An additional aim was to understand if the effects derived from
the main goal were explained by individual differences in IC,
especially regarding the revision process.
To test our aims, we used an auditory version of the mismatch
detection task (Perez et al., 2016) - henceforth, AMDT. In this

term to denote a language acquired after the L1.

task, narrative texts comprising three parts (establishing, critical,
and comprehension) are auditorily presented to participants in
succession (see Table 1). The first two sentences establish the context of the story by describing a scenario that biases a knowledgebased inference generated at the level of the situation model
("ducks"). Response latency (RL) after listening to the establishing
sentences provides a "baseline RL". A third sentence is then presented in one of two possible conditions that either aligns and is
consistent with the prior primed narrative content (expected condition: "ducks") or misaligns and is unlikely but still provides valid
and plausible information (unexpected condition: "turtles"). In
this sentence, the unexpected condition requires participants to
re-evaluate their mental representation in relation to their initial
inference, while in the expected condition no re-evaluation is
necessary since the content confirms the prediction biased in
the establishing context. Only the last word of the critical sentence
is manipulated for each narrative with the rest of the wording
being identical, thus allowing for participants to experience either
expected or unexpected information at the same point in the critical sentence in all cases. RL after listening to the critical sentences
gives the "target word RL". Importantly, to extract a more pure
processing time, the target word RL is divided by the baseline
RL (i.e., "pure target word RL"), which is used as an index of comprehension monitoring.
Lastly, a final comprehension sentence is again auditorily presented also in one of two possible conditions: a congruent sentence in which the content relates to the information from the
target concept in the critical sentence (e.g., "feathers" for
"ducks" or "shells" for "turtles"); or an incongruent sentence
where the content does not relate to the target concept in the critical sentence (e.g., "shells" for "ducks" or "feathers" for "turtles").
Here, participants have to revise the content presented to them
and indicate whether the comprehension sentence matches the
information presented in the critical sentence. RL from the
onset of the question mark to the onset of the "Yes/No" response
to the comprehension sentence gives the "sentence RL". Similar to
the monitoring process, this measure is divided by the baseline RL
to obtain a more pure processing time (i.e., "pure sentence RL"),
and this measure works as an index of revision. Finally, accuracy
scores are also recorded in the comprehension sentence, as a
second measure of revision.
Aims and hypotheses
The first aim of this study is to investigate the effect of L1 on
high-level comprehension processes in text listening comprehension in English proficient young South African adults completing
a tertiary education, and secondly, to evaluate whether individual
differences in IC modulate prior effects. Accordingly, our hypotheses are as follows. For the COMPREHENSION MONITORING PROCESS, we
expect greater prediction interference (increased pure target word
RLs) for all comprehenders when they are presented with unexpected compared to expected critical words (Hypothesis 1).
Furthermore, L1-Zulu participants are predicted to respond comparatively slower to the unexpected condition than L1-English
participants because of the misalignment between their L1 and
that of the task, while no differences between groups are anticipated for the expected condition where no conflict arises
(Hypothesis 2).
For the REVISION PROCESS, given that RLs have been found to
increase and accuracy to decrease when sentence coherence is
disrupted in general and as a consequence of proficiency (e.g.,
Perez et al., 2016, 2019, 2020), we expect pure sentence RLs to

Mandy Wigdorowitz, Ana I. Perez and Ianthi M. Tsimpli

be higher (Hypothesis 3) and accuracy to be lower
(Hypothesis 4) for comprehenders in conditions where there is
prediction interference (expected-incongruent, unexpectedcongruent, unexpected-incongruent), specifically where revision
is needed, i.e., for critical sentences containing unexpected target
words followed by congruent or incongruent comprehension
sentences. Similarly, we predict RLs to be higher (Hypothesis
5) and accuracy to be lower (Hypothesis 6) in L1-Zulu participants compared to L1-English participants on all but the
expected-congruent (easiest) condition, given the mismatch
between Zulu participants' L1 and the language of the task,
while for L1-English participants, no such interference should
emerge. These findings would indicate difficulties for L2
English speakers to revise their situation model during highlevel listening comprehension in English.
According to the second aim, IC is not expected to explain
individual differences for young adults in the monitoring process, because as compared to the revision process, text monitoring is easier and less cognitively demanding (Perez et al.,
2016; Hypothesis 7). However, for the revision process, we predict IC to modulate the effect of listening comprehension performance given that comprehenders with higher IC could be
better at managing this type of conflict by suppressing prior
conflicting information (Perez et al., 2020), and in particular,
we expect IC to be associated with conditions that tap into
the revision process specifically (unexpected-congruent and
unexpected-incongruent conditions), such that those with better IC will answer the comprehension sentences more efficiently and/or with lower RLs (Hypothesis 8). Finally,
L1-Zulu participants with higher IC could also show a more
comparable pattern in the revision process, similar to the one
manifested by L1-English participants (Hypothesis 9; Perez
et al., 2019).
Method
Participants
Participants were 47 South Africans between 18-24 years old
(Mage = 19.53, SD = 1.37) who were completing an undergraduate degree at an English-medium university in Johannesburg
(years of tertiary education: M = 1.11, SD = .98). Based on
their reported language background, participants were divided
into two groups: L1-Zulu (n = 22; Mage = 19.59, SD = 1.37) and
L1-English (n = 25; Mage = 19.48, SD = 1.39) speakers, where
L1 is operationalised as the first language participants learned
as a child. Participants also listed their home, spoken, and written languages, the language(s) they were formally taught in during primary and secondary schooling, as well as their use of
English among various interlocutors. Descriptive details about
this linguistic information can be found in Appendix
A. Importantly, all participants were highly proficient in
English, but, as expected, L1-Zulu participants used English
for fewer years on average than L1-English participants: 14.71
compared to 18.80 years, t(44) = -5.51, p < .001.

four-sentence narrative texts sourced from Perez et al. (2020)3, in
one of the two possible critical sentence conditions (expected or
unexpected) and one of the two possible comprehension
sentence conditions (congruent or incongruent). As such, four
versions were created and counterbalanced so that each of the
40 narratives were presented to participants only once in one of
the four cross-conditions, with 10 trials per cross-condition
(expected-congruent, expected-incongruent, unexpected-congruent,
unexpected-incongruent). The trials were presented in randomised order across two blocks. To begin each trial, the establishing sentence was played when participants pressed the spacebar.
Immediately afterwards, a fixation cross appeared in the centre
of the screen. Participants pressed the spacebar again to cue the
soundtrack of the critical sentence, and when it was finished, a
second fixation cross appeared. Participants pressed the spacebar
to hear the final comprehension sentence. This time, after the
comprehension sentence was played, a question mark appeared
and participants were instructed to press "Yes" (`M' key) if this
sentence matched with the information presented in the critical
sentence, or "No" (`Z' key) if it did not match, as quickly and
as accurately as possible.
As it was mentioned, RLs were recorded at three different
points: (1) from the onset of the fixation cross after listening to
the establishing sentences to the onset of the spacebar key press
(baseline RL); (2) from the onset of the fixation cross after listening to the critical sentence to the onset of the spacebar key press
(target word RL); and (3) from the onset of the question mark to
the onset of the `"Yes/No" response to the comprehension sentence (sentence RL) (see Table 1). Accordingly, to assess comprehension monitoring, we calculated a "pure target word RL" index
by dividing the target word RL by the baseline RL, whereas revision was evaluated by a "pure sentence RL" index, which was
extracted by dividing the sentence RL by the baseline RL. These
indexes avoided any influence from RL speed. Finally, accuracy

Items can be accessed in the supplementary material of Perez et al. (2020). They
include four practice items (one per condition) and items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 16,

48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60. Since the original (Perez et al., 2016) and multimodal
(Perez et al., 2020) studies were both carried out in the United Kingdom, the content
of each narrative text was evaluated so that only the 40 texts most culturally appropriate
and applicable to the South Africa context were retained. For instance, a text was excluded
if it referred to the monarchy or snowfall - concepts South Africans may be less
familiar with.

scores were also recorded in the comprehension sentence, as a
second measure of revision.

The flanker task from the Attention Network Task was used to
assess the executive function of IC (Fan, McCandliss, Sommer,
Raz & Posner, 2002). In this task, five horizontal arrows are presented, and participants need to indicate the direction of the central arrow (left or right). Surrounding arrows can either point in
the same (congruent condition) or opposite (incongruent condition) direction compared to the central arrow. Twenty-four practice trials followed by 288 main trials were presented over three
blocks (96 trials per block, presented in a counterbalanced
order with four cue conditions by three target conditions).
Accuracy rate across the task was high and approaching ceiling
across all conditions (M = 96.31%; SD = 3.69). Incorrect trials
(3.69%) and extreme values under 200ms and over 1200ms
(2.50%) were removed. Reaction times (in milliseconds) were
recorded for each trial and averaged across each condition to calculate the conflict effect (mean RT incongruent - mean RT congruent flanker conditions; Ms = 699.40 (SD = 71.26) and 579.77
(SD = 70.18) for incongruent and congruent conditions, respectively). Higher conflict effect scores mean worse IC (i.e., inhibitory
cost), whereas the opposite is true for lower conflict effect scores.
The IC index was included in the final model to understand
whether individual differences in this measure explained differences in the monitoring and revision processes.
Control measures
To ensure we had a valid presentation of participants' ENGLISH
both self-assessed and objective measures were
used. The self-assessed measure was evaluated by means of the
Contextual Linguistic Profile Questionnaire (CLiP-Q), whereas
objective proficiency was evaluated with an expressive vocabulary
task, a verbal fluency task, and a reading comprehension task (see
descriptive statistics in Table 2).

comprehensive language profiling measure that captures participants' demographic information (e.g., age, gender), language
background (e.g., L1, L2), use (e.g., home, school), proficiency
(e.g., speaking, writing), and socio-economic status (SES), emphasising the importance of sociolinguistic context. It has been validated and used in the South African context (Wigdorowitz, Perez
& Tsimpli, 2022). As part of the CLiP-Q, participants evaluated
their English proficiency across the modalities of speaking, understanding, reading, and writing on a Likert scale from 1 (very low)
to 10 ( perfect). These scores were used as indicators of selfassessed English proficiency.
Expressive vocabulary
To test expressive vocabulary, we used the South African version
of the WAIS-IVSA Vocabulary subtest (Wechsler, 2008, 2014).
Participants were verbally and visually presented with a series of
30 words that increased in difficulty for which they were
instructed to provide oral definitions of each. Each definition
is awarded a score of 0, 1, or 2 (except for the first three
words, whose maximum scores are 1; range = 0-57). This scoring
system allows for easy discrimination between high-level and
superficial-level responses to the same item. Scores were
summed and converted to age-normed standard scores (M = 10,
SD = 3; range = 0-19), with higher scores indicating better
performance.
Verbal Fluency
The verbal fluency task assesses lexical retrieval efficiency, tapping
into both proficiency and varying levels of executive control
(Friesen, Luo, Luk & Bialystok, 2015). In our version, participants
were required to generate exemplars from two semantic categories: living (animals) and non-living (fruits), under a 30-second
time restriction per condition. One point was awarded for each
new and correct word and no points were given for repeated
words or if words did not belong to the specified category (e.g.,
carrot reported as a fruit). Summed scores for the combined categories were calculated.

Reading comprehension
Reading comprehension was assessed using the Adult Reading
Test (ART, second edition; Brooks, Everatt & Fidler, 2016).
Participants were presented with one practice and three main passages that increased in length and difficulty based on the Flesh
Kincaid grade levels - a readability formula assessing the approximate reading grade level of a text (Flesch, 1949; Kincaid,
Fishburne, Rogers & Chissom, 1975). After reading each main
passage, participants were asked 10 pre-specified comprehension
questions based on fact, memory, or inference to assess differing
levels of understanding and retention. Correct answers received a
score of 1 with a total comprehension score being the sum of all
questions (range = 0-30).4
Working memory
Working memory was tested by a 2-back task, which measures the
storage and updating of information (Kirchner, 1958; Mackworth,
1959). In this task, participants are required to monitor a
sequence of digits to determine whether the present digit is the
same as the digit that was presented n-digits back; in this case,
two digits back, or 2-back. Of a total of 60 digits presented in
the main trial, 20 met the 2-back criteria and required a `J' key
press, while 40 did not, requiring no button press, and were considered `false alarms'. Before the start of the main trials, participants were presented with 10 practice trials comprising three
`hits' and seven `false alarms'. A composite A' (A-prime) score
was calculated based on participants' hit rates and false alarm
rates, following the A scores outlined by Zhang and Mueller
(2005). A higher A' score is indicative of better working memory
performance, where participants have fewer misses and incorrect
key presses.
4
A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was run on all English proficiency measures.
Two components with eigenvalues > 1 emerged, with self-assessed proficiency loading as
one component and objective proficiency as a second component. No differences were
found between groups on either self-assessed, F(1, 45) = 2.06, p = .16,  2 = .04, or objective
proficiency, F(1, 45) = 2.73, p = .11,  2 = .06, but English proficiency scores were positively
correlated, r = .46, p < .001.

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

Socio-economic status
A composite SES score was captured from the CLiP-Q and calculated from an index of 12 household assets (0 = no, 0.5 = yes,
summed), annual household income (value range according to
tax brackets; 1 = less than R195,850 to 6 = R708,311 and above),
and maternal and paternal level of education (1 = primary school
to 6 = Master's or higher). Participants' type of primary and secondary school was used as an additional indicator of SES (1 = government township/rural school, 2 = government suburban school,
3 = private school, summed across primary and secondary schooling; range 2-6).5
Procedure
Students who volunteered to participate completed the CLiP-Q
online prior to attending the experimental session.
Experimental sessions were carried out at a university with a
researcher and one participant at a time. Each session lasted
between one-to-two hours and took place in one sitting with
regular breaks. The verbal fluency task was audio recorded and
subsequently transcribed, the 2-back, ANT, and AMDT tasks
were completed on PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007), and the
WAIS-IVSA vocabulary subtest and ART-2 were manually
recorded using scoring templates from the assessment manuals.
The order of assessments was counterbalanced across one of
four conditions where each participant completed the next consecutive order. To ensure uniformity, however, all participants
began the session with the verbal fluency task and the fourth
task was always the vocabulary subtest. Participants gave their
informed consent prior to completing the CLiP-Q online and
again before testing, and received monetary compensation.
Data analyses
Initial analyses to assess normality and control for confounds
were carried out. Using ANOVAs, we compared the continuous
scores of each background measure across language group (see
Table 2). No differences were found in any of the self-assessed
English proficiency measures, the objective English proficiency
measures, and working memory (all ps > .05), suggesting that
the groups were comparable in these abilities. However, both
SES measures presented differences between groups, where the
L1-English group had a higher SES score than the L1-Zulu
group. Unfortunately, these SES differences are reflective of the
inherent inequality between the two sample groups that were
selected from South Africa (Cornwell & Inder, 2008;
Leibbrandt, Finn & Woolard, 2012), and therefore, SES cannot
be teased apart from the statistical analyses.6
For the RL analyses, only accurate data was used. Furthermore,
outliers were identified using the boxplot function, where data
points are considered outliers if they lie outside 1.5 times the
interquartile range above the upper quartile and below the
lower quartile (Becker, Chambers & Wilks, 1988). A total of 92
(5.86%) outliers were removed from the pure target word RL
index (monitoring process), and 134 (8.54%) outliers were
removed from the pure sentence RL index (revision process).
These two pure RL indexes were analysed through linear mixed
5
A PCA was also applied to the SES measures, where it was found that all indicators
loaded as one component (eigenvalue > 1). L1-English participants had a significantly
higher SES index score than L1-Zulu participants, F(1, 45) = 9.11, p < .01,  2 = .17.

When SES was added to the statistical models, the overall results remained the same.

effects models (LME) with the lmer function of the lme4 R package (Bates et al., 2021), whereas accuracy, as it is a binomial measure (0 or 1), was analysed through mixed-effects logistic
regression (MELR) models with the glmer function of the same
package. All models included Participants and Items as random
factors, and Condition (expected vs. unexpected for monitoring;
expected-congruent vs. expected-incongruent vs. unexpectedcongruent vs. unexpected-incongruent for revision), Group
(L1-English vs. L1-Zulu), and the centered values of IC, as the
fixed factors. Thus, the full fixed structure of each model was
always a three-way interaction (condition*group*IC) as well as
the combination of all its lower-level interactions and main
effects. Using the simr package (Green & MacLeod, 2016), we
ran power analyses with 1,000 simulations and alpha set at .05
to assess whether the sample size was sufficient to detect effects
in our models.
To determine the optimal structure for the random and fixed
components, we followed the procedure outlined by Zuur, Ieno,
Walker, Saveliev and Smith (2009). We first looked for the best
random structure using maximum likelihood, while the full
fixed structure (i.e., three-way interaction) was retained (Barr,
Levy, Scheepers & Tily, 2013). More specifically, the random
structure was tested by running an ANOVA between all possible
models containing the various combinations of intercepts and/
or slopes, using group and condition as random slopes, while
keeping the full fixed structure. The converging model that contained the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values was selected. Once
the best random structure was identified, we then tried to obtain
the best fixed structure. To do this, we ran stepwise model comparisons from the most complex model (i.e., three-way interaction) to the simplest model (i.e., main effects), by selecting
the significant  2 test for the log-likelihood, using maximum likelihood. Third, F and p values were provided by the ANOVA function of the lmerTest package using Satterthwaite's method and  2
and p values were provided by the ANOVA function of the car
package using Type II Wald chi-square tests (Fox et al., 2021).
To qualify the two-way interactions, the testInteractions function
of the phia package (De Rosario-Martinez, 2015) and emmeans
function of the emmeans package (Lenth, Buerkner, Herve,
Love, Riebl and Singmann, 2021) were used for post-hoc analyses
with Bonferroni correction.

Results
Our results are divided into two sections, depending on the
AMDT structure. First, we present the RL results obtained after
the presentation of the critical sentence containing the target
word (i.e., pure target word RL index), regarding the comprehension monitoring process. Subsequently, we present the two measures assessed in the comprehension sentence (i.e., pure
sentence RL index and accuracy), in relation to the revision
process. In this paper we focused on the fixed effects of the
models but summary details regarding model fit and random
effects of each model are provided in Appendix B, as well as
Pearson correlations between each variable in Appendix
C. Results of the power analyses confirmed that the sample size
for each model had sufficient power: pure target word RL index
= 100% (CI = 99.63-100%), pure sentence RL index = 88.90%
(CI = 86.79-90.78%), and accuracy = 100% (CI = 99.63, 100%)
(Brysbaert, 2019).

Target word in the text: Monitoring process
An LME model with Participants and Items as the random factors, and Condition (expected vs. unexpected), Group
(L1-English vs. L1-Zulu), and IC as the fixed factors, was run
on the pure target word RL index. A significant main effect of
condition emerged, F(1, 1437.76) = 83.26, p < .001, 2p = .05,
which showed that participants were faster to respond to expected
words (M = 1.17, SE = .03) compared to unexpected words (M =
1.43, SE = .03). A marginal effect of group was also found, F(1,
46.87) = 3.54, p = .07, 2p = .07, where L1-Zulu participants (M =
1.35, SE = .04) were marginally slower to respond to the critical
sentences than L1-English participants (M = 1.25, SE = .04).
More importantly, a two-way interaction of group x condition
emerged, F(1, 1437.76) = 9.32, p < .01, 2p = .01 (see Figure 1),
where post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference
between groups for the unexpected,  2(1) = 9.73, p < .01, but not
the expected condition,  2(1) = 0.01, p  1.00. Specifically, while
both groups were equally efficient at responding to words in the
expected condition, L1-Zulu participants were slower to respond
to the critical sentence than L1-English participants when this
sentence contained an unexpected word. No other effects were significant (all ps > .56). These findings suggest that while both groups
were equally efficient at comprehending coherent information, the
L1-Zulu group took longer to monitor inconsistent information in
English than the L1-English group, suggesting a less efficient monitoring process. In addition, none of the monitoring process effects
were qualified by individual differences in IC.
Comprehension sentence: Revision process
Pure sentence RL index
A second LME model with Participants and Items as the
random factors, and Condition (expected-congruent vs. expectedincongruent vs. unexpected-congruent vs. unexpected-incongruent
for revision), Group (L1-English vs. L1-Zulu), and IC as the fixed
factors, was performed on the pure sentence RL index. The main
effect of condition was significant, F(3, 1394.88) = 12.04, p < .001,
p 2 = .03, where post-hoc comparisons showed that the pure sentence RL index was higher on the unexpected-incongruent condition (M = 1.54, SE = .06) in comparison to the other three
conditions: (a) expected-congruent (M = 1.23, SE = .06), t(1405)
= -5.30, p < .001, (b) expected-incongruent (M = 1.22, SE = .06),
t(1410) = -5.27, p < .001, and (c) unexpected-congruent (M = 1.33,

SE = .06), t(1410) = -3.66, p < .01. No other differences were
found between these conditions ( ps > .31). A main effect of
group also emerged, F(1, 46.11) = 13.85, p < .001, 2p = .23, where
L1-English participants (M = 1.22, SE = .06) were significantly
faster to respond to the comprehension sentences than L1-Zulu
participants (M = 1.43, SE = .06). A third main effect of IC
emerged, F(1, 45.67) = 9.48, p < .01, 2p = .17, where participants
with higher conflict costs (i.e., lower IC) were faster to respond
to the comprehension sentences in general. In addition, the twoway interaction of group x condition was marginally significant,
F(3, 1395.88) = 2.46, p = .06, 2p = .01, and the interaction of condition x IC was significant, F(3, 1390.83) = 2.84, p < .05, 2p = .01.
No other interactions were significant (all ps > .17).
Post-hoc comparisons in the interaction of group and condition revealed that compared to the L1-English group, the
L1-Zulu group took longer to respond to the comprehension
sentences when presented with incongruent information:
expected-incongruent, t(185) = -3.15, p < .05, and unexpectedincongruent, t(230) = -3.72, p < .01, conditions; but this did not
happen when information was congruent: expected-congruent,
t(171) = -1.01, p = .97, and unexpected-congruent, t(187) = -2.40,
p = .25, conditions, where L1-Zulu participants responded more
similarly to the L1-English group (see Figure 2). Therefore, as it
occurred in the monitoring process, our results indicate that the
two groups did not differ when the story was completely coherent
(i.e., expected-congruent), and they had to confirm the information in the comprehension sentence (i.e., unexpected-congruent).
In contrast, L1-Zulu participants were less efficient than
L1-English participants when the comprehension sentence
required the disconfirmation of the presented information (i.e.,
expected-incongruent and unexpected-incongruent) as well as
when it demanded revision of the initial interpretation followed
by content that did not align with the unexpected information
(i.e., unexpected-incongruent).
Moreover, pairwise comparisons in the interaction of condition and inhibitory control showed significant differences between
the regression slopes of the four conditions,  2(3) = 8.52, p < .05,
where participants with higher inhibitory cost (lower IC) took
longer in the unexpected-incongruent condition compared to
the other three conditions. In contrast, participants with lower
inhibitory cost (higher IC) showed no differences between conditions (see Figure 3).
Accuracy
An MELR model with Participants and Items as the random factors, and Condition (expected-congruent vs. expected-incongruent vs. unexpected-congruent vs. unexpected-incongruent for
revision), Group (L1-English vs. L1-Zulu), and IC as the fixed factors, was run on accuracy to the comprehension sentence. Similar
to the previous measure, a significant main effect of condition
emerged, F(3, 66.47) = 22.16, p < .001, where post-hoc comparisons showed lower accuracy on the unexpected-incongruent condition, (M = .72, SE = .11), compared to the other three
conditions: (a) expected-congruent, (M = .91, SE = .16), z = 7.10,
p < .001, (b) expected-incongruent, (M = .86, SE = .14), z = 5.22,
p < .001, and (c) unexpected-congruent, (M = .87, SE = .14), z =
5.53, p < .001. There was also a significant main effect of group,
F(1, 5.78) = 5.78, p < .01, with higher accuracy scores for
L1-English participants (M = .86, SE = .09) compared to L1-Zulu
participants (M = .81, SE = .09). No other conditions or interactions were significant ( ps > .19). Therefore, all participants performed worst in the most difficult revision condition (i.e.,

Monitoring in high-level listening comprehension

Discussion
This study is the first to evaluate high-level listening comprehension in young South African adults with advanced proficiency in
English - the language of tertiary education and the country's lingua franca - but who have differing L1s that either match
(English) or differ from (Zulu) the language of the listening comprehension task. Our first goal was to understand how these
groups monitor and revise inferential information while listening
to narrative stories. We were additionally interested in exploring

The comprehension monitoring process was evaluated by manipulating the expectancy of the target word presented in the critical
sentence, which either aligned (expected) or misaligned (unexpected) but was still plausible with the generated inference made
from the establishing context. Accordingly, the pure target word
RL index for the critical sentence was used to evaluate whether
comprehenders had generated the knowledge-based inference
facilitated by the establishing context, and subsequently detected
a mismatch between this prediction and the unexpected word.

874

Previous studies on comprehension monitoring within both
the reading modality and auditory-verbal and visual-pictorial
modality at the sentence and discourse level have demonstrated
a general expectancy effect (Baker, 1989; Hu & Jiang, 2011;
Perez et al., 2016, 2019, 2020; Vorstius, Radach, Mayer &
Lonigan, 2013). In line with these findings, increased RLs in the
unexpected compared to the expected condition confirmed that
our participants had generated an initial inference and were
able to monitor their comprehension across the auditory modality
(confirming Hypothesis 1). This suggests that the initial inference
generated from the establishing sentence was more likely to be
activated in the situation model than the alternative interpretation
when participants encountered the target word in the critical sentence. Notably, these results also indicate that a similar comprehension monitoring process is evident across various forms of
content presentation, whereby the ability to monitor inferential
information across different modalities is efficient and largely
modality independent.
Importantly, we also observed that L1 background played a
role in comprehension monitoring efficiency when there was prediction interference. As predicted (Hypothesis 2), L1-Zulu participants were slower to process sentences containing the
unexpected word compared to L1-English participants, while
there were no group differences in the expected condition.
Thus, monitoring was less efficient for comprehenders who,
although highly proficient, had a different L1 to that of the task
when there was misalignment between the target word in relation
to the previously presented content. A similar reading time effect
was observed in an English monolingual sample with a slightly
different paradigm involving three conditions evaluating comprehension monitoring (a neutral condition, which contained general
information following the establishing content; a no-revise condition, which was similar to the expected condition containing a
likely concept; and a revise condition, which contained an unexpected but plausible concept) (Perez, Cain, Castellanos & Bajo,
2015). Similar results have also been found in behavioural and
electrophysiological studies evaluating comprehension monitoring, where highly proficient L2 speakers are less sensitive to
upcoming content and do not anticipate information to the
same extent compared to L1 speakers, likely because more time
is required to deal with unexpected information in a nonfoundational language (Chambers & Cooke, 2009; Kaan,
Kirkham & Wijnen, 2016; Martin, Thierry, Kuipers, Boutonnet,
Foucart and Costa, 2013). This effect may be related to typological
differences between languages, though (Foucart, Martin, Moreno
& Costa, 2014).
Comparisons can further be drawn with acoustic studies
assessing monosyllabic word comprehension in the presence of
noise and/or reverberation interference. Monolinguals consistently outperform highly proficient L2-English bilinguals during
English speech perception in noise tasks, suggesting that meaning
extraction is compromised during speech signal detection in L2
listening (Rogers, Lister, Febo, Besing & Abrams, 2006; Shi,
2010; Tabri, Chacra & Pring, 2011). Importantly, these results
are not explained by proficiency but rather by participants' L1
background as it relates to the language of the task.
Comprehension monitoring may therefore draw on automatised
processing which may be harder to attain if content is not presented in the L1.
Earlier theories of sentence processing postulated that
non-L1 comprehenders have a Reduced Ability to Generate
Expectations (RAGE; Kaan, Dallas & Wijnen, 2010; Gruter,

Mandy Wigdorowitz, Ana I. Perez and Ianthi M. Tsimpli

Rohde & Shafer, 2014) and recent research suggests that the
mechanisms underlying sentence processing, and prediction in
particular, is comparable in L1 and L2 comprehenders, where
results should be explained in terms of individual differences
between groups (Kaan, 2014). Accordingly, there does appear to
be a processing advantage for individuals with an L1 that matches
the language of the task, even when all participants have advanced
proficiency, which is attributable to a heightened processing sensitivity to variation within the semantic context. Interestingly, 12
(54.5%) L1-Zulu participants reported English as being their most
proficient language. This result may too be a consequence of the
quantity and quality of English input and usage between the
groups, given that L1-English participants reported to use
English with a variety of interlocutors (e.g., family, friends)
more so than L1-Zulu participants (see Appendix A). Further
research exploring questions of typological distance between languages as well as input and usage quantity and quality in multilingual contexts as it relates to the monitoring process in
listening comprehension should therefore be avenues of
exploration.
Revision in high-level listening comprehension
During successful comprehension of unfolding narratives, the
process of revision is required such that comprehenders need to
review the existing text interpretation and update their situation
model so that the new and potentially unexpected content can
become meaningfully integrated into the discourse context. This
process is cognitively demanding and largely dependent on the
proficiency and language experience of comprehenders
(Kendeou et al., 2013; Perez et al., 2015, 2016, 2020). Until
now, however, no study has investigated whether L1, as either corresponding with (English) or differing from (Zulu) the language
of the task, has an effect on the revision process under the condition that English proficiency for the whole sample is advanced.
Revision was assessed by combining the expectancy of the target
word presented in the critical sentence (expected vs. unexpected)
with the congruency of the critical information presented in the
comprehension sentence (congruent vs. incongruent), by means
of both the pure sentence RL index in and accuracy to the comprehension sentence. Crucially, revision was only required after
the presentation of the unexpected target word, to (dis)confirm
the comprehension sentence.
In line with the general predictions, we found that RLs were
higher (Hypothesis 3) and accuracy lower (Hypothesis 4) on the
unexpected-incongruent condition ("turtles"  "feathers") in
comparison to the other three conditions, with no differences
between them. These results indicate that participants were least
efficient when they were required to disconfirm information
that was coherent with their initial inference (e.g., "feathers" 
"ducks"). In fact, this was considered the most difficult revision
condition due to the need to be able to discard no longer probable
information. In contrast, participants were able to quickly and
accurately respond to information that was either coherent with
their initial interpretation or incoherent with this interpretation
but confirmed by the comprehension sentence.
Using the same paradigm but assessing reading comprehension, Perez et al. (2016) found that readers spent less time reading
congruent compared to incongruent sentences but only for narratives preceded by an expected (but not unexpected) concept.
Furthermore, when text containing an unexpected concept was
followed by a congruent (but not incongruent) sentence, readers

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

were slower to respond than when it contained an expected concept. Crucially, for listening comprehension, the only difference
found relates to the condition where incongruent content follows
an unexpected concept. While for reading comprehension, it
appears that prior context facilitates (or impedes) reading when
narrative consistency is maintained (or disrupted), for listening
comprehension, the effect is evinced only in the most difficult
revision condition involving an unexpected target concept followed by an incongruent comprehension sentence. This supports
the claim that revising content that is disconfirmed by one's initial
inference followed by a further iteration of incongruency is a cognitively taxing and difficult comprehension process.
Importantly, some research has found a prolonged influence of
initially encoded information from early parts of a narrative text,
such that the initial content exerts an effect on comprehension
even when newer content is qualified as the narrative unfolds
(Gueraud et al., 2005; Raap & Kendeou 2007), while other
research suggests that comprehenders can successfully amend
their knowledge to reflect new states of affairs that emerge over
the course of a narrative text (de Vega, 1995; Diakidoy,
Kendeou & Ioannides, 2003). Depending on the type and difficulty of conditions presented, both arguments hold.
Comprehenders are sufficiently able to modify earlier representations of a text with updated content, specifically when there is
only one disruption to coherence, but experience processing difficulties when listening to narratives that include prediction interference across two instances of coherence.
In terms of language differences, L1-English comprehenders
were significantly faster than L1-Zulu comprehenders to respond
to the comprehension sentence. Importantly, a two-way interaction of group x condition also emerged for RLs, where the
L1-Zulu group took longer to respond to the comprehension sentence than the L1-English group in the expected-incongruent
("ducks"  "shells"), and unexpected-incongruent ("turtles" 
"feathers") conditions, compared to the easiest expectedcongruent condition ("ducks"  "feathers", almost confirming
Hypothesis 5). The same was also predicted for the unexpectedcongruent condition ("turtles"  "shells"), but although means
suggested a similar RL trend, this effect was not significant
( p = .25). Overall, our findings indicate that non-L1 comprehenders experienced more difficulties than L1 speakers in dealing
with interference prediction, especially when the hardest revision
condition was involved during high-level listening comprehension. These results are consistent with Perez et al. (2019), who
found that participants were less efficient at revising their situation model during a reading comprehension task when it was
presented in their L2 compared to their L1, even though these
comprehenders were highly proficient in both languages.
For the accuracy analysis, general scores were relatively high,
with L1-English and L1-Zulu participants achieving accuracy
scores of 85.8% and 81.6%, respectively. However, L1-English
comprehenders were more accurate than L1-Zulu comprehenders, suggesting a more accurate inferential comprehension
once more in favour of L1-comprehenders (partially confirming
Hypothesis 6). Nonetheless, no interaction with condition
emerged, so these differences did not seem to be due to difficulties in the revision process.
A possible way to address these differences may be accounted
for in terms of metacognition - an awareness and evaluation
of one's own cognitive processes and thoughts (Flavell, 1979;
Fleming & Lau, 2014). Indeed, metacognition has been found
to be lower (Folke, Ouzia, Bright, De Martino & Filippi, 2016)

875

or equivalent (Filippi, Ceccolini, Periche-Tomas & Bright 2020)
in bilinguals compared to monolinguals. A preliminary interpretation of these findings proposes that self-evaluation of performance may be related to the language background of participants,
such that confidence is reduced in relation to the number of participants' spoken languages. Applied to this study, it is likely that
L1-Zulu participants were less confident in their judgement of
auditorily presented information tapping revision purely because
English is not their L1 and/or they are regularly exposed to
numerous languages, making them more sensitive to resolving
conflict and accepting inaccurate information. While the
L1-Zulu participants have the linguistic and cognitive resources
to deal with prediction interference, and indeed perform remarkably well on other language tasks and reading comprehension (see
Table 2), they may be less assured in their interpretation of auditory content, specifically when it is complex and requires the cancellation or questioning of previously generated knowledge and/or
inferences. While metacognition was not directly assessed in this
study, it is worth exploring its influence in future research to shed
light on the effect of self-awareness on non-L1 comprehension
processing, given that our interpretation is speculative.
Inhibitory control in high-level listening comprehension
As a second goal, we explored whether high-level comprehension
processes were modulated by individual differences in IC.
Sentence processing as explained by language differences may
be accounted for by processing loads during L2 comprehension,
such that when information is processed in a non-L1
language, it requires additional cognitive resources and may be
processed at a lower, usually lexical level, leaving fewer resources
for conceptual/semantic processing (Frey, 2005; Perfetti, Yang &
Schmalhofer, 2008). Comparably, the process of revising outdated
inferential content has been found to involve IC, whereby irrelevant information is efficiently disregarded while pertinent information is at the forefront of one's focus (Perez et al., 2016).
This may be borne out during high-level listening comprehension
where great inhibitory capacity is required to efficiently process
ongoing content, especially for non-L1 comprehenders. As such,
IC was evaluated as a factor modulating listening comprehension
performance for L1-English and L1-Zulu groups.
As expected, individual differences of IC were not associated
with the comprehension monitoring process (Hypothesis 7).
This lack of effect is consistent with previous studies showing
that text monitoring of knowledge-based predictive inferences is
a more passive process and not very cognitively demanding, especially in highly proficient individuals (Perez et al., 2015, 2016). In
contrast, IC was related to the revision process, suggesting that it
is more cognitively demanding than the monitoring process
(Perez et al., 2016, 2020). Accordingly, participants with lower
IC were faster at responding to comprehension sentences in general, but no differences in accuracy emerged. While not an
expected finding, it may be the case that participants with greater
IC were more deliberate and considered when responding to comprehension sentences, thereby being slower while still manifesting
an accurate interpretation. However, further research would be
necessary to clarify this general effect.
More importantly, IC also interacted with condition,
where participants with lower IC (i.e., high inhibitory cost) took
longer to respond to the most difficult condition (unexpectedincongruent) when they were required to revise their situation
model and replace their initial interpretation for a new one,

876

compared to the rest of the conditions. In contrast, this was not
the case for participants with higher IC, who took a similar
amount of time in all conditions (partially confirming
Hypothesis 8). These findings suggest that participants with
lower IC experience difficulties revising their situation model,
whereas higher IC participants perform comparably across conditions. Similarly, Perez et al. (2020) found that L1-English comprehenders with higher IC performed more accurately on
multimodal comprehension tapping the revision process, thereby
suggesting that participants with higher IC are better able to revise
their situation model when confronted with conflicting information across pictorial and verbal modalities.
Finally, we did not observe an effect of IC as a consequence of
L1-groups (disconfirming Hypothesis 9), suggesting that L1-Zulu
participants across the IC spectrum were comparable in processing efficiency and accuracy to L1-English participants when
answering comprehension sentences. There does not appear to
be a relationship between IC as it relates specifically to L1 background in highly proficient young adults. Rather, we found a general effect of IC across all participants, irrespective of their L1
background. A possible explanation may be linked to participants'
extensive quantity and high quality of English exposure and use
spanning a number of communicative contexts, coupled with
the fact that all participants could be classified as multilingual
to some degree and might therefore have enhanced executive control from regular language competition (Bialystok, Craik, Green &
Gollan, 2009). Notably, none of the participants were characterised as `typically' monolingual in the sense that they spoke
and had experience with only one language (see Appendix A).
For instance, of the 10 participants who self-reported as monolingual, they indicated that they spoke between two to five languages
(M = 3.40, SD = .84) and could write in one to three of these (M =
2.30, SD = .67), suggesting that this group actively uses more than
one language. It has also been well established that an individual's
languages are concurrently active irrespective of whether only one
is being used at any given time (Kroll, Bobb, Misra & Guo, 2008;
Wu & Thierry, 2010). Accordingly, suppression of non-target
language(s) is a regular cognitive activity for bi/multilinguals,
which is thought to enhance executive function beyond the domain
of language (Abutalebi & Green, 2007; Stocco, Yamasaki, Natalenko
& Prat, 2014). Such cognitive control may be heightened in individuals living in highly linguistically diverse contexts such as South
Africa, explaining why we did not observe group differences in
IC. In future studies, it would be beneficial to evaluate the role of
other (continuous) language factors, such as dominance, English
age-of-acquisition, degree of exposure to languages within the ambient context and so forth, since some of these factors have been
found to be determinants of executive control and/or comprehension ability in multilingual South Africans (Espi-Sanchis &
Cockcroft, 2021; Cockcroft, Wigdorowitz & Liversagem, 2019;
Palane & Howie, 2020).
Conclusion
Our results confirm an effect of L1 on listening comprehension,
where L1-English participants were more efficient and accurate
at performing high-level comprehension processes than L1-Zulu
participants. Most strikingly is that the participants' L1 appears
to supersede their advanced English proficiency on highly complex listening comprehension involving revision. Having an L1
that is the same as the task being assessed is facilitative to comprehension performance, even when exposure to the task language is

Mandy Wigdorowitz, Ana I. Perez and Ianthi M. Tsimpli

substantial and proficiency is advanced. Furthermore, while
there are processing costs associated with comprehension in the
auditory modality of linguistically and cognitively demanding
information, these do not appear to correspond to costs in
other linguistic tasks or reading comprehension, indicating the
remarkable ability of learners with advanced English proficiency
but who have a different L1. Together, these results reinforce
the idea that comprehenders with an L1 similar or dissimilar to
that of the task language, but who have high proficiency in the
language of the task were faster at revising their situation model
when their initial interpretation had changed, because they were
better able to suppress the interference generated by their initial
prediction equally well. Since this study was conducted on
South African university students, the results may only be generalisable to similar linguistically diverse and highly educated
populations. Notwithstanding, given that proficiency is considered a primary predictor of comprehension and educational
outcomes more generally, this study further illuminates the picture by illustrating that L1 is also important to consider in
comprehension performance, especially in linguistically diverse
contexts.
