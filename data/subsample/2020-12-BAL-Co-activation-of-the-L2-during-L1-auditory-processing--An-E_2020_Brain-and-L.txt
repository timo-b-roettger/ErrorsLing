Several studies have shown that unbalanced bilinguals activate both of their languages simultaneously during L2
processing; however, evidence for L2 activation while participants are tested exclusively in their L1 has been
more tenuous. Here, we investigate whether bilingual participants implicitly activate the label for a picture in
their two languages, and whether labels activated in L2 can prime activation of cross-linguistically related L1
lexical targets. We tested highly proficient early Spanish-Basque bilinguals on an ERP cross-modal priming task
conducted only in their L1, Spanish. Participants activated prime picture labels in both Spanish and Basque.
More importantly, participants activated Basque translations of Spanish auditory targets, even in a Spanish
experimental environment with no reference to Basque. Results provide strong evidence for non-selective bilingual lexical access, showing co-activation extending to lexical levels beyond phonological overlap. Our results
add to the growing body of evidence for the interconnective nature of bilingual language activation.

1. Introduction
A central question in the study of bilingualism has been whether
there is co-activation of a bilingual's languages when hearing, reading,
or speaking in one language alone. So, when a Spanish-Basque bilingual
hears the Spanish word perro "dog," will the Basque word for dog,
txakur, also be activated? Early accounts of bilingualism proposed the
equivalent of a mental switch that allowed the bilingual to turn off the
irrelevant language during speech processing or production (Penfield &
Roberts, 1959). It is by now a recognized phenomenon, however, that
bilinguals display concurrent activation of both languages, regardless of
whether they are reading, speaking, or listening to one language alone
(e.g., Colome, 2001; Costa, Miozzo, & Caramazza, 1999; Hermans,
2000; Macizo, Bajo, & Martin, 2010; Martin, Macizo, & Bajo, 2010;
Spivey & Marian, 1999).
Based on these results, recent accounts of bilingualism argue that
the cognitive architecture of the bilingual is fundamentally nonselective, but under certain circumstances operates selectively (Kroll,
Bobb, & Wodniecka, 2006; Martin, Molnar, & Carreiras, 2016; Molnar,


Ibanez-Molina, & Carreiras, 2015). The question now is no longer
whether co-activation can occur, but under what (experimental and
language) conditions it does or does not, and what levels of language
processing are typically affected. In the current study, we present evidence from an ERP experiment with highly proficient Spanish-Basque
bilinguals for language co-activation at the phono-lexical level. We
show that Basque language representations are co-activated at both the
phonological and the lexical level in a Spanish-only experimental environment, especially with regard to Basque translations and rhyme
words.
Recent calls in the literature (e.g., Wu & Thierry, 2010a) have emphasized that new work must pay particular attention to the context of
language processing, and especially situations that may inadvertently
engage both languages due to experimental requirements or broader
social context. In particular, one criticism of studies showing coactivation to the lexical level is that the methodological paradigm frequently requires the use of both languages (Costa et al., 1999; Guo &
Peng, 2006; Hermans, Bongaerts, de Bot, & Schreuder, 1998). Recent
studies have addressed this concern through experimental designs using

one language alone (e.g., Thierry & Wu, 2007; Wu & Thierry, 2010b),
but even these studies are open to criticism, as they have often tested
participants in their non-dominant language, which is thought to be
mediated through the dominant language until high levels of proficiency have been reached (Kroll & Stewart, 1994). In other words, it is
less surprising that the L1 would be active during L2 language use if the
L2 requires the L1 for processing in the first place. We argue that a
stronger case for language coactivation at the lexical level would be to
show coactivation of the L2 in highly proficient bilinguals in a situation
that only requires the L1 to be used.
Indeed, several past studies suggest that the non-dominant language
may be active in an L1-only context (e.g., Marian & Spivey, 2003a;
Spivey & Marian, 1999; Von Holzen & Mani, 2014), but crucially only

under conditions that induce bottom-up activation of the L2 (but see
Villameriel, Dias, Costello, & Carreiras, 2016, for evidence from hearing
bimodal bilinguals). Specifically, these previous experimental paradigms still required overt auditory input from the L1 to overlap with the
non-target L2 phonology. In the visual-world paradigm studies by
Marian and colleagues, participants saw four objects and heard instructions to pick up one of the objects. The spoken L1 name of the
target object (e.g., marka, Russian for "stamp") overlapped in phonology with the L2 label of one of the four objects presented in the
display (e.g., English "marker"). In Von Holzen and Mani (2014), participants saw a picture prime, followed by an auditorily presented
target word in the L1. In the critical condition, the auditory L1 label
(e.g., Kleid, German for "dress") rhymed with the L2 label of the picture

prime (e.g., English "slide"). In both of these paradigms that showed
activation of the non-dominant L2, participants physically heard an L1
target word that overlapped in phonology with the L2 picture label. It is
possible that activation of the non-dominant L2 label for the picture
prime is triggered by the overt presentation of the phonologically related L1 auditory target. These findings, therefore, limit the scope of
language co-activation to bottom-up acoustic/phonetic input from the
L1 target word and cannot speak to the automaticity of L2 activation in
the absence of overt L1 phonological overlap, as is the case in most realworld situations of L1 language processing (see Von Holzen & Mani,
2012, for similar investigations in children). Connectionist models such
as the Bilingual Language Interaction Network for Comprehension of
Speech (BLINCS; Shook & Marian, 2013) allow for extensive crosslanguage interactions within the bilingual lexicon, and yet experimental evidence to-date has not been able to substantiate the extent of
these possibilities (see also the Bilingual Interactive Activation Model of
Lexical Access, BIMOLA, Lewy & Grosjean, 2008, which allows for both
bottom-up and top-down spreading activation).
To address this question, we expand the scope of inquiry to further
investigate lexical-level L2 co-activation in the absence of overt phonological overlap between L1 and L2. In the present experiment, we use the
intermodal priming paradigm (Desroches, Newman, & Joanisse, 2009;
Von Holzen & Mani, 2014) to further test the limits of cross-language
activation and cascaded activation in a balanced bilingual population.
Similar to other recent EEG studies, we exploit a rhyming relationship
between primes and targets to investigate language co-activation (cf.,
Wu & Thierry, 2011; Desroches et al., 2009; Von Holzen & Mani, 2014).
However, to examine whether both languages are active at the lexical
level, we ask whether there is bilingual language co-activation in a
condition where there is no overt phonological overlap between prime
and target.

phonological overlap with the auditory presented Spanish target. If the
Basque prime image label influences the recognition of the target, we
anticipated a reduced mean N400 amplitude for this cross-language
prime-target rhyme pair relative to the unrelated prime-target pair.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
28 Spanish-Basque bilingual participants from the Basque region of
Spain (7 male, 21 female) participated in the study (M = 23.55 years,
SD = 5.04, Range = 19-36). Four additional participants were tested,
but were removed from analysis because they had too much noise in the
signal. All participants were right-handed and had no history of hearing
loss or neurological impairments. We were careful to recruit participants without referring to their bilingual status (e.g., Marian & Spivey,
2003b). Thus, participants were recruited through a central database
without mentioning their bilingual status or knowledge of Basque. To
be included in the database, participants had previously filled out a
short language history questionnaire adapted from other questionnaires
commonly used in the literature (e.g., Li, Sepanski, & Zhao, 2006;
Marian, Blumenfeld, & Kaushanskaya, 2007). Bilinguals were selected
by including their language profile in the search criteria. When potential participants were contacted to participate in the study, they
were only contacted in their L1 (Spanish), and no mention was made of
their L2 (Basque) or that the study was a bilingual language study. Prior
to the study, participants completed a picture naming task (BEST; De
Bruin, Carreiras, & Dunabeitia, 2017) and were interviewed by a native
Speaker of Spanish and Basque. Table 1 summarizes their language
background. Although highly proficient in both languages, participants
were clearly dominant in Spanish across the language background
measures. While they learned both languages before the age of three,
they learned their L1 Spanish earlier than their L2 Basque and also had
more daily exposure to Spanish than to Basque. They rated their L1 as
more proficient than their L2. They were also more accurate at naming
pictures in Spanish and were rated more proficient in Spanish interviews.

1.1. Predictions
In the present study, participants were presented with unlabeled
prime pictures, followed by an auditory target in the L1 Spanish while
they completed an unrelated picture matching task. We recorded participants' ERP response time-locked to the onset of the L1 Spanish auditory word targets. To investigate the level of language co-activation,
we manipulated the phonological overlap between the picture prime
label and the auditory target. Specifically, we created rhyming relationships between the prime label in Spanish (L1) or Basque (L2) and
the auditory Spanish target or its Basque translation. The relationship
between primes and targets was manipulated in five critical conditions
(see Fig. 1 for an illustration). To determine whether participants were
sensitive to the phonological overlap between prime label and auditory
target, we focused on the N400 component. The N400 is a negative
deflection in the ERP peaking 400 ms after the onset of a stimulus
sensitive to context or reduced processing of the stimulus. We anticipated that if participants were sensitive to our manipulations of the
relationship between primes and targets, the N400 component would
be reduced, indicating facilitated auditory recognition. Indeed, previous monolingual and bilingual studies have shown a reduced N400
for rhyme words in reading, picture naming, and cross-modal pictureauditory word paradigms (Barrett & Rugg, 1990; Desroches et al., 2009;
Grossi, Coch, Coffey-Corina, Holcomb, & Neville, 2001; Praamstra &
Stegeman, 1993; Von Holzen & Mani, 2014).
Of particular interest to us was the condition in which the Basque
label for the silently presented prime image rhymed with the Basque
translation of the Spanish auditory target. In other words, after seeing a
picture prime of a needle (Basque orratz), when balanced bilinguals
hear the Spanish auditory target lapiz ("pencil"), do they co-activate its
L2 Basque translation arkatz? We believed this condition would provide
the strongest test of the hypothesis that the L2 Basque was co-activated
during L1 Spanish processing as it would require co-activation of the L2
label for the silently presented picture prime in the absence of any overt

2.2. Stimuli and procedure
Stimuli consisted of 150 visual primes and 150 auditory targets.
Visual primes were familiar, imageable, nouns. Auditory targets were
always Spanish. A female native speaker of Spanish recorded all targets
(M length = 698 ms, Median length = 683 ms, Range = 436-1172).
Digital files were recorded at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and edited
post recording using Praat (Boersma, 2002) to remove clicks and silent
periods at onset and GoldWave digital audio editing software (GoldWave, Inc.) to reduce hiss and match volume. The prime-target pairs
were divided into five groups, 30 items in each group, to form five
conditions, described below. Note that the picture prime was always

presented as a silent picture prime and was never overtly labeled. To
illustrate relationships between picture primes and auditory targets, in
the examples that follow, SPANISH/BASQUE picture prime labels are
respectively presented in capital letters; Spanish auditory targets/
Basque translations are presented in lower case; rhyme relations, when
present, are underlined: (1) Identity: the Spanish label of the picture
prime was identical to the auditory target, (AJO/BARATXURI-ajo/
baratxuri) (2) L1prime-L2translation: the L1 Spanish label of the picture
prime rhymed with the L2 Basque translation of the auditory target,
(MANO/ESKU-aguila/arrano) (3) L2prime-L1target: the L2 Basque
label of the picture prime rhymed with the L1 Spanish auditory target,
(COCHE/BEREBIL-barril/upel) (4) L2prime-L2translation: the L2
Basque label of the picture prime rhymed with the L2 Basque translation of the auditory target, (AGUJA/ORRATZ-lapiz/arkatz) or (5) Unrelated: there was no relationship between the prime label in either
language and the auditory target (ALCACHOFA/ORBUTU-horno/labe).
Fig. 1 contains example stimuli from each condition. To control for
lexical properties of the stimuli, we compared log frequency, number of
letters, and number of syllables across conditions, languages, and presentation type (prime vs. target) and found no significant interactions
that could have potentially influenced our results (presentation
type * condition, presentation type * language, condition * language,
presentation type * condition * language, all Fs < 2, all ps > 0.3).
Separate univariate ANOVAs within each prime and target type
(Spanish labels of primes, Basque labels of primes, Spanish auditory
target, Basque translation of auditory target) showed no significant
differences in lexical properties across conditions (all Fs < 2, all
ps > 0.2). The auditory length of Spanish target words also did not
differ across conditions (F < 2, p > .2). We recorded ERPs to the
onset of Spanish auditory targets. Each participant was presented with
all 150 nouns.

convention. The EEG data were digitally re-referenced to an averaged
mastoid activity. Impedances were kept < 5 k, and EEG activity was
filtered on-line with a band pass between 0.01 Hz and 1000 Hz and refiltered off-line with a 20 Hz low-pass, 0.1 high-pass digital filter. Eyeblink and movement artifacts were automatically rejected using a
100 V amplitude cut-off across mastoid and eye electrodes. Epochs
ranged from -200 to 1000 ms after the onset of the auditory target
presentation. Baseline correction was performed in reference to prestimulus activity (-200 to 0 ms). Data were examined visually and
analyzed in 10 ms time windows from 0 to 1000 ms to establish the
locus of significant differences between conditions. Visual inspection of
the components revealed a general pattern of an initial negative peak
around 100 ms, followed by a positivity maximally peaking just before
200 ms, consistent with an N1-P2 complex. These components were
followed by a sustained negativity, although consistent with other
studies using a cross-modal paradigm, there was no clear delineation of
the components in the N400 complex (e.g., Desroches et al., 2009; Von
Holzen & Mani, 2014). Based on these observations and the known
onset of the N400 (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984), we focused on two time
windows, an earlier time window between 250 ms and 400 ms and a
later time window between 400 ms and 700 ms.
First, for purposes of data reduction, a selection of electrode locations was entered into data analysis, 18 electrodes divided into two
hemispheres and four regions: left frontal (F7, F3, FP1), left frontocentral (FC5, C3, FC1), left centro-parietal (T7, CP5, CP1), left parietaloccipital (P7, P3, O1), right frontal (FP2, F4, F8), right fronto-central
(FC2, C4, FC6), right centro-parietal (CP2, CP6, T8), and right parietaloccipital (O2, P4, P8). A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on
mean amplitudes with the factors hemisphere (2; left, right), region (4;
frontal, fronto-central, centro-parietal, parietal-occipital), and condition (5; Identity, L1prime-L2translation, L2prime-L1target, L2primeL2translation, Unrelated). See Fig. 3 for the electrode groupings. A
second repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on mean amplitudes
from the midline with the factors electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz) by condition (5;
Identity, L1prime-L2translation, L2prime-L1target, L2prime-L2translation, Unrelated). For both ANOVA analyses, only main effects of condition, and interactions with condition are reported and further investigated. Only significant t-test results for the four condition
comparisons are reported (identity vs. unrelated/L2prime-L1target vs.
unrelated/L1prime-L2translation vs. unrelated/L2prime-L2translation
vs. unrelated) following Von Holzen and Mani (2014). GreenhouseGeisser corrected p-values are reported where appropriate. Because of
the non-linguistic nature of the task, behavioral results are not reported
(e.g., Von Holzen & Mani, 2014).

2.3. Main experiment
During testing, we were careful not to focus participants' attention
on the linguistic nature of the experiment, and more specifically the
phonological overlap between words (see Von Holzen & Mani, 2014 for
a similar approach). Studies such as Wu and Thierry (2011) explicitly
asked participants to make rhyme judgments on word-pairs in one
language. In the present study, participants performed a non-linguistic
picture-matching task in order to mask the phonological relationship
between prime and target. By not biasing participant attention toward
the linguistic relationships between stimuli, we provide, yet again, a
more stringent measure of language co-activation.
Participants were seated in a quiet, dimly lit experimental room
facing a computer screen. All instructions, visual and verbal, were given
in Spanish. Stimuli were presented using Presentation Software
(Neurobehavioral Systems). A fixation sign began each trial, displayed
in the center of the screen for 1000 ms. Participants then saw the prime
image in the center of the screen for 500 ms. 50 ms after offset of the
prime image, participants heard the auditory target word. 1500 ms
after onset of the target word, participants saw a second image that was
either identical to or different from the prime image. The image was
displayed for 500 ms, followed by a blank screen for 1000 ms, during
which participants indicated via button press on a game controller
whether the second image was the same or different from the first
image. Fig. 2 shows a sample trial.
2.4. Electrophysiological recording and data analysis
Electrophysiological data were recorded using the BrainAmp DC
(Brain Products GmbH) system with Brain Recorder software. Data
were recorded with reference to the left mastoid at a sampling rate of
500 Hz from 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes placed according to the 10-20

time windows. In the 250-400 ms time window, a repeated measures
ANOVA with the factors hemisphere, region, and condition revealed
significant interactions between condition and hemisphere, F
(4,108) = 8.97, p < .001, np2 = 0.25, condition and region, F
(12,324) = 3.35, p = .009, np2 = 0.11, and condition, hemisphere,
and region, F(12,324) = 2.97, p = .014, np2 = 0.10. Following up on
this 3-way interaction, for the left hemisphere, there was a significant
condition by region interaction, F(12,324) = 2.92, p = .016,
np2 = 0.10. For the right hemisphere, there was a significant condition
by region interaction in the right hemisphere, F(12,324) = 3.69,
p = .006, np2 = 0.12. A repeated measures ANOVA over the midline
electrodes revealed no significant effect of condition, F(4,108) = 1.37,
p = .249, np2 = 0.05, or interaction between electrodes and condition,
F(8,216) = 2.13, p = .078, np2 = 0.07, precluding further analyses on
the midline in the early time window.
In the 400-700 ms time window, a repeated measures ANOVA with
the factors hemisphere, region, and condition revealed a significant
main effect of condition, F(4,108) = 3.01, p = .021, np2 = 0.10. The
interactions condition by region, F(12,324) = 4.83, p = .001,
np2 = 0.15, and condition by region by hemisphere, F(12,324) = 3.11,
p = .009, np2 = 0.10, were also significant. Following up on this 3-way
interaction, for the left hemisphere, there was a main effect for condition (F(4,108) = 2.52, p = .045, np2 = 0.09) and a significant condition by region interaction, F(12,324) = 6.07, p < .001, np2 = 0.18).
For the right hemisphere, there was a main effect for condition (F
(4,108) = 3.36, p = .012, np2 = 0.11) and a significant condition by
region interaction in the right hemisphere, F(12,324) = 3.41, p = .007,
np2 = 0.11. A repeated measures ANOVA over the midline electrodes
revealed a significant effect of condition, F(4,108) = 5.10, p = .002,
np2 = 0.16, and a significant interaction between electrodes and condition, F(8,216) = 4.49, p = .002, np2 = 0.14.

regions, t(27) = -2.50, p = .019, d = -0.67. Over midline electrodes, although the overall difference between L2prime-L1target and
Unrelated conditions was not significant, t(27) = -2.03, p = .052,
d = -0.54, the L2prime-L1target condition was significantly more
negative than the Unrelated condition on both Fz, t(27) = -2.43,

and auditory target or target translation. Consistent with the idea that
the target is processed easier when there is a complete match between
the label of the prime image and the heard target word, we found that
the amplitude in the Identity condition was significantly less negative
than the Unrelated condition during the 400-700 ms time window.
Furthermore, we found a similar difference between waveforms in the
L1prime-L2translation condition and the Unrelated condition limited to
the right parietal-occipital region, suggesting that the Basque translation of the Spanish auditory target was also activated during processing
of the Spanish auditory target.
In both the L2prime-L1target and L2prime-L2translation conditions,
we found significant differences in amplitude compared to the unrelated condition, but in the opposite direction and with a different
topographical distribution: Mean amplitudes in both the 250-400 and
400-700 ms time windows increased in these conditions compared to
the Unrelated condition (for other reversal effects in a similar time
window and distribution, see Chauncey, Holcomb, & Grainger, 2009;
De Cat, Klepousniotou, & Baayen, 2015; Midgley, Holcomb, & Grainger,
2009). We interpret these results as indicative of the fact that the
Basque label of the prime picture was co-activated along with the
Spanish label. The results for the L2prime-L2translation condition, the
condition of particular interest in our study, extends the findings from
the L2prime-L1target condition and suggests that the Basque translation
of the Spanish auditory target was also activated.

p = .015, d = -0.69, and right centro-parietal regions, t
(27) = -2.37, p = .025, d = -0.63. In the later time window

significantly increased in negativity compared to the Unrelated condition in the right frontal, t(27) = -2.27, p = .031, d = -0.61, right

electrodes, there were no significant differences between the L2primeL2 translation and unrelated conditions.
4. Discussion
In the present study, we considered the extent to which the nondominant language is active while processing the dominant language
alone. Using an intermodal priming paradigm, participants saw picture
primes followed by an auditory target in their L1 Spanish. We manipulated the extent of phonological overlap between the prime labels

Our results add to the growing body of evidence for the interconnective nature of bilingual language activation. Significantly, the
present results provide - for the first time - ERP evidence of co-activation of the L2 translation of the L1 auditory target word in the absence of overt phonological overlap between L1 and L2 targets. This is
an effect that has not been previously found when participants have
been tested in their L1 environment. We therefore provide the strongest
evidence yet for the non-selectivity of bilingual lexical access.
Our conclusion is driven by the results found in the L2primeL1target and L2prime-L2translation conditions in the N400 time
window. In particular, the L2prime-L1target results provide evidence of
bilinguals activating both Spanish and Basque labels for the silent
picture prime, especially when the subsequently presented Spanish
auditory target overlaps phonologically with the Basque label for the
picture prime. This finding supports other research suggesting that bilinguals activate the non-dominant L2 in an L1-only environment (e.g.,
Von Holzen & Mani, 2014). A potential caveat to this interpretation is
the possibility that activation of the Basque label for the picture prime
could have been primed by the subsequent presentation of the Spanish
auditory target (which rhymed with the Basque label). In other words,
would the Basque label of the picture prime have been activated in the
absence of such an overt phonological cue from the auditory target?
Given this possibility, the L2prime-L2translation results extend the

findings of the L2prime-L1target condition in a critical dimension.
Here, not only was there no overt presentation of the Basque label for
the picture prime (as in all other conditions) but there was also no overt
phonological overlap between the subsequently presented Spanish auditory target and the Basque label for the silently presented picture
prime. The selective modulation of ERP waveforms in this condition
relative to the unrelated condition, therefore, presents strong evidence
in support of the claim that bilinguals activated both the Basque label
for the silent picture prime and the Basque translation of the Spanish
auditory target, despite the Spanish dominant environment in which
testing took place and the absence of any cues as to the underlying
Basque overlap in the items presented. This finding speaks, therefore, to
the automaticity of co-activation of the other language during processing in one language.
Previous studies arguing for similar conclusions cannot rule out that
findings of co-activation were phonologically driven (i.e., required
bottom-up acoustic-phonetic input). The results of Ju and Luce (2004)
found effects of the L2 on L1 only when they manipulated L2 pronunciation to be more L1-like, in essence increasing phonological
overlap between the L2 and the L1, which would argue for phonological
effects of co-activation. Similarly, the results of Marian and Spivey
(2003; see also Spivey & Marian, 1999) and Von Holzen and Mani
showed activation of the L2 only when there was overt phonological

overlap between the L1 and the L2. In support of this possibility, we
note that Von Holzen and Mani (2014) found facilitatory priming effects, i.e., increased positivity to related primes relative to unrelated
primes, which are typically indicative of phonological effects, but not
lexical effects, at least in the behavioral literature (cf. Marslen-Wilson &
Zwitserlood, 1989). In contrast, by showing effects of language co-activation in the absence of overt phonological overlap, the present results strongly suggest that effects of co-activation extend to lexical levels and are not due to phonological overlap alone.
The idea that activation cascades from the phonological input to the
lexical item would be consistent with connectionist models such as the
Bilingual Language Interaction Network for Comprehension of Speech
(BLINCS; Shook & Marian, 2013). Indeed, our results provide the hereto
missing empirical support for the extensive interconnected nature of the
bilingual architecture as proposed by BLINCS. One of the few models to
specifically address auditory speech comprehension and bilingualism,
BLINCS comprises four interconnected self-organizing maps representing phonological, phono-lexical, ortho-lexical, and semantic
processing levels. The goal of BLINCS is to trace activation within the
lexicon over time. What makes this model so well suited to explaining
co-activation in the present study is that it does not require incremental
phonological activation focusing on word onset, but can also accommodate cross-language rhyme activation on the auditory target as in

our experiment (for monolingual contexts, see TRACE, McClelland &
Elman, 1986). The model also allows for the influence of visual stimuli
on auditory processing. This was incorporated to account for the Visual
World Paradigm, but can also accommodate cross-modal priming. In
essence, the model "increase[s] the resting activation of semantic representations for items that ... are currently visible" (Shook & Marian,
2013, p. 308). Their simulations show co-activation not just for phonologically overlapping words, but also for semantically related words:
The word road activated phonologically related ropa "clothes" in
Spanish, as well as the semantically related car in English. The results of
Shook and Marian (2013) argue for strong cross-language interactions
within the bilingual lexicon (and see Shook, 2014, for further evidence
of L2 language co-activation in an L1 setting using eye-tracking). In-line
with these findings, our study demonstrates the strength of cascaded
activation across languages (see also Chabal & Marian, 2015; Marian &
Spivey, 2003a, 2003b) and supports the view of a broad influence of the
L2 on the native language (e.g., Dussias, Perrotti, Brown, & Morales,
2014; Dussias & Sagarra, 2007; Kroll, Bobb, & Hoshino, 2014).
While our results provide striking evidence for language co-activation, they also demonstrate constraints to the extent of co-activation:
We found only limited effects in the N400 window for the L1primeL2translation condition. Why do we find a broader distribution of effects across target translations in the L2prime-L2translation condition
9

While the above explanation is tentative, this additional processing
step may also be causing a delay or continuation of earlier effects. Our
baseline comparison between the Identity and Unrelated condition also
showed a greater negativity for the Identity condition in the earlier time
window between 250 and 400 ms. Note that delays in the N400 for
bilinguals have been observed for semantic processing (e.g., Ardal,
Donald, Meuter, Muldrew, & Luce, 1990; Weber-Fox & Neville, 1996),
indicative of slower semantic integration. In view of the fact that participants completed a picture-matching task, the nature of our task is
arguably conceptually driven and may be vulnerable to these delays,
particularly in conditions where there is increased cross-language activation. The effect we document here then, especially for the Basque
prime label conditions, may not be a traditional N400 effect but may
rather reflect differences in L1 and L2 co-activation. This interpretation
would be consistent with findings that the scalp distribution of the effect varies across condition comparisons - found at frontal as well as
posterior sites and sometimes in one, sometimes in both, hemispheres
and not consistently along the mid-line. On the other hand, while the
overall effect sizes in the present study are relatively small, this could
be due to the experimental design. In contrast to the paradigm used by
Thierry and Wu, the participants in our study were intentionally directed away from the linguistic nature of the experiment by using a
picture judgement task. This may have reduced priming effects across
all conditions, leading to smaller effects.
In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that bilinguals
momentarily activate both languages while immersed in their L1. The
results of previous research indicated that the dominant language is
sufficiently automatic to obscure activation of the L2 during L1 processing. Here, using a more fine-grained measure of language processing, we show implicit access of the L2 translation, both at the prime
and the target, and even when the L2 is the language not in use and in
the absence of any overt phonological cues to L2 lexical activation. Our
results indicate that parallel language activation is pervasive, including
to the phono-lexical level, and future work will need to further clarify
the scope and contexts under which it manifests.

than in the L1prime-L2translation condition? We initially predicted that
an N400 effect would be more likely for the L1prime-L2translation
condition given that the experimental environment is Spanish, which
may provide more support for the activation of Spanish. One possible
explanation for the pattern of findings reported speaks to the strength of
connections within and across languages. In particular, given the
dominance of Spanish (L1), it is possible that the level of activation of
the Basque translation of the Spanish target from the Spanish prime is
reduced in the L1prime-L2translation condition. While there may be
similarly reduced activation to the Basque translation of the Spanish
target from the Spanish prime in the L2prime-L2translation condition,
activation in this condition is further influenced by the overlap within
one language (Basque) in this condition. In other words, the effect in
the L1prime-L2translation condition relies on cross-language overlap,
while this effect may be boosted by within-language overlap in the
L2prime-L2translation condition.
In instances where there is cross-language overlap, there may also
be increased competition between lexical items across languages, which
may also explain a reversal in the N400 effect that we find in the present study. The conditions most influenced by the L1 Spanish prime
label, the Identity and the L1prime-L2translation conditions, show the
anticipated reduction in the N400 effect compared to the Unrelated
condition during the later time window, consistent with lexical priming
paradigms (e.g., Kutas & Van Petten, 1988). However, for the two
conditions most influenced by the L2 Basque prime label, L2primeL2translation and L2prime-L1target conditions, we found an increase in
the N400 at both early and late time windows. Reversals have been
documented elsewhere in the bilingual literature, including priming
paradigms that require language translation. De Cat et al. (2015) found
a P400 effect in a primed visual lexical decision task at right frontal
sites for a group of German-English bilinguals. In another bilingual
study, Chauncey et al. (2009) also report a reversed priming effect
around 300 ms using masked priming and picture naming, which they
attribute to an interaction of effects between masked priming and
processing conflicts arising from translating the L2 prime into the L1
(see also Midgley et al., 2009). In our own case, it is the conditions
mediated by the Basque prime label (L2prime-L2translation and
L2prime-L1target), which show this reversal. While one possible explanation for the reversal targets the lexical competition that is incurred
in this case, due to the co-activation of the Spanish and Basque rhyming
words, an alternative possibility may be that the reversal may have to
do with how the auditory target activates the non-dominant language
(Basque) of the prime in an L1-only context (Spanish). Thus, rather than
the prime image automatically co-activating the labels in both languages, the possibility remains that the Basque label may only be coactivated in a second step, after the Spanish auditory target has been
heard and co-activated its Basque translation and/or rhyme.
