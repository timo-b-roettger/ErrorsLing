Access to an object's name requires the retrieval of an arbitrary association between it's identity and a
word-label. The hippocampus is essential in retrieving arbitrary associations, and thus could be involved
in retrieving the link between an object and its name. To test this hypothesis we recorded the iEEG signal
from epileptic patients, directly implanted in the hippocampus, while they performed a picture naming
task. High-frequency broadband gamma (50-150 Hz) responses were computed as an index of population-level spiking activity. Our results show, for the first time, single-trial hippocampal dynamics
between visual confrontation and naming. Remarkably, the latency of the hippocampal response predicts
naming latency, while inefficient hippocampal activation is associated with ``tip-of-the-tongue'' states
(a failure to retrieve the name of a recognized object) suggesting that the hippocampus is an active
component of the naming network and that its dynamics are closely related to efficient word production.

1. Introduction
A core aspect of our ability to speak lies in the process of word
retrieval, during which our brain establishes a link between an idea
or a concept (``a particular fragrant flower from a prickly bush'')
and the corresponding linguistic form (``rose''). Usually, there is
no natural motivation why a particular word form has been
attached to a particular concept, and hence this link has been
described as arbitrary (de Saussure, 1916; see also Shakespeare,
1599; some limits to the arbitrariness of the sign are discussed
by Marchand, 2010). For a speaker that knows a given word, the
arbitrary link is presumably stored in memory and retrieved when
the word is to be produced (for example, during visual object naming: Glaser, 1992).
In models of memory and language production, the retrieval of
arbitrary links is construed rather differently. In memory models,
some have proposed that formation and retrieval of arbitrary

associations, also known as relational memory, is a critical function
of the hippocampus (Diana, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2007;
Eichenbaum, 2004; Konkel & Cohen, 2009; Mayes, Montaldi, &
Migo, 2007; Moses & Ryan, 2006), and one of the basic mechanisms
that could account for its involvement in a variety of mnesic
processes (Ludowig et al., 2008; Manning, Sperling, Sharan,
Rosenberg, & Kahana, 2012; Rutishauser, Schuman, & Mamelak,
2008; Sederberg et al., 2007; Zeineh, Engel, Thompson, &
Bookheimer, 2003). For instance, hippocampal activity subserves
the successful association between an item and its paired-associate
or between an item and its context (Brasted, Bussey, Murray, &
Wise, 2003; Henke, Weber, Kneifel, Wieser, & Buck, 1999;
Petrides, 1985; Preston, Shrager, Dudkovic, & Gabrieli, 2004;
Ranganath, Cohen, Dam, & D'Esposito, 2004; Wirth et al., 2003).
In models of word production, the arbitrary link between meanings
and word forms is captured by the distinction between the semantic and the lexical levels of representation (Caramazza, 1997; Dell,
Schwartz, Martin, Saffran, & Gagnon, 1997; Levelt, Roelofs, &
Meyer, 1999). In the neurocognitive versions of these models, such
levels of processing have been tied to a distributed large scale
`language network' comprising frontal and temporal cortices. In
particular, semantic processes engage the temporal pole, the
medial temporal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and the superior and

C.M. Hamame et al. / Brain & Language 135 (2014) 104-114

inferior frontal gyri, while word retrieval primarily engages the
inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and posterior/lateral
and ventral inferior temporal gyrus (e.g. DeLeon et al., 2007; Vidal
et al., 2012, for reviews see: Binder, Desai, Graves, & Conant, 2009;
Indefrey, 2011; Price, 2012). In contrast to memory models, the
description of word retrieval processes do not usually consider
the hippocampal formation as an important node of the network,
at least not beyond semantics. For instance, the speech production
section of the most recent neuroimaging meta-analysis states:
``When word retrieval became more semantically demanding
(. . .) activation (. . .) was also reported in (. . .) the left hippocampus.
However, these anatomically distributed brain areas are likely to
reflect silent conceptual processing (see Speech comprehension
section) rather than word retrieval per se'' (Price, 2012, p. 829).
Indeed, only a handful of neuroimaging studies have reported
significant hippocampal activity during language production tasks
(Bonelli et al., 2011; Hocking, McMahon, & Zubicaray, 2008;
Pihlajamaki et al., 2000; Whitney et al., 2009).
The absence of the hippocampus in the language production
models described above might stem from two sources. On one hand,
imaging studies, which are able to accurately measure spatial
patterns of activation, lack the temporal resolution to describe its
fast dynamics. This means that a possible link between temporal
aspects of the hippocampal activity (e.g. latency) and behavior
(e.g. successful object naming), would be missed by conventional
imaging techniques. On the other hand, the clinical evidence
regarding a potential link between hippocampal damage and word
finding difficulties is somewhat mixed. First, patient HM, whose
prototypical medial temporal lobe (MTL) resection comprised both
hippocampi, had massive memory problems and a normal score in
most language comprehension and production tests (note however
that slight naming difficulties were also reported; Corkin, 1984).1
Second, more recent neuropsychological studies suggest that naming
capabilities can be compromised in hippocampal sclerosis (Bonelli
et al., 2011; Davies et al., 1998; Hamberger et al., 2007; Sawrie et al.,
2000) and after anteromedial resective surgery, but not in all cases.
The variable impact of MTL resection on naming performance has been
linked to the presence of pre-surgical sclerosis (Hamberger, Seidel,
Goodman, & McKhann, 2010; Seidenberg, Geary, & Hermann, 2005),
to different degrees of plasticity from spared structures (Sabsevitz
et al., 2003; Swanson, Sabsevitz, Hammeke, & Binder, 2007), and to
differences in neuropsychological assessment (Trebuchon-Da
Fonseca et al., 2009). Overall, the strongest predictor of naming decline
after MTL resection appears to be the absence of structural hippocampal pathology before surgery; post-operative naming difficulties are
likely if the resected hippocampus was structurally healthy before
surgery (see Ives-Deliperi & Butler, 2012, for a review). Together, this
evidence suggests a possible role for structurally healthy hippocampus in naming, but it does not specify at which level of word
production it may participate (perceptual, semantic or lexical).
Here we report evidence that the left hippocampus is involved
in overt visual object naming, a task that is highly relevant for both
1
Language function in patient HM is a long-lived debate. Neuropsychological
testing showed mostly normal scores in both comprehension and production, with
the notable exception of verbal fluency, an impairment attributed to extra-surgical
factors (e.g. education level; Corkin, 1984). Interestingly, clinical examination and
more demanding language production tests (DeRenzi & Ferrari, 1978) showed slight
(yet significant) naming difficulties. Additionally, more detailed examination of H.M.'s
language production revealed a higher frequency of different types of errors,
particularly omission errors (Mackay, James, Hadley, & Fogler, 2011). Other aspects
of language such as the retrieval and production of verbal material (Mackay, Burke, &
Stewart, 1998) together with grammatical and figurative features of speech were also
found to be impaired (Mackay, Stewart, & Burke, 1998; MacKay, James, & Hadley,
2007; MacKay, James, Taylor, & Marian, 2007). However, since H.M. resection
comprised an important part of the medial and anterior temporal lobe (i.e. not only
the hippocampus), the link that can be established between hippocampal function
and language on the basis of this patient's performance remains unclear.

clinicians and researchers who want to test word production. We
took as a working model the current consensual view in which
word production can be divided in several sub-components
(Caramazza, 1997; Dell et al., 1997; Levelt et al., 1999): conceptual
processing, lexical retrieval, and response encoding processes (the
latter variably ranging from phonological and phonetic encoding to
articulatory programming and triggering). On the basis of memory
models, where hippocampal function is to establish and retrieve
arbitrary associations, (Diana et al., 2007; Eichenbaum, 2004;
Konkel & Cohen, 2009; Mayes et al., 2007; Moses & Ryan, 2006),
we expected that hippocampal activity should be involved in
retrieving the link between semantic and lexico-phonological
knowledge (i.e. between a concept and its name).
Picture naming, which we used as the main experimental protocol, is arguably the most commonly used task to elicit word production processes in healthy and neurological populations (cf.
DeLeon et al., 2007; Glaser, 1992; Salmelin, Hari, & Lounasmaa,
1994). Here we analyzed behavioral measures of performance in
conjunction with neurophysiological activity recorded directly
from hippocampus. The behavioral measures of performance
included naming latencies, which are indicative of the whole production process (Alario et al., 2004), as well as certain errors that
are known to signal failures at specific stages of the naming process. In particular, we focused on those errors in which participants
correctly identify the presented object, but fail to retrieve its name,
a common situation known as `tip-of-the-tongue' (TOT) state
(Brown, 1991). This subjective state occurs frequently among
healthy (Brown, 2012) and neurological populations (TrebuchonDa Fonseca et al., 2009). It reflects a difficulty in accessing
linguistic information (Brown, 2012 p. 169), whereby successful
perceptual and semantic processing (recognizing an object) does
not lead to successful lexico-phonological access (retrieving its
name). This is a capital distinction in theories of word production
at least since Badecker, Miozzo, and Zanuttini (1995).
Neurophysiological activity was obtained with intracranial EEG
(iEEG) recordings, performed as pre-surgical investigation of
drug-resistant partial epilepsy. These recordings lack the full spatial
coverage of fMRI, but they benefit from high temporal and spatial
resolution. Therefore, they allow measuring electrophysiological
activity from a targeted neural structure in a time-scale meaningful
for single word production. Moreover, high-frequency components
of the iEEG signal (50-150 Hz) can be regarded as an index of
multi-unit spiking activity (Le Van Quyen et al., 2010; Manning,
Jacobs, Fried, & Kahana, 2009; Ray & Maunsell, 2011), providing a
robust tool for functional mapping (Crone, Sinai, & Korzeniewska,
2006; Jerbi et al., 2009; Lachaux, Axmacher, Mormann, Halgren, &
Crone, 2012), in real time (Hamame et al., 2012), and with no risks
of contamination from articulatory artifacts. Intracranial EEG
research has already advanced our understanding of languageproduction networks by clarifying the functional role of specific
brain areas depending on their temporal course of activity (Sahin,
Pinker, Cash, Schomer, & Halgren, 2009; Edwards et al., 2010;
Flinker et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012; Perrone-Bertolotti et al., 2012;
for review see: Llorens, Trebuchon-Da Fonseca, Lliegeois-Chauvel,
& Alario, 2011). Nevertheless, none of the cited iEEG studies included
patients with recording sites (depth-electrodes) directly implanted
in the hippocampus.

2.3. Behavioral analyses

Handness

The picture naming task involved a total of 230 different black
and white pictures of common objects, drawn from normalized
collections (Alario & Ferrand, 1999; Bonin, Peereman, Malardier,
Meot, & Chalard, 2003). Not all participants were tested with the
same number of pictures. Participants P2, P3, P4 performed a version of the naming task in which 108 pictures were presented in
three blocks comprising 36 different items each. P1 was tested
with the same protocol, but performed two additional (repeated)
blocks. Finally, participants P5 and P6 went through a later version
of the protocol with two blocks comprising 50 trials each (the same
50 pictures were presented twice; all other conditions remained
constant relative to the previous version of the protocol).
The stimuli were presented in the center of a computer screen
(6  6 size and 1000 ms duration) with a variable inter-stimulus
interval (1400-2100 ms). Participants were required to name each
picture fast and accurately. Voice responses were recorded with a
microphone (Audio Technica ATR20) positioned close to the participant's mouth.
A control task requiring visual processing but no linguistic
retrieval was also used with one patient (P1). In this standard face
categorization task, the stimuli consisted of 50 gray-scale photographs of human faces (6  6 size; 25 male, 25 female). They
were presented in the center of a computer screen for 400 ms with
a variable inter-stimulus interval of 3000-4700 ms. The participant
was required to classify the faces as male or female by pressing
manually one of two buttons. For all tasks, stimuli presentation
and response recording were controlled using E-Prime (Psychology
Software Tools, Pittsburgh, USA). All the tasks and recordings were
performed in a stable inter-ictal period, following a period of
twelve or more hours without seizures.

2.2. Stimuli and experimental procedures

Patient

stereotactically implanted with 5-11 multi-lead linear-array depthelectrodes comprising 10-15 contact sites (3 mm spaced, .8 mm
diameter; Alcis, Besancon, France), which allow recording the local
field potential (LFP) with millimetric spatial resolution. The targeted
structures had been selected strictly according to clinical criteria,
with no reference to the present study.
Among these patients, eight had electrodes implanted in the
head of left hippocampus. From those eight ``hippocampal''
patients, one had to be discarded due to poor task performance
(out of 108 trials, there were 40 correct responses, 5 incorrect
responses, and 63 omissions; mean latency was 1418 ms), and
another due to strong epileptiform activity. The remaining 6
patients were right-handed (Oldfield Questionnaire) native French
speakers (for clinical and neuropsychological data see Table 1). All
patients were left dominant for language. Hemispheric dominance
was assessed with (1) verb generation combined with fMRI;
(2) stimulation on recording sites during invasive recording and
(3) with the electro clinical correlation during seizure.
No hippocampal sclerosis or other structural abnormality
(tumors, vascular malformations or cerebral dysgenesis) was
observed in/from their MRIs. The absence of hippocampal sclerosis
was evaluated as follows: (1) no visual atrophy, (2) no signal
change neither in 3D fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery
sequences nor in T2-weighted sequence, and (3) no loss of hippocampal head digitations. Participants and their parents (required
for the two minor patients) provided written informed consent.
All procedures were performed in accordance with the University
Hospital of Marseille Institutional Review Board recommendations.

microphone. A response was considered to be correct when it
coincided with the name of the picture as established by normative
data (e.g., Alario & Ferrand, 1999). Omissions, i.e. trials where the
participant failed to provide a verbal answer during the response
period, were further investigated in order to distinguish recognition failures from instances where the participant recognized the
object, but failed to link it with a word-label (i.e. tip-of-the-tongue
states, or TOT). The distinction was based on the semantic and/or
linguistic information that the participant could provide regarding
the target (Miozzo & Caramazza, 1997; Vigliocco, Antonini, &
Garrett, 1997). After each block, the experimenter explored if
omissions corresponded to object identification failures or TOTs
by asking the following questions: (i) `Do you recognize object?';
(ii) `Can you explain the use of the object?'; (iii) `What is the
grammatical gender of the object's name?'; (iv) Could you provide
the beginning (first letter/phoneme) of the word?' Only trials in
which the participant could provide at least partially accurate
answers were considered as TOTs. The remaining omissions were
classified as `no recognition/unfamiliar object' and excluded from
further analysis.2 Note that this approach does not reveal neither
onset nor resolution of the TOT, but it serves to identify trials in which
it occurred and what was the corresponding hippocampal activity.
In the face-categorization protocol, response-time (RT) was
calculated from stimulus onset to button press. Only trials
including a correct response were considered in the behavioral
and neurophysiological analysis.
2.4. Intracranial EEG recordings
The iEEG signal was recorded with a 256 channel BrainAmp
amplifier system (Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany),
sampled at 1000 Hz and band-passed filtered between 0.16 and
200 Hz. During acquisition, recordings were referenced to a single
scalp-electrode located at Fz. For offline analyses, a bipolar montage (closest neighbor electrode reference) was chosen to increase
spatial resolution and to remove contamination common to
adjacent recording sites, such as the power-supply artifact. The
anatomical position of the electrodes was identified on the basis
of image-fusion using MedINRIA Software of (i) an axial scanner
image acquired before the removal of electrodes, and (ii) an MRI
scan performed after the removal of electrodes (Liegeois-Chauvel,
Musolino, Badier, Marquis, & Chauvel, 1994). MRIs were obtained
using a Siemens imaging system (1.5 Tesla). Contiguous serial
sections (N = 128; 1.3 mm thick) were recorded with a threedimensional gradient echo T1 (TE = 4 ms; TR = 10 ms) allowing
3D reconstruction (sagittal, horizontal, and coronal).
2.5. Time-frequency analysis
Time-frequency maps were computed using a standard Morlet
wavelet decomposition with a f0/sigmaf of 7 (Tallon-Baudry,
Bertrand, Delpuech, & Pernier, 1996), which helped us identify
which frequency components exhibited clear amplitude modulations (frequency range was from 2 to 160 Hz in steps of 5 Hz).
Time curves of band-limited power in high-frequency gamma
(50-150 Hz) were constructed as follows. Continuous data were
band-pass filtered between 50 and 150 Hz in steps of 10 Hz to
obtain 10 consecutive frequency bands. The envelope of each of
2
The standard definition of the TOT state is based on two facets : the absence of the
expected verbal response (omission) accompanied by the report of the actual
subjective experience (``I know what it is, but I cannot recollect its name''). An
alternative procedure would have been to interview the patient immediately after an
omission-trial rather than at the end of the block. However, this would have only
meant the interruption of the task at every omission, only a few minutes before the
end of the block, which would have given little additional certainty on the actual
occurrence of the TOT.

107

those band-pass filtered signals was calculated using the standard
Hilbert transform (Le Van Quyen et al., 2001). The amplitude from
each 10 Hz frequency-band was normalized as a percentage
change relative to the mean of a 400 to 100 ms pre-stimulus
baseline. The 10 envelopes were finally averaged across frequency-bands resulting in a single time-series for high-frequency
gamma (50-150 Hz). Performing 10 narrow-band baseline corrections instead of a single broadband one provides access to highfrequency dynamics otherwise obscured due to the power law
distribution followed by the frequency components of the iEEG
signal (Freeman & Zhai, 2009; Miller, 2010). Event-related modulations of gamma envelope were obtained by averaging its amplitude
across trials. In single trial data, an index of hippocampal activity
latency, the time-to-peak delay or peak latency, was defined as
the first time-point where the envelope of high-frequency gamma
reached its maximum value (peak) during the first 2000 ms after
stimulus presentation. Time-frequency maps were constructed
using ELAN-pack (Aguera, Jerbi, Caclin, & Bertrand, 2011). All other
spectral analyses, display and related statistical tests were performed using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) custom routines.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of hippocampal high-frequency gamma
responses was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests. For
stimulus-related activity, we compared across trials mean amplitude (computed between 100 and 1000 ms post-stimulus) against
the average amplitude of a pre-stimulus baseline ( 500 to
100 ms). The same was done for response-related activity
(500 ms to response against baseline). To evaluate if naming
latencies were dependent on hippocampal activity, the data of each
participant were sorted according to response time and then
binned and averaged in groups of five. Individual Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between hippocampus response
latency and naming speed across bins for each participant.
In the case of P1, the patient's motivation and the clinical setting made it possible to collect a larger amount of picture naming
trials (N = 180). From among those, we were able to confirm that
20 out of 34 omissions corresponded to TOT states. Since signalto-noise ratio of the high-frequency gamma activity is sufficiently
high to readily observe single-trial responses, we reasoned that 20
TOT trails could be sufficient for statistical hypothesis testing. In
order to correct for the largely unbalanced number of trials in
the two conditions (correct responses = 134; TOT = 20), we used
the jack-knife method for resampling the available data, and then
tested if there was an amplitude difference in the hippocampal
response. We randomly selected 999,000 data subsets of 20 correct
trials (from a total of 134) and ran 999,000 comparisons (Wilcoxon
signed-ranked test) between each of the resampled correctresponse subsets and the entire set of TOT-trials.
Finally, a single statistical model was conducted to examine the
cross-task differences observed in patient P1. We performed a
linear regression of high-frequency gamma peak-latency on RT
and task (picture naming vs semantic categorization).
3. Results
Single trial analysis of the iEEG signal revealed a sustained
stimulus-to-response hippocampal activity that was tightly related
to behavioral indexes, predicting both naming latency and TOT
occurrence. The details are as follows.
3.1. Behavior
All participants understood the picture naming task and were
able to follow the instructions properly. Incorrect responses were

108

C.M. Hamame et al. / Brain & Language 135 (2014) 104-114

relatively infrequent (Mean = 6.8%, SD = 7.2%, Table 2) and were
not considered for behavioral nor electrophysiological analysis.
Mean naming latency was 910 ms, SD = 122 ms (Table 2), which
falls in the range of healthy speakers for never-seen-before
pictures (cf. Bonin et al., 2003). After each block, the experimenters
interviewed the participant specifically about omissions, to clarify
whether they were due to a failure in recognizing the depicted
object or in retrieving its name, the latter were recorded as TOTs.
Since the task was relatively easy to perform, we recorded a small
number of omissions (Mean = 15, SD = 12) and an even smaller
number of TOTs for most patients (Table 2). Note that P1 went
through two extra blocks of the task and that variability in TOT rate
is normal among different patients (Trebuchon-Da Fonseca et al.,
2009). In order to ascertain that the results were reliably related
to naming and did not merely depend on perceptual or semantic
processing, we also analyzed data available from P1 performing a
categorization task (face gender). The participant understood the
task and did it properly with 2.1% of incorrect responses, 5 omissions,
and a mean RT of 701 ms (SD = 185 ms).

between picture presentation and naming is not specifically timelocked to the stimulus nor to the behavioral response (Mainy et al.,
2008; Ries, Janssen, Burle, & Alario, 2013). We could further confirm
this finding by assessing single-trial activity sorted by naming
latency. Fig. 2 shows how hippocampal activity increases after stimulus presentation and variably returns to baseline according to naming latency in all participants. In order to quantify the temporal
relationship between hippocampal response and behavior, we calculated individual correlation coefficients between naming latency and
hippocampal response peak-latency. Fig. 3 depicts scatter plots
obtained from hippocampal response latency in function of naming
latency. Correlations revealed a strong relationship of the two measures across all participants. In the case of P3, who had hippocampal
electrodes implanted bilaterally, we found no correlation between
naming latency and hippocampal response latency for the right
hemisphere (Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that hippocampal
involvement in picture naming might be lateralized.

3.3. Failure to activate the hippocampus and the tip-of-the-tongue
phenomenon

There was an increase in hippocampal high-frequency gamma
activity (50-150 Hz) in the period between picture presentation
and word production. In all participants, the increase in hippocampal
activity was clearly visible in the temporal profile of the envelope
(Fig. 1B) when averaging relative to stimulus presentation (P1:
z = 8, p < .0001; P2: z = 6.79, p < .0001; P3: z = 6.3, p < .0001; P4:
z = 4.2, p < .001; P5: z = 5.02, p < .0001; P6: z = 8.51, p < .0001). This
stimulus-related high-frequency response peaked around 500 ms
post-stimulus in all six subjects, however, it was followed by
decreases of slightly different slopes. This difference among participants could be attributed to differences in naming latencies. To
investigate if activity was also dependent on naming latency, and
not only on stimulus presentation, we computed the temporal profile of the high-frequency gamma envelope locked to the voice-key
response (Fig. 1C). Response-related activity was also significantly
higher than pre-stimulus baseline in all six participants (P1: z = 8.9,
p < .0001; P2: z = 7.26, p < .0001; P3: z = 5.83, p < .0001; P4:
z = 3.49, p < .005; P5: z = 4.66, p < .001; P6: z = 6.28, p < .0001),
suggesting that, indeed, hippocampal high-frequency activity

All six participants experienced TOT states in at least one trial
(Table 2), however only P1 (who went through 2 extra blocks of
the task) had a sample large enough to grant further analysis.
There, we found a significant difference in the amplitude of the
neural activity for correct responses compared to TOTs (z = 3.47,
p < .05) (Fig. 4). In fact, we could not observe any significant
response when comparing post-stimulus activity against pre-stimulus baseline during TOT trials (z = 1, p = .31). Notably, we found a
different pattern at another recording site of the same electrode,
located in the left collateral sulcus, in Perirhinal cortex, a region
toward the end of the ventral stream of visual object processing
(Goodale & Milner, 1992; Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982). There,
activity has been related to high-level aspects of visual object perception and recognition (Buckley & Gaffan, 2006). Analysis of highfrequency activity and that perirhinal site, revealed comparable
response amplitudes in correct and TOT trials (z = 1.47, p = .21)
(Fig. 4). Contrary to the observed left hippocampal activity, we
found no significant correlation between naming latency and
latency of the perirhinal response (Fig. 5).

The above findings suggest that left hippocampus activity
during naming is not solely related to visual object identification
processes, but also to linguistic (lexico-phonological) processes.
Further arguments for this interpretation come from the face categorization task performed by P1, in which gender recognition was
required but no naming was possible because the faces were
unknown. Although we found a small but significant hippocampal
response to faces (z = 1.93, p < .05), the time-course of single trial
hippocampal activity during the categorization task did not suggest
any relationship to behavior (Fig. 5); the hippocampal response
latency was not correlated with RTs (Pearson R = .12, p = .55).
The contrast between naming and categorization tasks in highfrequency activity dynamics was examined with a linear regression
of high-frequency gamma (peak) latency on RT and task. This
revealed a main effect of task (t = 2.54, p = .016) and an interaction
between task and RT (t = 2.80, p < .01). The interaction confirms a
significant difference between the correlations across tasks, where
the effect of RT is present in naming, but absent in categorization.

4. Discussion
Our experiment revealed, for the first time, the trial-by-trial
dynamics of hippocampal activity during visual object naming. In

all 6 participants, the left hippocampus showed a significant activity that was sustained between shortly after the stimulus presentation until the onset of overt word production. In addition, there
was a functional relationship between this hippocampal activity
and picture naming performance. Peak-latency of hippocampal
response consistently predicted naming latency, and failure to activate the hippocampus was associated with TOT states (object recognition with no lexical access). Contrasting with these findings in
naming, the hippocampal response detected in semantic categorization (gender classification of unknown faces) was not functionally related to behavioral performance.
According to the models of word production and memory
presented in the Introduction, visual and semantic processes are
engaged in the course of successful visual object naming, in
stumbling upon a TOT state in a naming task, and in semantic
categorization of a face. During naming, visual-semantic processes
are responsible for object identification which in turn leads into
lexical retrieval processes (Indefrey, 2011). During TOT states,
participants are able to activate the concept they want to
communicate, but fail to retrieve the corresponding word-form
(Brown, 1991). There are discussions about the exact nature of
the knowledge that fails to be retrieved (lexical vs phonological;
Badecker et al., 1995; Brown, 1991; Miozzo & Caramazza, 1997;
Vigliocco et al., 1997), but it is mostly admitted that TOT states

provide a strong argument for separating conceptual from linguistic processing (what the object is vs. what its name is).3 Finally,
during face categorization, visual-semantic processes allow identification of the presented stimulus as a human face with a particular
gender, even if the faces are unknown. In this context, the question
arises whether the hippocampal activation we report solely reflects
the engagement of such visual and semantic processes or whether
it also reflects linguistic (e.g. lexical-access) processing.
Below, we first discuss the evidence gathered from patient P1,
in the comparison of correct and TOT trials, as well as naming
and semantic categorization. We then discuss the functional relationship between hippocampal activity and naming performance
consistently observed across the six patients.
The patterns of hippocampal activity were quite distinct during
successful object naming compared to TOT and face categorization.
During successful naming, hippocampal activity was sustained
until around the behavioral response and its peak-latency was correlated with naming latency. During TOTs and face categorization,
the response was significantly smaller and, when present, it did not
correlate with response time (RT). This empirical distinction
between no word retrieval and successful word retrieval suggests
3
In his recent review, Brown (2012) favors this interpretation over the ``inferential
interpretation'', according to which TOT is thought to stem from a meta-memory
evaluation of the accessibility of information (see Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion
on this matter).

that the pattern of hippocampal activity during successful naming
is not solely related to visual object identification processes. Linguistic processes (e.g. at the lexico-phonological stage) must be
associated with this neural response.
From a neural perspective, is important to underline the perirhinal activity recorded during TOTs. The perirhinal cortex is a
brain area connecting the ventral stream of visual processing with
the MTL (Wixted & Squire, 2011) and is proposed to play a critical
role in higher-order crossmodal object perception and memory
(Saksida & Bussey, 2010; Taylor, Moss, Stamatakis, & Tyler,
2006). Contrary to what we observed in the hippocampus, the perirhinal response was not significantly different between TOT and
correct trials (Fig. 4). This comforts the view that TOTs were not
due to an attentional failure. In contrast, activity in perirhinal cortex strongly suggests that stimuli were processed to a considerable
extent into the ventral stream of visual processing, presumably up
to semantic identification (Chan et al., 2011).
From a processing perspective, the canonical description that
TOT reflects access to a concept and failure in accessing its name
would seem to be somewhat static. It is likely that, once they
notice their state, speakers engage into active word-finding strategies which differ from those engaged in standard efficient naming
(for an early proposal along those lines see Goodglass, Theurkauf,
& Wingfield, 1984). Those strategies might very well engage brain
networks different from those usually involved in efficient, errorless language production and long-term memory retrieval. Future

studies should further investigate the onset and/or resolution of
TOT states (as in Diaz, Lindin, Galdo-Alvarez, Facal, & Onesimo,
2007; Kikyo, Ohki, & Sekihara, 2001; Zuckerman, Levy, Tibon,

Reggev, & Maril, 2012), particularly whether it involves a latter
hippocampal activation and/or the recruitment of other neural circuits (as is probably the case in hippocampal sclerosis).

112

While these observations come from a single patient (we come
back to this point at the end of the Discussion), they do suggest
that the hippocampal activity observed during object naming
involves linguistic processes that occur beyond visuo-semantic
identification. This interpretation is further supported by the consistent functional link observed between hippocampal activity and
naming performance in all six patients. The peak-latency of the
hippocampal response is tightly correlated, on a trial to trial basis,
with naming latency (Fig. 2), yet we failed to find any such correlation regarding RT (button-press) for face categorization (Fig. 5).
The correlation was also absent in the one right hippocampus that
we could record from, in keeping with the general observation that
the structures in left hemisphere (of right-handers) play a more
prominent role in language processing than their right counterparts. Together, this pattern of significant vs absent correlations
strengthens the link between the hippocampal response in naming
and linguistic processes.
The interpretation of the hippocampal activity in visual object
naming as reflecting linguistic processing begs the question of its
functional significance. We recall at this point that the main experimental task (standard picture naming) did not require participants to memorize the items, only that they come up with the
most appropriate and correct name as fast as possible. As noted
in the Introduction, the hippocampus is relatively absent from
language production models, but it plays an important functional
role in memory models. The latter emphasize its role in establishing and retrieving arbitrary associations, particularly when linking
an item to its spatial and/or episodic context (Brasted et al., 2003;
Diana et al., 2007; Henke et al., 1999; Mayes et al., 2007; Petrides,
1985; Preston et al., 2004; Ranganath, Cohen, Dam, & D'Esposito,
2004; Wirth et al., 2003). Drawing on this model of hippocampal
function, we propose that binding an object with its name may
constitute an instance of associative memory. In addition to linking
two paired associates, or an item with its context, we propose
that the hippocampal response in picture naming helps establishing or retrieving the arbitrary association between an object and its
name (c.f. Badecker et al., 1995; de Saussure, 1916). In short,
hippocampal activity may link a particular item not only to its
spatial context (Polyn & Kahana, 2008; Polyn, Natu, Cohen, &
Norman, 2005; Sederberg et al., 2007), but also to a lexicophonological space, relating semantic and lexical aspects of the
processed visual object.
The associative function proposed for the hippocampus finds an
structural support in its pattern of widespread connectivity
through the neighboring MTL cortices. For example, in the case
of picture naming, where an object first needs to be visually
processed, hippocampal response is modulated by afferences from
entorhinal cortex receiving activity related to object information,
processed by the perirhinal cortex, at the tip of the ventral
(``what?'') stream and their spatio-temporal context processed by
the parahippocampal cortex, located toward the end of the dorsal
(``where?'') stream (Saksida & Bussey, 2010). The perirhinal cortex,
at the tip of the ventral stream, and the parahippocampal cortex
project to the entorhinal cortex which in turn projects directly onto
the hippocampus (cf. Wixted & Squire, 2011). Moreover, fMRI
graph analysis have revealed hippocampal functional connections
with the `associative-semantic network' and with cortical regions
of the ventral visual stream (Vandenberghe et al., 2012). Indeed
the two subsystems, the perisylvian network containing temporal
posterior and inferior frontal structures, and the ventral stream
network containing fusiform gyrus, perirhinal cortex and hippocampus, are connected through a unique link between left fusiform
gyrus and the posterior third of left middle temporal gyrus
(Vandenberghe et al., 2012). Interestingly those two `nodes' are
well-known to participate in lexical-access (Deleon et al., 2007;
Trebuchon-Da Fonseca et al., 2009).

Before concluding, we acknowledge that the main limitation of
our study is sample size and number of TOTs (six epilepsy patients
and only one with sufficient TOTs). Note however, that direct electrophysiological recordings of the left hippocampus in humans are
scarce. To the date, epilepsy patients are the only opportunity
researchers have to examine hippocampal electrophysiological
activity during cognitively motivated tasks such as picture naming.
Indeed, from a total sample of 28 recorded patients, only eight had
electrodes implanted in structurally healthy hippocampi (no signal
abnormality on MRI). From those eight, one was discarded due to
excessive epileptiform activity and another one due to poor task
performance. Moreover, since humans are experts in naming visual
objects, the picture naming task is relatively easy to perform; trials
where the participants recognized the object, but failed to retrieve
its name (TOT) were infrequent. Nevertheless, the functional relationship found between hippocampal response latency and naming
latency was strong and consistent among the six participants. In
the case of P1, where we could identify 20 TOTs, the contrast
between hippocampal activity in correct trials vs. TOT was very
clear, and converged with the observations made in the face categorization task on the basis of many more trials (100).

5. Conclusions
The data we report show that the left hippocampus is involved
in picture naming to the point that its response latency predicts
naming latency, and failure to activate it is associated with TOT
states. In contrast, we found no functional relationship between
hippocampal response and non-verbal categorization performance.
Overall, our results demonstrate a close link between left hippocampus activity and the association of a visual object to its name,
presumably involving linguistic processes (e.g. from the lexical or
later processing levels in language production models). We conclude that a critical hippocampal function during visual object
naming is to link visuo-semantic and lexical properties of a recognized visual object.
Clearly, the scope of the above conclusion is tightly related to
the main experimental task on which it is based, namely picture
naming. Note however that picture naming has arguably been,
and remains, the primary protocol to investigate basic process of
word production in healthy and neurological patients. It remains
to be tested in future research whether and how the hippocampus
plays a functional role in other word production situations, such as
spontaneous language production where the word to be uttered is
not prompted by a visual stimulus.
