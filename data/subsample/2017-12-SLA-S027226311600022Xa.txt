This study investigated the effectiveness of providing L1 explicit
information (EI) with practice for making more accurate and faster
interpretations of L2 French Imparfait (IMP). Two treatments were
investigated: (a) "L2-only," providing EI about the L2 with L2 interpretation practice, and (b) "L2+L1," providing the exact same L2-only
treatment and including EI about the L1 (English) with practice interpreting L1 features that are equivalent to the IMP. Fifty L2 French
learners were randomly assigned to either L2-only, L2+L1, or a control group. Online (self-paced reading) and offline (context-sentence
matching) measures from pretest, posttest, and delayed posttests
showed that providing additional L1 EI and practice improved not
only offline L2 accuracy, but also the speed of online L2 processing.
To our knowledge, this makes original and significant contributions
about the nature of EI with practice and the role of the L1 (Tolentino &
Tokowicz, 2014), and it extends a recent line of research examining
EI effects in online sentence processing (Andringa & Curcic, 2015).

The usefulness of providing L2 learners with explicit information (EI) about
a target feature and subsequent practice in processing the input is not fully
understood. As noted by Henry, Culman, and VanPatten (2009, p. 573) "not
all EI is the same, not all structures are the same, and the interaction of EI,
structure, and processing problem may yield different results in different
studies." The current study investigates the effects of EI with practice in
the L2 and, also, in light of research documenting persistent difficulty when
the L1 and L2 express the same meaning differently (Izquierdo & Collins,
2008; McManus, 2013, 2015; Roberts & Liszka, 2013), whether additional EI
about the L1 with L1 practice can help a specific processing problem--
interpreting the habitual versus ongoing meanings of L2 French Imparfait
(IMP) for L1 English learners. We tested whether making this conceptual
distinction explicit, through EI and meaning-based practice in both L1 and
L2, would aid form-meaning mapping. First, we briefly discuss research
into L2 EI and practice, before justifying the investigation of a role for L1 EI
and practice, and then move on to discuss why EI and practice (in L2 and
L1) may have an effect on online processing.
L2 EI AND PRACTICE
EI about the L2 is useful for learning, according to information processing
and skill acquisition theories, because some declarative information can
become proceduralized through practice and automatized, resulting in
automatized declarative knowledge and/or knowledge that appears
indistinguishable from implicit knowledge (DeKeyser, 2015). "Weaker"
accounts suggest that learners can use EI to segment or parse the input
(Terrell, 1991), notice features (Schmidt, 1990), understand a rule and help
production (Leow, 2015), and arrive at correct interpretations with fewer
practice items (Henry et al., 2009). The effectiveness of EI is likely to
depend on several factors, including its precise nature--the type of information conveyed and the feature in focus. There is a considerable body of
research into feature difficulty and amenability to different kinds of instruction (e.g., DeKeyser, 2012). VanPatten and Rothman (2015) suggest that features most likely to benefit might be those that must be learned directly
from the input, such as representations of inflectional verb morphology,
as EI may make them better noticed in the input. In addition, the selection
of which features could benefit from which kinds of EI and practice could
partially be informed by the nature of L1-L2 differences.
L1 EI AND PRACTICE
Long-term difficulties have been documented for learning L2 features that
share some similarity across the L1-L2, and yet have different form-meaning

L1 Explicit Instruction and L2 Online and Offline Performance

461

mappings (Murakami & Alexopoulou, 2016; Spada, Lightbown, & White,
2005). Yet, as Ellis and Shintani (2014, p. 247) noted, "there is almost
no research that has investigated the actual effects of the classroom
use of the L1 on L2 learning." A few classroom studies have shown that
raising learners' awareness about L1-L2 differences benefits learning
of L2 lexis (Laufer & Girsai, 2008; White & Horst, 2012) and grammar
(Horst, White, & Bell, 2010; Kupferberg, 1999; Spada et al., 2005), as
measured during the actual learning events or immediately afterward
through offline vocabulary and writing tests. Evidence also suggests
that providing EI about L1-L2 differences correlated positively with
learners' performance on untimed tests that allowed access to that
awareness, that is, grammaticality judgments and sentence construction tasks (Ammar, Lightbown, & Spada, 2010). One of the few intervention studies to address the amenability of L1-L2 differences to
instruction was conducted by Tolentino and Tokowicz (2014). Grammaticality judgment tests showed that providing EI, input flood, and
repetition practice of features that exist in both languages but are
realized differently did not in fact benefit from instruction (although
benefits were found for features unique to the L2). However, as that
study provided no EI about the L1 or any meaning-based practice, the
effectiveness of instruction for cross-linguistically different features
remains to be explored further.
To our knowledge, the current study addresses three significant
gaps in this agenda. First, learning has not yet been documented using
delayed posttests. Second, research has not yet investigated the benefits of systematic L1 practice as an intentional component of instruction.
Third, research has not yet examined the effects of L1 EI and practice on
online sentence processing, discussed next.
ONLINE EFFECTS OF EI AND PRACTICE
Studies showing benefits for EI with (or without) practice have almost
exclusively used offline tests that allow access to explicit knowledge,
with very little use of online measures (as noted by DeKeyser &
Prieto Botana, 2015; VanPatten & Rothman, 2015). Online measures
can provide "fine-grained information about moment-by-moment
sentence comprehension [. . . to] examine what happens at precise
points in a sentence" (Keating & Jegerski, 2015, p. 2). For example,
longer reaction times relative to comparison items may indicate a
processing cost brought about by ungrammaticality, ambiguity, or
complexity (Roberts, 2016). Some theorists argue for an even stronger, causal relation between online processing and learning (e.g.,
O'Grady, 2005, 2015; see Phillips & Ehrenhofer, 2015). That is, online
processing may be a mechanism by which learning is driven and

462

Kevin McManus and Emma Marsden

constrained and processing difficulty (e.g., complexity or cost) a key
factor in learning. To this end, VanPatten and Rothman (2015, p. 113)
recommended:
moving away from knowledge-testing more generally and more into the
interface between knowledge and processing via techniques such as . . .
self-paced listening/reading. . . . Currently, these are used largely to understand the processing outcomes of acquisition. We think they can be used
to study acquisition-as-processing itself.

To our knowledge, the relationship between online L2 processing
and explicit instruction has been investigated in two published
studies to date.1 First, Andringa and Curcic (2015) provided half their
participants with brief EI explaining that a preposition predicts the
animacy of the upcoming direct object in a novel language. Learners
in both conditions (EI) were then exposed to 104 sentences, 52 of
which provided exposure to the direct object marker rule. Although
the +EI group performed better offline in a grammaticality judgment
test, there was no evidence that EI developed into knowledge that
was beneficial online, as measured by predictive eye movements.
Second, again in an artificial language study, Marsden, Williams,
and Liu (2013) investigated the effects of task-essential practice with
yes/no feedback on interpreting inflections for tense and number
(Experiment 3). Again, findings were that offline measures (accuracy
of lexical decisions) demonstrated learning, but online measures
(reaction times in a cross-modal priming task) provided no evidence
that training the learners to orient their attention to the meaning
of the inflection had affected online processing of cross-modal
representations.
Related to the knowledge gap about the effects of L2 EI and practice on online performance is whether L1 EI and practice can affect
L2 online processing. This is of particular relevance for features with
cross-linguistic differences in processing routines. Of course, some
theories foreground a role for the L1 in critical aspects of input
processing, such as attention allocation being entrenched by the L1
(Ellis, 2006); processing routines being influenced by the L1 when a
feature is not unique to the L2 (MacWhinney, 2005); or L2 processing
routines being difficult to learn in cases where adopting related L1
routines would require fewer processing resources (O'Grady, 2005,
2015). There is also growing evidence of L1 coactivation/influence
during online L2 sentence processing (e.g., Tolentino & Tokowicz,
2011). Tokowicz and Warren's (2010) self-paced reading (SPR) study
with beginner learners reported slower reading times at morphosyntactic violations for L2 Spanish features that were cross-linguistically
similar (verb aspect licensing), but not for those that were entirely

L1 Explicit Instruction and L2 Online and Offline Performance

463

unique to the L2 (determiner-noun gender agreement). Similarly,
Roberts and Liszka (2013) with advanced learners found slower
reading times at morphosyntactic (aspectual) violations in L2
English when L1 and L2 both grammaticalized aspect (L1 French),
but not when the means of expressing aspect was unique to the L2
(L1 German). L1-L2 morphosyntactic coactivation has also been
documented among bilinguals, for example, during comprehension
(Sanoudaki & Thierry, 2014), production (Runnqvist, Gollan, Costa, &
Ferreira, 2013), and cross-linguistic priming (Hartsuiker & Pickering,
2008). However, there is surprisingly little evidence about the role
of the L1 in online processing among learners, rather than bilinguals/
near natives. As VanPatten (2015, p. 120) noted, "the question is
open as to whether and to what degree there is L1 influence in
basic Input Processing, and whether that influence is an actual processing procedure or lexical influence." Critically, as noted in the
preceding text, there is very little, if any, research on the influence of
L1 explicit information and practice on online processing that could
inform us about the development of sentence processing in instructed
contexts.
RATIONALE FOR THE CURRENT STUDY
In sum, the preceding lines of research inform our understanding
about the roles of EI with practice in L2 offline knowledge and about
the existence of L1 effects in L2 online processing. But there is no
research, to our knowledge, that investigates (a) the potential benefits
of EI with practice (L1 or L2) on online processing for learning a natural language over time and (b) the benefits of EI about the L1 with
practice in processing it (on offline or online performance).
It remains an empirical question as to whether providing EI about
and practice in the different processing routines in learners' L1 can
benefit L2 learning. Benefits may be found if making a processing routine explicit could create some declarative knowledge that might serve
processing and learning in a variety of ways. For example, clarifying
and rehearsing nontransparent, conceptual distinctions in the L1
(e.g., polyfunctionality of the English "-ed" verbal morpheme; McManus,
2015) may facilitate accurate mapping of those concepts to L2 forms,
compatible with views that assume a role for EI and explicit rehearsal in
language development (DeKeyser, 2015). Thus, L1 and L2 EI with meaningbased practice may lead to new or more efficient L2 processing routines. Initially represented declaratively, these routines may gradually
become proceduralized and automatized through practice (DeKeyser,
2015). Combined L1 and L2 EI and practice may also provide data
about morphosyntactic distributions of features in the input that could,

464

Kevin McManus and Emma Marsden

according to some theories (e.g., Ellis, 2006, 2008; see Andringa & Curcic,
2015), interface with the developing language system and promote L2
form-meaning remapping.
A POTENTIAL TESTING GROUND: THE FRENCH IMPARFAIT
The IMP is well documented to be late acquired, even after considerable
naturalistic exposure (Bartning & Schlyter, 2004), and its habitual meaning
in particular has been shown to be influenced by L1 background (Howard,
2005; Izquierdo & Collins, 2008; McManus, 2013, 2015). Although French
and English both express past habituality and ongoingness with verbal
morphology, these are mapped differently. For English-speaking learners
of French, this is illustrated in 1-2.
1.Past ongoing and habitual meanings can be expressed by one morpheme
in French (a), but not in English (b and c):
(a)Il jouaitIMP_ongoing_a/habit_b au foot quand j'ai_a appele/ quand nous etions_b
petits
"He playIMP_ongoing_a/habit_b football when I_PERF_a called / when we were_IMP_b
little"
(b)He was ongoing_a playing football
(c)He played_habit_b football
2.Past perfective and habitual meaning can be expressed by one morpheme in
English (a), but not in French (b and c):
(a)He playedPERF_a /IMP_habit_b football once last year_a / every Saturday_b
(b)Il jouait_habit_j au foot quand nous etions_j petits
"He play IMP_habit_b football when we were_IMP_j small"
(c)Il aPERF_a joue au foot
"He PERFplay football"

These sentences illustrate that one French inflectional verb morpheme alone does not disambiguate habitual from ongoing meaning
in the past. Nor do lexical phrases reliably co-occur with IMP to distinguish between ongoing and habitual ("la semaine derniere" ["last
week"] co-occurs with morphology other than IMP). However, morphosyntactic information in the discourse context is a reliable cue to
meaning (De Swart, 1998; Smith, 1997). That is, to resolve the aspectual ambiguity inherent in IMP, the discourse context either provides
an "interruption" to the event through the past perfective, Passe
Compose (PC), thus coercing an ongoing meaning of IMP (sentence 1a_a);
or it provides concurrent information with another IMP, coercing a
habitual meaning (sentence 1a_b and 2b_b) (Comrie, 1976). The IMP
can be before or after its disambiguating verb, and not necessarily in
the same sentence or speech turn.

L1 Explicit Instruction and L2 Online and Offline Performance

English, by contrast, does not require interclausal morphosyntax to
disambiguate past habituality from ongoingness. Instead, this is done
within a clause using verb morphology and/or lexical means, leaving
no ambiguity in need of resolution, for example, I was walking = past
ongoingness; I walked/used to walk/would walk = habituality.
If learners tend to rely on L1 English processing routines they
would not reliably use morphological information in the discourse
to disambiguate past habituality from ongoingness (which arguably
demands more processing resources than immediate disambiguation within the verb phrase [O'Grady, 2005, 2015]). This could result
in nonoptimum (less accurate and slower) interpretations of IMP.
It seems possible that EI with practice that renders explicit the mapping procedures required in L1 could facilitate the remapping of procedures for interpreting the L2.
TASK-ESSENTIAL FORM-MEANING MAPPING PRACTICE FOR
ASPECTUAL DISTINCTIONS
A large body of research has demonstrated the learning benefits of
focusing learners' attention on making form-meaning mappings from
the input (Loschky & Bley-Vroman, 1993; VanPatten, 1996, 2002). This
has included presenting stimuli without temporal adverbs, thus forcing
attention on the temporal meaning of verb inflections (e.g., Benati,
2005; Marsden, 2006; Marsden & Chen, 2011; Sagarra & Ellis, 2013),
without overt subjects, thus forcing attention on person and number
meanings (Marsden, 2006; Marsden et al., 2013), or without lexical
phrases for doubt and certainty, forcing attention on subjunctive
versus indicative inflections (Fernandez, 2008). Task-essential formmeaning input mapping practice has been found to lead to more learning
than input activities with equal numbers of target features that focus
attention on verb semantics or sentential meaning (Marsden, 2006;
Marsden & Chen, 2011).
To date, two studies have examined task-essential activities involving
IMP (Benati, Lee, & Laval, 2008 and Lee, Benati, Aguilar-Sanchez, &
McNulty, 2007).2 These studies removed aspecto-temporal adverbs
(e.g., tous les jours "every day") that can sometimes co-occur with IMP
and may render it less likely to be attended (VanPatten, 2002). However,
no research has yet investigated how to make task-essential the two
different aspectual meanings of IMP--ongoingness and habituality.
As described in the preceding text, this can only be determined reliably
by morphosyntactic information in the discourse context. To date, we do
not know whether task-essential practice can help learning that requires
co-indexation with morphosyntax in another clause to ascertain the correct form-meaning mapping.

CURRENT STUDY
The current study begins to address the gaps identified in the preceding
text by (a) investigating a hitherto neglected target feature--two aspectual
dimensions of the French IMP that require interclausal morphosyntactic
cues (past habituality and ongoingness); (b) measuring both the speed of
online processing and offline interpretation to investigate learning; and (c)
investigating the role of L1 EI and L1 task-essential practice in L2 learning.
Based on previous research, we expected that L2 EI and task-essential
practice would result in gains in offline measures, whereas the control condition (tests only) would not. As little/no research has examined specifically
(a) the online effects of EI with task-essential practice (L1 or L2) or (b) the
role of L1 EI with practice, we could not adopt strong expectations for these
two dimensions of the study. However, for (a), based on research suggesting
links between processing and learning, we thought that online measures
might show increased sensitivity to correct/incorrect use of IMP following
both L2-only and L2+L1 treatments. This is partly because our treatments
included extensive form-meaning mapping practice, unlike previous studies
that have not found online effects for EI or practice. For (b), based on
research suggesting L1-L2 coactivation during processing and evidence
of potential benefits of making explicit and rehearsing cross-linguistically
complex form-meaning mappings, it was thought that, compared to control,
the L2+L1 treatment would lead to larger and more consistent online and
offline effects than the L2-only treatment compared to control.
METHOD
Participants
Participants were 50 (42 females, 8 males) English-speaking learners of
French as a foreign language in semester two of a four-year bachelor of
arts honors degree in French at a large university in England. We required
every participant to be a native speaker of English, have completed
A-level (A2) French (equivalent to level B2 in the Common European
Framework of Reference for Languages, normally after about 700 to
800 hours of instruction), and not to have spent more than six weeks in a
French-speaking country. We collected background information using a
questionnaire and excluded six people based on these criteria. Participants' mean age was 19, and the mean time spent in a French-speaking
country was 3.8 weeks. Thirty-nine participants declared knowledge
of other romance languages (Spanish = 29, Portuguese = 5, Italian = 4),
twelve declared knowledge of German, and twelve declared knowledge of
other languages (two each for Greek, Latin, and Welsh, and one each for
Arabic, British Sign Language, Japanese, Mandarin, Polish, and Russian).

Design
The study had three between-subjects groups (control, L2-only, L2+L1) and
three within-subject tests (pretest in week 1, posttest in week 5, delayed
posttest in week 12). All tests and treatments were administered one-to-one
with laptops using E-Prime 2.0 (Schneider, Eschman, & Zuccolotto, 2012).
We assigned participants to a group using matched randomization,3 resulting in 17 participants in the L2+L1 group, 17 in the L2-only group, and 16 in
the control group (tests only). By contemporary standards these are small
numbers, due to the amount of time and relatively long timescale required
by the study, and we acknowledge, therefore, that this constitutes an
exploratory study. The treatments were delivered in four 45-minute sessions over three weeks, totaling 3.5 hours. Sessions 1 and 2 were delivered
in week 2, session 3 in week 3, and session 4 in week 4. The control group
completed all tests and did not receive any intervention treatment, but
continued normal instruction along with all other participants between
pre- and posttests. Due to the vacation between posttests and delayed
posttests, none of the participants received any instruction (either as part
of their university program or our experiment). This increased the likelihood that any effects found at delayed posttest were due to our intervention. In the university program from which all participants were drawn,
explicit grammar instruction only took place in semester 1, that is, prior to
the study, corroborated by interviews with university tutors. The entire
study was piloted in a condensed timescale with 10 English-speaking
learners of French at another university.

TARGET STRUCTURE: FRENCH IMP
All exemplars of IMP were third-person singular forms. This included 25
regular (e.g., jouait) and 23 irregular (e.g., finissait) verb types. Regulars
and irregulars were included because (a) the study's focus was inflectional morphology that remains orthographically and phonologically
constant in the IMP across regular and irregular stems (L'Huillier, 1999);
(b) the tests were receptive and so production of irregular stems was
not measured; and (c) there is some evidence that learning the two
functions of IMP (habitual and ongoing) may relate to lexical verb type
(e.g., activities--manger, achievements--arriver), and as we wished to
counterbalance lexical types this entailed inclusion of frequent irregular verbs (Andersen & Shirai, 1994);4 (d) the study's ecological validity
was increased by including both regular and irregulars; and (e) any
potential effect of verb type was experienced by all three participant
groups equally, as verb types were counterbalanced across test versions,
and test versions counterbalanced across conditions and test phases.

INSTRUCTIONAL TREATMENTS
The L2+L1 and L2-only treatments included an identical core of EI and
practice in interpreting French IMP.5 We first describe this common
core, before describing the L1 treatment received by the L2+L1 group
(see also Supplementary Materials: Treatment). All instructional treatments and outcome measures are publicly accessible in the IRIS digital
repository at http://www.iris-database.org.

EI About the L2
EI was provided in two ways: (a) prepractice, approximately five minutes
at the start of each session; and (b) during the task-essential practice
activities following only incorrect answers, which, as Supplementary
Materials: Treatment shows, was infrequent and occurred in almost
identical amounts in both treatments. The prepractice EI depicted
conceptual-semantic information using a short video, image, or sound
file of events. Then the appropriate aural and written forms were presented, and information given about how to interpret their meaning.

Practice in Interpreting the L2
The short prepractice EI was followed by task-essential, form-meaning
mapping practice; listening and reading in equal amounts; and focusing
attention on meaning contrasts expressed by different forms. In line with
other task-essential activities, this was done through learners choosing
the meaning of a stimulus from fixed options (e.g., Marsden, 2006;
Marsden & Chen, 2011; Sanz & Morgan-Short, 2004; VanPatten, 2002).
The numbers of French exemplars are shown in Table 1. The practice
drew on 48 lexical verb types: each one occurred eight times with IMP
(n = 384): four for reading (two habitual, two ongoing/interrupted) and four
for listening (two habitual, two ongoing/interrupted). The lexical semantic
properties of verb types were counterbalanced across listening/reading
and ongoing/habitual items: 12 states (e.g., be happy), 12 activities
(e.g., swim in the sea), 12 accomplishments (e.g., walk to the shop), and 12
achievements (e.g., arrive home). Verb type frequency was balanced across
the four lexical semantic classes using Lonsdale and Le Bras's (2009)
frequency dictionary of French. Aural stimuli were recorded by two native
French speakers. The French sentences were verified for authenticity by 26
native French speakers: All were rated as 100% acceptable, with the meanings (ongoing/ habitual, present/past) as intended by the researchers.

The L2+L1 Treatment
The L2+L1 group received the exact same treatment as previously
mentioned, with no additional French L2 exemplars. The L2+L1 treatment additionally included EI about English and task-essential formmeaning mapping practice in English. Table 2 shows the numbers of
tokens of English exemplars (all third-person singular). See Supplementary Materials: Treatment for full descriptions and example activities

OUTCOME MEASURES
Two versions of each outcome measure were administered in a splitblock design. The versions alternated the lexical items carrying IMP and
PC inflections and the order of items.

Context-Matching Tests (Listening and Reading)
All participants took two context-matching tests: first a listening
(CMT-Listen), then a reading (CMT-Read), each with 24 target and 8
filler trials. Each trial consisted of two parts: (a) the English context:
two sentences describing either a habitual or an ongoing activity
written in English and (b) the French stimulus: a two-clause French
sentence that either matched (k = 12) or mismatched (k = 12) the
meaning of the English context. Critically, the French stimuli and
English contexts were never translations of each other; rather, the
context gave a fuller description of an event in which either a habitual
or ongoing function of IMP would be required, on different lexical items,
in the shorter stimulus sentence. In this way, we were not eliciting
direct translations between context and stimulus, but specific functions of IMP. For example, see the following text.

Matched Trial in CMT-READ
Context (ongoing): Yesterday, Patrick was expecting his wife to come back
from work any minute. Just as he was on his way out, she appeared in the
driveway.
Stimulus (ongoing): Quand Patrick quittait la maison, il a vu sa femme
"When Patrick was leaving the house, he saw his wife"

Mismatched Trial in CMT-READ
Context (ongoing): Yesterday, Patrick was expecting his wife to come back
from work any minute. Just as he was on his way out, she appeared in the
driveway.
Stimulus (habitual): Quand Patrick quittait la maison, il voyait sa femme
"When Patrick left the house, he used to see his wife"

In both CMTs the English context appeared on screen for 10 seconds.
Then, the French stimulus appeared orally (CMT-Listen) or in writing
(CMT-Read). Participants were instructed to rate how good the match
was between the meaning of the French stimulus and English context
by pressing a number on the keyboard from 1 ("very good"), 2 ("good"),
3 ("neither good nor bad"), 4 ("poor"), and 5 ("very poor"), with a separate option for "I don't know" (9). The written French stimulus remained
on screen until a number was pressed, and then participants could not
change their answer. The task was untimed and took approximately
20 to 25 minutes.
The CMTs drew on 24 of the 48 lexical verbs (third-person singular) from
the intervention.6 Items were counterbalanced across the match and
mismatch conditions for: ongoingness/habituality, verb frequency, lexical
aspect class, verb regularity, and clause ordering (main- > subordinate /
subordinate- > main).
In addition to the pilot study, we checked the English contexts with three
native speakers of English, the French stimuli with 26 native speakers of
French, and the match and mismatch combinations with three L1 English
very advanced learners of French.
Self-Paced Reading Test
The SPR test was administered after the CMTs and used 16 items from
the CMT-Listen,7 with eight context-stimulus matches and eight mismatches, counterbalanced as described in the preceding text for the
CMT tests. Half the items were followed by yes/no comprehension
questions to increase the likelihood that participants focused on meaning
(see Keating & Jegerski, 2015).8 The answers to the questions only
depended on a lexico-semantic feature (but not verb stems) and not
on inflectional morphology. For each trial, the English context appeared
for 10 seconds before an X appeared in the center of the screen.
A spacebar press brought up the first and then each subsequent word
of the French stimuli. After the last word, the next screen displayed
"END." Participants were instructed to read as quickly as possible.
Reaction times were collected from each word according to the noncumulative moving-window procedure (Marinis, Roberts, Felser, &
Clahsen, 2005). The font was 18-point Courier New, displayed in the
center of a white background, without line breaks.
DATA SCORING AND ANALYSIS
For the CMTs, responses were coded following standard protocols for
judgment tasks (see Mackey & Gass, 2013): five points for each correct

Kevin McManus and Emma Marsden

472

response (i.e., pressing 1 or 2 for match trials, and 4 or 5 for mismatch
trials); three points for midway responses (pressing 3 for match and
mismatch trials); and one point for each incorrect response (pressing
4 or 5 for match trials, and 1 or 2 for mismatch trials). Cronbach's alphas
were: CMT-Listen version A ( = .72), CMT-Listen version B ( = .74),
CMT-Read version A ( = .72), and CMT-Read version B ( = .74).
In the SPR, reaction times in each French stimulus were on the critical
word, underlined for illustrative purposes in Table 3--the verb in the
coordinating clause (either IMP or PC) that disambiguated the main
clause verb's meaning (habitual vs. ongoing). Mean sentence length
was 10 words (SD = 1.5, range 9-14). Mean length of the critical word was
2.3 syllables for IMP and 2.9 for PC (all auxiliaries were one syllable, past
participle mean = 1.9), with bi- and trisyllabic words counterbalanced
across test versions. Reaction times (RT) for the critical word were calculated from the onset of the critical word to the onset of the next word.9 We
also analyzed whole sentence RTs calculated as the time taken to read
from the onset of the first word to the onset of the "END" screen. We analyzed the raw RT data, which we trimmed in line with recommendations
for SPR (Keating & Jegerski, 2015), removing critical word RTs less than
150 ms and greater than 2,000 ms (three [0.5%, habitual match] and four
[0.7%, ongoing match] data points across 50 participants).
Slower RTs are usually interpreted as indications of a processing burden, and, conversely, faster RTs as indications of relative processing

Whether the analysis was carried out on the auxiliary (a), the past participle (vu) or both combined
(a + vu) did not make any difference to the pattern of findings. Thus, for parity with the IMP critical
words, the raw data we present for the Passe Compose are for the auxiliary.

ease (e.g., Leung & Williams, 2014; Marinis et al., 2005). We therefore
analyzed RTs for changes over time in different training conditions.
We also compared RTs in matched versus mismatched trials, to detect
changes in sensitivity to violations in the use of IMP. If learners became
more sensitive to the different functions of IMP following training, it was
expected that differences in their RTs between match and mismatch
trials would become (more) apparent. For example, following a habitual
context, if learners were sensitive to a context-stimulus anomaly, an
IMP+PC stimulus (mismatch) would cause a slower RT compared to
an IMP+IMP (match).
As none of the data were normally distributed (according to ShapiroWilks tests, all data sets p < .05, see Supplementary Materials: Statistics,
Table 5), we present the results of nonparametric tests (Field, 2013;
Norris, Plonsky, Ross, & Schoonen, 2015). Nevertheless, for parity with
other studies, we note that the patterns of findings did not differ when
parametric tests were used (i.e., mixed-design ANOVAs with planned
contrasts).
First, between-group differences at pretest were checked using KruskallWallis H tests. Second, Friedman tests were used to compare pretest,
posttest, and delayed posttest scores within each group, and, if a significant difference was found, then within-subject comparisons were made
using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests with Bonferroni corrected alpha levels
(equivalent to post hoc analyses) between pairs of test results: pre-post,
pre-delayed, and post-delayed. Finally, we compared SPR performance
between matched and mismatched trials, in each group, with Wilcoxon
Signed-Rank tests.10
Following recent discussion on decreasing the probability of Type II
errors, including the observation that p-values can be strongly influenced by sample size (Plonsky, 2015; Plonsky & Oswald, 2014) and that
low stakes outcomes should entail setting higher alpha levels (Norris,
2015), for the Kruskall-Wallis H and Friedman tests the alpha level was
set at 0.10.11 For the post hoc Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests, we used a
Bonferroni adjustment making the revised alpha value 0.10/3 = .033
because three comparisons were carried out for each significant omnibus test result (Field, 2013). For interpreting the magnitude of change,
we present Cohen's d effect sizes for all paired comparisons. Effect sizes
between tests, that is, within-subjects, were calculated in relation to the
mean and standard deviation of the pretest as a baseline (and the posttest for effect sizes at delayed posttest). As within-subject effect sizes tend
to be larger than between-subject, we also give effect sizes compared to
the control group using the mean and standard deviation of the control group, Tables 5 and 7, with both the raw effect size and an adjusted
effect size corrected for baseline differences (even though all were nonstatistically significant differences, Plonsky & Oswald, 2014). Following
Plonsky and Oswald (2014), Cohen's d field-specific benchmarks are used

474

for interpretation: d = .40 (small), .70 (medium), and .10 (large). Confidence
intervals for effect sizes are in the Supplementary Materials: Statistics
(Tables 2 and 3).
RESULTS
Results are presented first for habitual contexts, then for ongoing
contexts, separately for matched and mismatched trials. After establishing baseline parity at pretest, we present change over time within
each group on each test (CMT-Read, CMT-Listen, and SPR critical word
and whole sentence) and effect sizes compared to the control group
on each test. For the SPR, we present comparisons of matched versus
mismatched trials in each group.
HABITUAL CONTEXTS
The accuracy of judgments (CMTs) and reaction times (SPR) are presented
in Table 4. All participants achieved 100% accuracy in SPR comprehension questions. Clause ordering comparisons showed no significant effects
(see Table 1, Supplementary Materials: Statistics).
MATCHED TRIALS
Kruskall-Wallis tests revealed no statistically significant between-group
differences at pretest in CMT-Listen (X2(2) = .36, p = .84), CMT-Read
(X2(2) = .48, p = .77), SPR critical word (X2(2) = .32, p = .85), and SPR whole
sentence (X2(2) = .15, p = .93).
For the control group, in all three tests, there were no statistically
significant changes over time:
* C
 MT-Read, X2(2) = 2.03, p = .36 (pre-post, d = .33; pre-delayed, d = -.65; postdelayed, d = -.26).
* CMT-Listen, X2(2) = 1.35, p = .51 (pre-post, d = -.13; pre-delayed, d = -.13; postdelayed, d = .00).
* SPR critical word, X2(2) = 2.63, p = .27 (pre-post, d = -.25; pre-delayed, d = -.29;
post-delayed, d = -.05).
* SPR whole sentence, X2(2) = 3.88, p = .14 (pre-post, d = -.63; pre-delayed, d = -.67;
post-delayed, d = .03).

For the L2-only group:
* C
 MT-Read accuracy did not change over time (X2(2) = .25, p = .88: pre-post,
d = -.21; pre-delayed, d = .43; post-delayed, d = .51).

* C
 MT-Listen accuracy increased over time (X2(2) = 7.28, p = .03), due to prepost changes (Z = -2.16, p = .03, d = .69), but not pre-delayed (Z = -.51, p = .61,
d = .51) or post-delayed (Z = -1.18, p = .24, d = .00).
* SPR critical word RTs were not significantly different, though effect sizes
suggest possible trends (X2(2) = 1.53, p = .47: pre-post, d = -.63; pre-delayed,
d = -.67: post-delayed, d = -.03).
* SPR whole sentence RTs got faster over time (X2(2) = 12.12, p = .00), pre-post
(Z = -2.34, p = .02, d = -.55) and pre-delayed (Z = -2.72, p = .01, d = -.68), with
minimal change post-delayed (Z = -1.16, p = .25, d = -.16).

For the L2+L1 group, we found significant improvement over time on
all measures:
* C
 MT-Read (X2(2) = 9.25, p = .01), with small effects pre-post (Z = -1.48, p =.14,
d = .41), large for pre-delayed (Z = 2.69, p = .01, d = 1.67), and with small effects
post-delayed (Z = -2.28, p = .02, d = .58).
* CMT-Listen (X2(2) = 7.36, p = .03), with small effects pre-post (Z = -.91, p = .36,
d = .35), large for pre-delayed (Z = -2.84, p = .00, d = 1.13), and medium effects
post-delayed (Z = -1.62, p = .10, d = .74).
* SPR critical word (X2(2) = 17.77, p = .00), pre-post (Z = -3.43, p = .00, d = -1.20)
and pre-delayed (Z = -3.29, p = .00, d = -1.14), but not post-delayed (Z = -.59, p = .55,
d = .02), with larger effect sizes than the L2-only group.
* SPR whole sentence (X2(2) = 12.82, p = .00), for pre-post (Z = -3.24, p = .00,
d = -1.06) and pre-delayed (Z = -3.19, p = .00, d = -.90), with no differences postdelayed (Z = -1.16, p = .25, d = .03).

Effect Sizes Compared to Control
As shown in Table 5, negligible effects were found between L2-only and
control at post and delayed in CMT-Read, SPR whole sentence and critical word. In CMT-Listen, negligible effects were found at post and a
small effect at delayed. In contrast, larger effects were found between
L2+L1 and control: in CMT-Listen, medium effects at post and large at
delayed; in CMT-Read, small at post and large at delayed; in SPR, for the
critical word, large at post and medium at delayed, and for the whole
sentence small at post and delayed.
MISMATCHED TRIALS
Kruskall-Wallis tests revealed no statistically significant between-group
differences at pretest in CMT-Listen (X2(2) = 1.22, p = .544, CMT-Read
(X2(2) = .01, p = .998), SPR whole sentence (X2(2) = 1.29, p = .52,), and
SPR critical word (X2(2) = .19, p = .91).

For the control group, there was no positive change over time:
* C
 MT-Read, X2(2) =.93, p = .63 (pre-post, d = .12; pre-delayed, d = .10; postdelayed, d = -.02).
* CMT-Listen accuracy scores deteriorated (X2(2) = 6.14, p = .05), pre-delayed
(Z = -2.63, p = .02, d = -.84) and post-delayed (Z = -2.30, p = .02, d = -.63), but not
pre-post (Z = -.79, p = .43, d = -.28).
* SPR critical word, X2(2) = .00, p = 1.00 (pre-post, d = -.18; pre-delayed, d = -.18;
post-delayed, d = -.06).
* SPR whole sentence, X2(2) = -3.88, p = .14 (pre-post, d = -.49 and pre-delayed,
d = -.53; post-delayed, d = -.11).

For the L2-only group, performance did not change over time:
* C
 MT-Read, X2(2) = .892, p = .89 (pre-post, d = .34; pre-delayed, d = .20; postdelayed, d = -.10).
* CMT-Listen, X2(2) = 1.58, p = .45 (pre-post, d = -.18; pre-delayed, d = .18;
post-delayed, d = .37).
* SPR critical word, X2(2) = 1.41, p = .49 (pre-post, d = -.11; pre-delayed, d = -.16;
post-delayed, d = -.09).
* SPR whole sentence, X2(2) = 4.35, p = .11 (pre-post, d = -.78; pre-delayed, d = -.59;
post-delayed, d = -.15).

For the L2+L1 group, improvement was observed for all tests:
* C
 MT-Read (X2(2) = 9.27, p = .10), although negligible effects were found prepost (Z = -1.09, p = .28, d = .37), large were found effects pre-delayed
(Z = -3.00, p = .00, d = 1.65), with and medium-to-large effects post-delayed
(Z = -2.29, p = .02, d = .90), notable given that no participant received
instruction post-delayed.
* CMT-Listen accuracy (X2(2) = 12.41, p = .00), with negligible effects pre-post
(Z = -.96, p = .34, d = .34), large effects pre-delayed (Z = -2.82, p = .01, d = 1.22),
and medium-to-large effects post-delayed (Z = -2.87, p = .00, d = 1.02), despite
no participant receiving instruction post-delayed.
* SPR critical word RTs also got faster (X2(2) = 19.88, p = .00), with mediumlarge effect sizes pre-post (Z = -3.43, p = .00, d = -.85), pre-delayed (Z = -3.57, p = .00,
d = -.1.09), but not post-delayed (Z = -.49, p = .62, d = -.34).
* SPR whole sentence RTs did not significantly change, (X2(2) = 3.29, p = .19:
pre-post, d = -.56; pre-delayed, d = -.26; post-delayed, d = .26).

Effect Sizes Compared to Control
For the L2-only group, effects were in CMT-Listen, negligible at
post but large at delayed; in CMT-Read, effects were negligible; in
SPR (critical word and whole sentence), effects were also negligible

(See Table 5). For the L2+L1 group, effects sizes were, in CMT-Listen,
large at post and delayed; in CMT-Read, small at post and large at
delayed; in SPR, effects on the critical word were small at post and
delayed, and for the whole sentence, small at post, but negligible at
delayed.
The results for habitual trials (matched and mismatched) suggest
patterns of greater accuracy and faster processing speeds following the
L2+L1 training (corroborated by confidence intervals in Supplementary
Materials: Statistics, Table 2). In terms of SPR results, we also note
(a) larger effects for critical word RT in L2+L1 than for whole sentence
RT; (b) effects for both critical word and whole sentence are larger
for L2+L1 than for L2-only and control, suggesting a larger effect for
the L2+L1 treatment on processing in general; and (c) any pre-delayed
effects for L2-only and control found for whole sentence RT are larger
than for critical word RT. Lastly, we do not see speed of processing
effects after post.

Reading Times in Matched Versus Mismatched Trials
At pretest, no group performed significantly differently across different
trial types:
* S
 PR critical word RT: control (Z = -1.66, p = .098, d = -.47), L2-only (Z = -1.44,
p = .15, d = -.4), L2+L1 (Z = -1.30, p = .19, d = -.37).
* SPR whole sentence RT: control (Z = -.26, p = .79, d = -.08), L2-only (Z = -1.30,
p = .19, d = -.37), L2+L1 (Z = -1.54, p = .124, d = -.45).

However, the L2+L1 group's RTs were significantly slower in mismatched compared to matched trials at both post and delayed for critical
word (post, Z = -2.72, p = .01, d = -.82; delayed, Z = -2.39, p = .02, d = -.82)
and whole sentence (post, Z = -1.97, p = .05, d = -.58; delayed, Z = -2.01,
p = .04, d = -.58). In contrast, we found no between-trial differences in
the L2-only and control groups:
* S
 PR critical word
L2-only: post (Z = -.02, p = .98, d = -.01), delayed (Z = -.40, p = .69,
d = -.12)
Control: post (Z = -.67, p = .50, d = -.19), delayed (Z = -.57, p = .61,
d = -.16)
* S

L2-only: post (Z = -.31, p = .76, d = -.08), delayed (Z = -1.25, p = .21, d = -.37)

ONGOING CONTEXTS
Accuracy of judgment (CMTs) and reaction times (SPR) are presented
in Table 6. All groups achieved 100% accuracy in SPR comprehension
questions. Clause ordering comparisons showed no significant effects
(Supplementary Materials: Statistics, Table 1).

MATCHED TRIALS
There were no significant between-group differences at pretest on any
measure (CMT-Read, X2(2) = .81, p = .67; CMT-Listen, X2(2) =.07, p = .96;
SPR critical word X2(2) = .04, p = .98; and SPR whole sentence, X2(2) = .01,
p = .99).
For the control group, there was no significant change over time on
any measure:
* C
 MT-Listen, X2(2) = 3.05, p = .22 (pre-post, d = .20; pre-delayed, d = -.22; postdelayed, d = -.44),
* CMT-Read, X2(2) = .26, p = .88 (pre-post, d = .20; pre-delayed, d = .16; postdelayed, d = -.05);
* SPR critical word, X2(2) = 3.88, p = .14 (pre-post, d = -.63; pre-delayed, d = -.47;
post-delayed, d = .02);
* SPR whole sentence, X2(2) = .50, p = .78 (pre-post, d = -.56; pre-delayed, d =
-.54; post-delayed, d = .09).

For the L2-only group, there was significant change pre-post in the
CMTs and SPR critical word, with very little improvement pre-delayed:
* C
 MT-Read (X2(2) = .12.00, p = .00), improved pre-post (Z = -2.76, p = .01, d = 1.02)
and pre-delayed (Z = -2.77, p = .01, d = 1.08), but not post-delayed (Z = -.09, p =
.93, d = .00).
* CMT-Listen (X2(2) = 3.18, p = .20), improved pre-post (Z = -2.303, p = .02, d = .75),
but not pre-delayed (Z = -.88, p = .38, d = .37) or post-delayed (Z = -.70, p =
.48, d = -.24).
* SPR critical word (X2(2) = 10.71, p = .01), RTs quickened pre-post (Z = -2.72, p = .01,
d = -.98), but not pre-delayed (Z = -1.97, p = .05, d = -.34), with no change
post-delayed (Z = -1.34, p = .18, d = -.54).
* SPR whole sentence RTs did not change over time (X2(2) = 4.24, p = .12:
pre-post, d = -.19; pre-delayed, d = -.53; post-delayed, d = -.39).

For the L2+L1 group, performance improved on all measures:
* C
 MT-Read (X2(2) = 27.09, p = .00), pre-post (Z = -3.413, p = .00, d = 1.67) and
pre-delayed (Z = -3.415, p = .00, d = 1.89), but not post-delayed (Z = -1.29, p =
.19, d = .35).

Effect Sizes Compared to Control
As shown in Table 7, for L2-only in CMT-Listen effects were small at post
and delayed; in CMT-Read, medium at post and large at delayed. In SPR,
there were negligible effects at post and delayed for critical word and
whole sentence RTs. In contrast, for the L2+L1 group we found larger
effects: in CMT-Listen, effects were small at post and large at delayed;
in CMT-Read, large at post and delayed; in SPR, effects were large for the
critical word at post and delayed and medium for whole sentence at both
post and delayed.
MISMATCHED TRIALS
There were no significant between-group differences at pretest (CMTListen, X2(2) = .05, p = .974; CMT-Read, X2(2) = 1.14, p = .57; SPR critical
word, X2(2) = .18, p = .91; SPR whole sentence, X2(2) = 1.03, p = .59).
For the control group, performance did not improve over time:
* C
 MT-Read, X2(2) = .45, p = .79 (pre-post, d = .39; pre-delayed, d = .26; postdelayed, d = -.09).
* CMT-Listen accuracy deteriorated (X2(2) = 7.17, p = .03): pre-delayed (Z =
-2.66, p = .01, d = -.71) but not pre-post (Z = -.91, p = -.36, d = -.29) or postdelayed (Z = -.51, p = .61, d = -.40).
* SPR critical word, X2(2) = .88, p = .65 (pre-post, d = -.12; pre-delayed, d = .10;

* SPR whole sentence, X2(2) = 3.50, p = .17 (pre-post, d = -.28; pre-delayed, d = -.52;
post-delayed, d = -.17).

For the L2-only group, we found no change over time on any measure:

* SPR whole sentence RTs did not change over time (X2(2) = .4.24, p = .12):
pre-post, d = -.49; pre-delayed, d = -.28; post-delayed, d = .17.

Effect Sizes Compared to Control
For the L2-only group, medium effect sizes were found in CMT-Listen
at both post and delayed, with negligible effects found in CMT-Read;
for SPR, there were no effects for both critical word and whole sentence processing (See Table 7). For the L2+L1 group, in CMT-Listen
effect sizes at post were small and large at delayed; in CMT-Read, effects
were negligible at post, but medium at delayed; in SPR, effect sizes
for the critical word were medium at both post and delayed, and effects
were negligible for the whole sentence.
In these comparisons to control, in matched and mismatched trials,
effects seemed larger in the L2+L1 group for accuracy and processing speed. Effect sizes for RTs on the critical word seemed particularly affected, and were larger than for the whole sentence, whereas
the L2-only group's effects on both critical word and whole sentence
were negligible, suggesting an across-the-board increase in processing speed due to test-familiarity cannot adequately explain the results.
(See also confidence intervals in Supplementary Materials: Statistics,
Table 3.) For example, for L2+L1, pre-delayed effect sizes are larger
for critical word RT than for whole sentence, and SPR effects sizes
for L2+L1 are consistently larger than for both L2-only and control,
suggesting an advantage for the L2+L1 treatment. Lastly, we do not
see speed of processing effects after posttest (except for L2-only in
ongoing match).

Reading Times in Matched Versus Mismatched Trials
At pretest, Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests revealed no significant betweentrial RT differences in any group:
* S
 PR critical word: control (Z = -.36, p = .72, d = -.10), L2-only (Z = -.17, p = .87,
d = -.04), L2+L1 (Z = -.59, p = .55, d = -.16).
* SPR whole sentence: control (Z = -.26, p = .77, d = -.08), L2-only (Z = -.88, p = .38,
d = -.24), L2+L1 (Z = -1.44, p = .15, d = -.41).

However, after the intervention, the L2+L1 group's processing was
significantly slower in mismatched than in matched trials at both
post (critical word, Z = -2.40, p = .02, d = -.72; whole sentence, Z =
-2.49, p = .01, d = -.75) and delayed (critical word, Z = -2.49, p = .01,
d = -.75; whole sentence, Z = -2.58, p = .01, d = -.77). In contrast, no
between-trial type differences were found for the L2-only and control
groups:

L2-only: post (Z = -1.16, p = .25, d = -.32), delayed (Z = -1.11, p = .27,

DISCUSSION
We examined the extent to which EI with task-essential form-meaning
practice influenced learners' online processing and offline interpretation of L2 French morphosyntax for past habituality and ongoingness.
An L2-only group received L2 EI with task-essential form-meaning practice. An L2+L1 group received the same, with additional L1 EI with taskessential form-meaning practice.

Summary of Findings
Our expectation that L2 EI with practice would result in learning gains,
whereas the control condition would not, was partially supported.
The control group showed no significant improvement over time (and
performed worse in the CMT-Listen pre-delayed, mismatched, habitual

486

Kevin McManus and Emma Marsden

and ongoing). For the L2-only group, some improvements were found,
although these were mostly in offline tasks and limited: development up
to delayed posttest was maintained only in CMT-Read (ongoing, matched);
short-term gains made in CMT-Listen (habitual, matched) and SPR
(ongoing, matched) were lost by delayed posttest; and negligible-to-no
gains were made in mismatched contexts in all tests. This is somewhat
inconsistent with previous research, which has shown clear benefits
for task-essential form-meaning mapping practice (e.g., Marsden, 2006;
Marsden & Chen, 2011; VanPatten, 2002). This discrepancy may relate
to the fact that the SPR online measure has not been used in previous
form-meaning practice studies. It could be that the interclausal nature
of the processing problem, and/or the specific cross-linguistic properties,
moderated the benefits of this instructional treatment.
Our hunch that the L2+L1 EI and task-essential practice would result
in development was supported, in all outcome measures at six weeks
after the intervention. Learners' interpretation of IMP had improved at
delayed posttest for both habitual and ongoing contexts, in matched
and mismatched trials, and in reading and listening CMTs. They also
increased the speed of distinguishing habitual and ongoing meanings
of IMP between pre-post, maintained at delayed, with larger and longer
lasting effect sizes than the L2-only group. Additionally, the L2+L1 group
demonstrated increased sensitivity to incorrect (mismatch) compared to
correct (match) usage of IMP. At pretest, all groups' processing speeds
were similar in matched and mismatched trials, indicating a lack of
online sensitivity. Only the L2+L1 group's processing in mismatched trials
became significantly slower relative to matched trials at post and delayed
posttest. In contrast, there continued to be no between-trial differences
for L2-only and control. These results are in line with findings about
sensitivity to the processing cost of anomalous aspectual distinctions
(Roberts & Liszka, 2013) and other violations (Leung & Williams, 2014;
Marinis et al., 2005; Tokowicz & Warren, 2010).
The likelihood that these observations were largely ascribable to the
pre-post phase is increased by the fact that participants received no
instruction at all post-delayed.

Learning Mechanisms Potentially at Play
Providing learners with EI about and practice in L1 form-meaning
mappings may have helped establish, or strengthen, conceptual representations of habituality and ongoingness. In turn, this may have facilitated the strengthening, through L2 instruction, of L2 mappings for
these concepts. By practising these (re)mappings, declarative knowledge of new processing routines may have been proceduralized and

L1 Explicit Instruction and L2 Online and Offline Performance

487

automatized, reflected in faster online processing (DeKeyser, 2015).
That is, the L1 EI clarified concepts and form-meaning mappings; the L1
practice reinforced these concepts and mappings; and the L2 EI and
interspersed practice strengthened the mappings between these (now
better represented) concepts and French forms. Our data largely supports evidence of difficulties created by cross-linguistic form-meaning
mapping differences (Izquierdo & Collins, 2008; McManus, 2013, 2015).
Observation of Online Effects
Our findings from SPR may be accounted for in various ways. The L2+L1
treatment could have reduced reliance on L1-based processing strategies for interpreting aspect--which do not require co-indexation with
interclausal morphosyntax--and routinized L2 processing strategies
that do require interclausal co-indexation. Indeed, the interweaving of
the English and French practice items may have promoted some coactivation of French morphosyntax when, at test, English contexts were
read. Thus, after reading the English, the L2+L1 group were more ready
to make a faster decision about the expected French morphosyntax.
Clearer habituality and ongoing conceptual distinctions could have
given anticipatory benefits for accessing the appropriate French in the
stimuli, for example, increasing the speed of processing interclausal
forms required for habituality. These findings are broadly compatible with
existing evidence about L1 effects during L2 processing (e.g., Sanoudaki &
Thierry, 2014; Tolentino & Tokowicz, 2011). However, further research
is required to examine whether (a) this coactivation is unique to mixed
language tests (our CMTs and SPR both included an L1 context and
L2 stimulus) and (b) current findings would hold for tests only presented in the L2. To this end, preliminary findings from spoken narrative tests (beyond the scope of the current article) suggest some
similar patternings of results in tests that do not provide an L1 context, suggesting that L1-L2 coactivation is not entirely restricted to
mixed language testing contexts. Further research should also examine whether comprehension and SPR tests that are only in the L2 would
pattern similarly.
However, our observations of online effects contrast with findings
from Andringa and Curcic (2015) and Marsden et al. (2013). A number of
reasons could explain this difference: our provision of L1 EI and practice;
our fuller EI about the L2 (compared to Andringa & Curic's brief EI
containing two examples, and Marsden et al.'s yes/no feedback); our
longer practice with its task-essential form-meaning mappings; our
different outcome measures (SPR here vs. anticipatory eye movements
in Andringa & Curic and cross-modal priming in Marsden et al.); and,
finally, our different target features and languages (a more established,

488

Kevin McManus and Emma Marsden

natural lexicon here vs. a novel artificial lexicon in Andringa & Curic
and Marsden et al.).
In sum, our findings suggest that providing L2+L1 EI and task-essential
form-meaning practice for a feature exhibiting complex L1-L2 differences
resulted in L2 performance that appeared to benefit from L1 knowledge,
rather than being adversely affected by it. Compatible with previous
studies that explored teaching/knowledge about the L1 for L2 learning
(Horst et al., 2010; Kupferberg, 1999; Spada et al., 2005), it seems likely that
our L2+L1 treatment was beneficial (and more reliably so than L2-only)
because of the specific nature of the learning problem, that is, L1-L2
form-meaning mapping differences. Our evidence therefore supports
the points raised by the opening quotation (Henry et al., 2009): that the
effectiveness of EI seems dependent on the nature of the EI, the target
structure, and processing problem.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
First, we emphasize that our findings and accounts of learning are
tentative, given our small sample sizes.
As described in the preceding text, the English exemplars in the L2+L1
condition were in addition to the L2-only treatment, and this difference
in exposure requires interpretation. We consider it highly unlikely that,
for English speakers who already have 19 years of exposure to English
as L1 speakers, the mere exposure alone to the English exemplars
would affect L2 French online or offline performance. Furthermore, as
described in the preceding text, English habituality and ongoingness
are expressed with entirely different morphology to French (played =>
jouait and a joue; was playing => jouait; used to play/would play =>
jouait). Thus, additional exposure alone to English is unlikely to change
the processing of French. We suspect, therefore, that the combination
of the EI about English and practice in interpreting the English and
French resulted in stronger conceptualizations, and more accurate
and faster (re)mapped interpretations of L2 French IMP. However,
further investigation, including replication, is required to isolate the
role of the English EI from the English practice in order to understand
the contribution of each to learning.
This data set clearly offers opportunities for further analyses that are
beyond the scope of this article, such as detailed statistical analyses
on the effects of lexical verb type and grammatical/viewpoint aspect,
in line with research informed by the Aspect Hypothesis (Andersen &
Shirai, 1994). We found tentative support for previous evidence that
habituality in French seems more difficult than ongoingness for L1 English
learners (Howard, 2005; McManus, 2013, 2015), as, descriptively, pretest
scores were slightly lower for habituality. However, we find no clear

L1 Explicit Instruction and L2 Online and Offline Performance

489

patterns of more improved performance in habituality versus ongoingness as a result of either treatment. That is, the effect sizes on our interpretation measures did not suggest more benefits for one meaning of IMP
than the other, although further research is required.
This study has provided some evidence that EI about the L1 with
interpretation practice had benefits on both off and online measures,
at least for our feature with cross-linguistic form-meaning differences.
However, further research is required, with larger sample sizes, to
ascertain whether this type of L2+L1 instruction would be as beneficial for different language features, including syntactic phenomena
with and without referential meaning, for different L1-L2 combinations,
and for different L2 proficiency levels. In particular, further research
should consider (a) the influence of different types of EI and practice
on processing over time and (b) the relationship of the L1-L2 morphosyntax and the extent to which types of EI and practice interface
with this, for online and offline behaviour. It is also important to investigate how changes in online and offline interpretation behavior relate
to the development of production.

NOTES
1. An anonymous reviewer pointed out that two recent dissertations (Dracos, 2013;
Henry, 2015) used online methods to test processing behavior changes as a result of practice with some type of EI, but they did not manipulate the type of EI with practice on L2
learning and did not investigate L1 EI and practice as in the current study.
2. Lee et al. (2007) primarily investigated the mode of delivery of PI materials
(computer vs. paper-based).
3. A cumulative score was created from a vocabulary test and scores from two pretest
measures (CMT-Listen, CMT-Read). The scores were rank ordered and each set of three
rank-ordered participants (e.g., ranks 1st, 2nd, 3rd) were randomly assigned to conditions.
4. The potential role of lexical semantics has been extensively researched (Andersen
& Shirai, 1994) and would involve extensive analysis along a range of variables, including
telic*atelic, regularity*irregularity, type/token frequency, and lexical semantics (4 levels),
and is therefore beyond the scope of the current analysis.
5. Participants did not speak or write during the EI (nor practice).
6. The same lexical verbs were used in each version, but in different contexts (e.g., he
went to the shop vs. she went to the stadium).
7. So that participants had not read the same stimuli twice in the same test phase.

8. Judgments about match/mismatches were not requested because explicit judgments in online tasks can lead to unusually slow or careful reading as well as tapping into
more explicit resources (see Keating & Jegerski, 2015).
9. Although we additionally analyzed spillover effects in the one, two, and three
words following the critical word, these are not reported because (a) they did not change
the patterning of the results; (b) the syntactic properties of the spillover words varied, for
example, determiner, adverb, or noun, making interpretation of processing speed difficult; and (c) space constraints do not allow such extensive results to be presented
and discussed.
10. For the RTs for the PC, we took the measurement from the auxiliary (though
patterns of results were the same for the entire PC and for the past participle).
11. We are grateful to Steven Ross and Luke Plonsky for this advice. For parity with
other studies, note that the same patterns of significance for these omnibus tests were
found whether we used alpha 0.10 or 0.05.
