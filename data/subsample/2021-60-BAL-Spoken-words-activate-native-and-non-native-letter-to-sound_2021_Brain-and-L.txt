Many languages use the same letters to represent different sounds (e.g., the letter P represents /p/ in English but
/r/ in Russian). We report two experiments that examine how native language experience impacts the acquisition
and processing of words with conflicting letter-to-sound mappings. Experiment 1 revealed that individual dif
ferences in nonverbal intelligence predicted word learning and that novel words with conflicting orthography-tophonology mappings were harder to learn when their spelling was more typical of the native language than less
typical (due to increased competition from the native language). Notably, Experiment 2 used eye tracking to
reveal, for the first time, that hearing non-native spoken words activates native language orthography and both
native and non-native letter-to-sound mappings. These findings evince high interactivity in the language system,
illustrate the role of orthography in phonological learning and processing, and demonstrate that experience with
written form changes the linguistic mind.

1. Introduction
Experience with language has lasting effects on learning and the
mind (Marian, 2023). Native language (L1) experience in particular
hones the brain to features and regularities of language input (Ellis,
2006; Schmitt, 2008). The present research investigated how experience
with L1 orthography-to-phonology mappings influences non-native
word processing. We taught participants vocabulary with non-native
letter-sound correspondences to examine how individual differences
(such as nonverbal IQ) and linguistic characteristics (such as native
language typicality) influence the learning of new mappings (Experi
ment 1) and whether native and non-native mappings are co-activated
during non-native auditory word processing (Experiment 2).
Oftentimes, two related languages share a subset of their ortho
graphic and phonemic inventories, but utilize conflicting letter-sound
mappings. For example, the letter J, is pronounced /d/ in English (a
voiced palato-alveolar affricate) but /x/ or /h/ in Spanish (a voiceless
velar fricative or voiceless glottal fricative), and the phoneme /v/ is
represented by the letter V in English but W in German. These differ
ences can compound at the word level, as illustrated by the diverging
pronunciations for the English-French cognate "destination," (English

/dEstIneIn/ and French /dEstinasj/) and the false cognates "champ"
(meaning field in French, and pronounced /taemp/ or //). Likewise,
the English and Russian interlingual homograph eep is pronounced
/bip/ in English, but /vjeir/ (meaning paper fan) in Russian. Because
phonological drift occurs more rapidly than orthographic changes over
the historical evolution of typologically related languages (Marian,
Bartolotti, Chabal, Shook, & White, 2012), differences in orthographyto-phonology mappings accumulate over time, with potential conse
quences for word learning and processing.
1.1. Orthography-to-Phonology mapping
Conflicting orthography-to-phonology correspondences are not
unique to bilinguals. English monolinguals, for example, must learn that
the letter C can take the /s/ or /k/ sound in different contexts, and
likewise the phoneme /d/ can be expressed either by G or J. This type
of within-language variability in letter-to-sound mappings is more
common in some languages (e.g., English) than in others (e.g., Italian),
which can contribute to differences in how speakers of different lan
guages learn and process words. Children who speak languages with
more consistent letter-sound mappings (i.e., high orthographic

transparency, e.g., Italian, Greek) have been shown to exhibit more
advanced reading skills than speakers of less transparent languages (e.g.,
English) (Ellis & Hooper, 2001; Spencer & Hanley, 2003; see Ziegler &
Goswami, 2005 for review). Likewise, adult second language (L2)
learners benefit from greater orthographic consistency in the L2 when
learning novel words (Burt & Blackwell, 2008; Taylor, Plunkett, &
Nation, 2011; see Meade, 2020 for review). A match in L1 and L2
orthographic transparency facilitates L2 word learning and phonolog
ical decoding (Hamada & Koda, 2008; Ijalba & Obler, 2015), demon
strating that knowledge and strategies developed for the native language
influence later acquisition and processing of non-native words.
Furthermore, while individual differences (e.g., in phonological
awareness) have been shown to predict children's reading skills for both
high- and low-transparency scripts (Bar-Kochva & Breznitz, 2014; Tor
gesen, Wagner, Rashotte, Burgess, & Hecht, 1997), the relationship
between individual differences and reading development can vary
depending on orthographic transparency. For instance, Ziegler et al.
(2010) found that individual differences in phonological awareness
were especially predictive of phonological decoding for children
learning less transparent languages (e.g., English), while vocabulary
knowledge was more predictive for those learning more transparent
languages (e.g., Finnish). Such findings reveal that linguistic charac
teristics and individual differences interact to influence acquisition of
native language letter-sound mappings. Relatively less is known, how
ever, about the variables that predict the acquisition and activation of
new mappings once the native language is fully established. The present
study therefore investigates the linguistic and cognitive factors that
moderate how adult native speakers of English (a low transparency
language) learn and process words with letter-to-sound mappings that
are consistent within the novel vocabulary but conflict with those of the
native tongue.

than non-cognates (De Groot & Keijzer, 2000; Lotto & De Groot, 1998)
due to scaffolding on the existing L1 framework. However, in proficient
L2 users' speech production, cognate words are typically more heavily
accented compared to non-cognates, because of their direct link to the
native language (Amengual, 2012; Goldrick, Runnqvist, & Costa, 2014).
Activation of the L1 can be both an early advantage and late disad
vantage for the L2 learner. Here, we examine whether learning words
with non-native letter-to-sound mappings is more challenging when
they look more like L1 words than when they have less familiar ortho
graphic forms.
Second language learners who are already literate in their native
language experience persistent L1 interference during phonological
decoding in an L2 (Hamada & Koda, 2008; Wang, Koda, & Perfetti,
2003). In fact, when letter-sound mappings in the L2 conflict with the
native language, presenting words' written forms in addition to their
spoken forms disrupts learning compared to auditory presentation alone
(Kaushanskaya & Marian, 2008, 2009). To determine what drives the
difficulty posed by conflicting letter mappings during novel word
learning, the challenges associated with learning new letter-to-sound
mappings must be disentangled from those stemming from the acquisi
tion of new letters or sounds. In most natural language pairs, the second
language learner learns not only new letter-sound correspondences, but
often new phonemes or graphemes as well. Categorical perception of L1
phonemes can distort perceptual discrimination and speech production
in late L2 learners (Iverson, Kuhl, & Akahane-Yamada, 2003; Kuhl &
Iverson, 1995), with consequences for second language processing and
representation (Baker & Trofimovich, 2005; Sebastian-Galles, Eche
verria, & Bosch, 2005). This perceptual mechanism may mask the
related, but distinct effect of conflicting letter-to-sound mappings be
tween the L1 and L2 on word learning. The present study disentangles
the effects of new perceptual learning and learning of new mappings by
keeping the same letters and sounds in the native and novel vocabulary
and manipulating only the mappings between orthography and
phonology.
To examine how conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings
and native language similarity impact vocabulary acquisition, learners
were taught artificial words with letters and sounds that were not new to
the learner but existed in their native language. Critically, the mappings
between the letters and sounds in the novel vocabulary differed from
those in L1 and had orthographic forms that were either typical or
atypical of L1 words.
In addition, to examine the processes engaged during vocabulary
acquisition, we assessed whether word learning and alphabetic knowl
edge was predicted by individual differences in cognitive abilities
(inhibitory control, nonverbal IQ) and linguistic skills and knowledge
(phonological working memory, English reading proficiency, English
vocabulary size). Domain-general cognitive functions such as cognitive
control could be expected to support word learning through more
effective inhibition of competing native language orthography-tophonology mappings (Blumenfeld, Schroeder, Bobb, Freeman, &
Marian, 2016; Linck, Schwieter, & Sunderman, 2012). Nonverbal fluid
intelligence (Brooks, Kempe, & Sionov, 2006) and verbal working
memory (Misyak & Christiansen, 2012), on the other hand, could
facilitate the extraction and encoding of non-native letter-sound regu
larities, which could deepen alphabetic knowledge about the novel vo
cabulary. Lastly, while native language proficiency may be associated
with a general aptitude for word learning (Baddeley, Logie, NimmoSmith, & Brereton, 1985; Braze, Tabor, Shankweiler, & Mencl, 2007),
it may also interfere with the acquisition of words with conflicting
orthography-to-phonology mappings, particularly when their ortho
graphic wordforms resemble those of the native tongue.

1.2. Word learning
Learning non-native vocabulary as an adult presents several chal
lenges that distinguish the task from first language vocabulary acquisi
tion. Foremost is the fact that the adult learner already commands a fully
functioning linguistic system which influences subsequent word
learning and processing. In addition, whereas one's L1 is first acquired
phonologically and only later orthographically, non-native input is often
experienced as a combination of written and spoken words. This early
availability of crossmodal information may have unique consequences
for novel word learning. For instance, the successful acquisition of the
Russian word eep for a native English speaker requires the ability to
manage conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings in the two
languages. As such interlingual homographs demonstrate, non-native
written word decoding is a convergence point for the challenges of L1
interference and cross-modal integration. In the current study, we
investigate this intersection by exploring how orthography and
phonology interact during early stages of adult non-native vocabulary
acquisition.
One's native language has both positive and negative effects on
second language learning and processing. Linguistic features that are
perceived by the learner to be similar in both languages can result in
positive transfer, facilitating L2 acquisition (Ionin, Zubizarreta, & Mal
donado, 2008; Jarvis & Odlin, 2000). Non-overlapping features can also
have negative effects on learning when structures in the L1 interfere
with nascent L2 knowledge (Bhela, 1999; Birdsong, 2014; MacWhinney,
2007). The way that the L1 and L2 intertwine, however, cannot be
comprehensively expressed as an accumulation of independent positive
and negative interactions. For example, cognate words, which overlap in
both form and meaning across languages, are generally easier to learn

Participant characteristics.

The second, critical aim of the present study was to examine
whether, following the acquisition of novel words in Experiment 1,
conflicting native and non-native mappings are co-activated when pro
cessing the auditory forms of the newly learned words. Prior work with
bilinguals has shown that knowledge of two languages with shared or
thographies that map onto different phonologies can affect visual word
processing. In visual go/no-go tasks, participants take longer when
responding to written homographs (which share form but not meaning
across languages), suggesting that orthography and semantics are acti
vated in both languages (Dijkstra, Timmermans, & Schriefers, 2000).
While this finding demonstrates that direct exposure to a written ho
mograph (e.g., the written word eep) can co-activate competing
phonological (/bip/ and /vjeir/) and semantic representations (a tone
and a paper fan), it remains an open question whether interference from
overlapping orthography can be driven by non-overlapping auditory
input during spoken language processing (e.g., the spoken word /bip/
activating the written form eep and corresponding English and Russian
pronunciations and meanings).
Previous studies using eye tracking have revealed co-activation of
phonological (e.g., Allopenna, Magnuson, & Tanenhaus, 1998; Huettig,
Rommers, & Meyer, 2011; Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard, &
Sedivy, 1995) and orthographic (e.g., Salverda & Tanenahus, 2010)
competitors in monolinguals, and co-activation of both languages in
bilinguals (e.g., Marian & Spivey, 2003; Shook & Marian, 2019; Spivey
& Marian, 1999). For instance, studies utilizing the Visual World Para
digm (VWP) have shown that when bilinguals are presented with a vi
sual array of objects (e.g., a marker, a marble, a stamp, and a shoe) and
asked to click on one of the objects (e.g., the "marker"), they will often
make visual fixations to objects whose labels overlap with the target,
both within the same language (e.g., the marble), as well as across
languages (e.g., the stamp, which translates to marka in Russian).
Whether the orthography-to-phonology mappings of native and nonnative vocabulary are co-activated, however, is yet unknown. The pre
sent research broaches this question by indexing co-activation of native
language orthography-to-phonology mappings during novel spoken
word processing using eye movements in the VWP.

from the native language (e.g., the novel word pronounced /guf/ (IPA
transcription) would be orthographically represented as HANE rather
than the expected-based-on-English-mappings GOOFA). Second, in word
learning: meaning, they learned to associate the novel words with picture
referents. Third, in word learning: letter knowledge, participants
completed two additional tests of their word learning, which assessed
how well they generalized their knowledge of novel orthography-tophonology mappings to untrained words.
The aim of Experiment 2 was to examine how, following the acqui
sition of novel words in Experiment 1, conflicting orthography-tophonology mappings impact the processing of recently-learned vocabu
lary and the extent to which the two modalities (visual in the case of
orthography and auditory in the case of phonology) and the two patterns
of letter-sound mappings (native and non-native) interact and are coactivated during spoken word comprehension. In other words, we ask
whether after learning novel vocabulary in Experiment 1, a participant
asked to "click on the /guf/" from an array of objects would make vi
sual fixations to an English cross-linguistic competitor that overlaps with
the target's orthographic form (e.g., a picture of a cane via activation of
the target's written form HANE). The activation of orthography during
spoken word processing was assessed in a cross-linguistic interference task
using the Visual World Paradigm (see Appendix A for full instructions of
each task).

1.4. The present study

2. Experiment 1: Word learning

In sum, the aims of the current research were two-fold. The first aim
was to examine the influence of individual differences and linguistic
characteristics on the initial acquisition of novel orthography-tophonology mappings. The second aim was to investigate whether
native and non-native orthography-to-phonology mappings are coactivated during non-native auditory word processing. Participants
completed two experiments in different phases of a single study session,
one focused on word learning and one on word processing. Experiment 1
examines how orthography-to-phonology mappings interact with indi
vidual differences and native-language typicality to impact new vo
cabulary learning. Specifically, we ask whether conflicting orthographyto-phonology mappings interfere with novel word learning and whether
this interference is (1) predicted by individual differences in cognitive
and linguistic skills and (2) exacerbated for words with more typical L1
spellings (i.e., greater interference for novel words with typical English
forms, e.g., HANE, relative to those with more atypical forms, e.g.,
RAKO). Word learning was assessed using three tasks. First, in word
learning: orthography, participants learned to match the written and
spoken forms of pseudowords that mapped letters to sounds differently

To investigate cross-modal effects on learning, we taught English
monolinguals artificial words containing familiar English graphemes
and phonemes, but novel orthography-to-phonology mappings that
differed from English (e.g., a word pronounced /guf/ and spelled
HANE). Successful acquisition required learners to minimize interfer
ence from English mappings in order to form correct associations for the
non-native vocabulary. Non-native vocabulary varied in wordform
similarity to English based on English bigram probabilities and the
number of English orthographic neighbors. We predicted that novel
words that used conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings, but
superficially resembled English and thus increased activation of the
native language (e.g., HANE), would be more difficult to learn than
words that used conflicting mappings but looked less like typical English
words (e.g., RAKO). To further explore the processes underlying the
acquisition of conflicting mappings, we examined whether successful
acquisition was predicted by individual differences in cognitive skills (e.
g., nonverbal IQ) and linguistic knowledge (e.g., English vocabulary
size).

2.1. Methods
2.1.1. Participants
Twenty monolingual English speakers (16 women) participated after
providing informed consent in accordance with the university's Insti
tutional Review Board. Eye tracking data for one participant was un
available due to equipment malfunction. Language background was
assessed using the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire
(LEAP-Q) (Marian et al., 2007). Participants had minimal second lan
guage proficiency (<= 3 out of 10). Cognitive and linguistic assessments
were used to identify the effect of individual differences on learning and
cross-linguistic competition, including non-verbal IQ (Wechsler Abbre
viated Scale of Intelligence, WASI, block design and matrix reasoning
subtests, PsychCorp, 1999), English vocabulary size (Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test III, PPVT, Dunn, 1997), self-reported English reading
proficiency (LEAP-Q, Marian, Blumenfeld, & Kaushanskaya, 2007),
phonological working memory (Comprehensive Test of Phonological Pro
cessing, CTOPP, digit span and nonword repetition subtests, Wagner,
Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999), and inhibitory control (colored squares
Simon task, Simon & Rudell, 1967). Standard scores for each measure
are included in Table 1.
2.1.2. Materials
A set of nonwords was created using 13 mismatching English
graphemes and phonemes (4 vowels and 9 consonants). To enhance task
engagement, participants were informed that they would be learning
words from a language called Colbertian. This name was chosen to
honor comedy show wordsmith and Northwestern University School of
Communication alumnus Stephen Colbert (as in Bartolotti & Marian,
2017). The letter-sound mappings in Colbertian were designed to
maximally differ from English. For example, whereas the English letter B
corresponds to /b/, a voiced bilabial stop, the Colbertian letter B cor
responds to the phoneme /s/, a voiceless alveolar fricative. English
vowels were mapped to Colbertian vowels (e.g., the letter A would be
pronounced /u/ in Colbertian) and English consonants were mapped to
Colbertian consonants (e.g., the letter H would be pronounced /g/ in
Colbertian). Because different characteristics are typically used to
describe vowels (height, backness, rounding) and consonants (place of
articulation, manner of articulation, voicing), mapping sounds within
each class across languages enabled us to select Colbertian sounds that
explicitly differed along each dimension within that class.
The inventory of 13 letters was used to create 24 bisyllabic words in
Colbertian, each composed of four letters (all orthography-to-phonology
mappings and Colbertian words are provided in Appendix A). The novel
words were designed to vary in how closely their orthographic forms
adhered to English lexical patterns, based on a wordlikeness metric
comprising English neighborhood size (i.e., the number of English words
that differed from the novel word by substitution, deletion, or addition
of a single letter) and bigram probability (i.e., the average frequency of
each pair of letters in the novel word). Twelve High-Englishlike words
(e.g., HANE) had both high English neighborhood sizes (M = 16.08, SD
= 3.48) and bigram probabilities (M = 0.028, SD = 0.008). Twelve LowEnglishlike words (e.g., RAKO) had both smaller neighborhoods (M =
6.58, SD = 5.25, t(22) = 5.23, p < .001) and bigram probabilities (M =
0.013, SD = 0.005, t(22) = 16.01, p < .001). Phonological stimuli for
each Colbertian word were recorded by a female speaker of Standard
American English. Stimuli presentation throughout the experiment was
controlled by the experimental software MATLAB with the Psycho
physics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli, 2007; Pelli,
1997).

Fig. 1. Word learning procedure. A) During orthographic word learning, par
ticipants heard a target word in the new language and selected its matching
written form. Feedback was provided after each trial to reinforce the correct
association. Participants repeated blocks of 24 trials until they achieved a
learning criterion of 90% accuracy on two consecutive blocks. B) During wordmeaning learning, participants heard and saw a Colbertian target and selected
the matching picture. Corrective feedback was provided. As in orthographic
word learning, training continued until the performance criterion of 90% ac
curacy on two consecutive blocks was achieved.

2.1.3. Procedure
Word learning: Orthography. First, participants were exposed to the 24
Colbertian words, one at a time. A single word was presented auditorily
over headphones while its spelling was presented in the center of the
computer screen; participants repeated the word out loud and clicked
the mouse to advance. Then participants completed individualized
training regimes to master the language (Fig. 1A). A single training block
included 24 trials with each word as a target once. In each trial, par
ticipants viewed four written words on the screen and heard the target
over headphones. After making a selection by clicking on one of the
written words, accuracy was recorded and the correct answer was pro
vided as feedback so that participants could improve over time. Addi
tional training blocks were repeated until the participant achieved a
performance criterion of 90% accuracy on two consecutive blocks.
Word learning: Meaning. After learning auditory words' spellings,
participants learned to associate the words they had just acquired with
picture meanings. First, participants were shown all 24 pairings. A
Colbertian word was presented visually and auditorily along with four
pictures, and the target was indicated by a red box. Then, as in wordform learning, participants completed individualized training regimes
to master the pairings (Fig. 1B) using the same performance criterion
(90% accuracy on two consecutive testing blocks). In each trial, the
Colbertian target word was presented visually and auditorily, and four
pictures were shown in the corners of the screen (in order to reduce

novelty effects in the subsequent cross-linguistic interference task,
competitors and fillers were used as foils during learning, but were
paired with different targets). After selecting a picture, the correct
answer was provided as feedback so that participants could reinforce the
correct association.
Word learning: Letter knowledge. Two phonetic generalization tasks
probing recognition and production were used to assess how well par
ticipants learned Colbertian's underlying letter-to-sound mappings. In
the recognition task, four new Colbertian written words were presented
on the screen. The auditory target was presented over headphones, and
the participant selected the matching word. In 24 Low Similarity trials,
knowledge of a single letter was sufficient to identify the target, because
all four words contained unique letters at each position. (e.g., Target
/suz/ spelled BAPE does not have any letters in the same position as
Foils KOVI, VEDO, or RINA). In 24 High Similarity trials, each foil
partially overlapped with the target, and thus an accurate response
required knowledge of multiple Colbertian letters (e.g., Target /wtae/
spelled KEDI shares letters with foils KOVA, NADO, and BERI). Low and
High Similarity trials were intermixed during testing.
In the production task, participants viewed 48 novel written Col
bertian words (of ConsonantVowelConsonantVowel format) in sequence
and verbally produced the phonological form. Responses were phonet
ically transcribed by hand. Word accuracy was the percentage of novel
words produced correctly. For each participant, letter accuracy was
calculated across all novel words as a measure of their knowledge of
word-embedded letter-to-sound mappings.

words). The base model included all time terms and random effects of
participant on all time terms. The effect of Englishlikeness was examined
by comparing the model fit of the base model with one that included a
fixed effect of Englishlikeness plus interactions with all time terms.
After examining the effect of Englishlikeness, we assessed whether
accuracy on the orthographic word learning test was further predicted
by individual difference measures of cognitive and linguistic abilities (i.
e., non-verbal IQ, Simon effect, Simon inhibition, English reading pro
ficiency, English vocabulary size, phonological working memory) and
Colbertian letter knowledge (i.e., performance on the novel word
recognition and production tasks). Effects of individual difference
measures were evaluated in separate models that included fixed effects
of the individual difference measure, Englishlikeness, the time terms,
and all two-way interactions, plus random effects of participant on all
time terms. Models were fit using maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE), which seeks to maximize the likelihood that the estimated pa
rameters would produce the observed data (represented by the likeli
hood function; L()). Model fit can be determined by taking twice the
negative log of the likelihood function (i.e., - 2LogLikelihood), with
smaller values indicating better model fit (common metrics of model fit
such as the corrected Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are estimated using - 2LogLikeli
hood). The significance of each fixed effect was assessed using a Chisquare test on - 2LogLikelihood change in model fit (between a model
with and without the fixed effect), and parameter-specific p-values were
estimated by using a normal approximation, treating the t-value from
the model as a z-value (See Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013).

2.1.4. Data analysis
The primary outcome of interest was accuracy over time on the word
learning: orthography task - that is, the rate and extent to which partic
ipants successfully learned to associate Colbertian spoken words with
their orthographic forms. In order to capture the maximal learning
window across participants, we analyzed performance up to the average
criterion point (i.e., blocks 1-10). The change in accuracy over time in
orthographic word learning was analyzed using growth curve analysis
(Mirman, Dixon, & Magnuson, 2008; Mirman, Magnuson, Graf Estes, &
Dixon, 2008), a technique specifically designed to assess change over
time. Growth curve analysis is a form of multilevel regression that
simultaneously estimates the effects of individuals (e.g., differences in
mean accuracy and rate of learning across participants) and of experi
mental manipulations (e.g., Englishlikeness) on timecourse data. The
curve or best-fit line characterizing each participant's trajectory of
learning over time was first estimated in a base level-1 model using
second-order orthogonal polynomials (i.e., intercept, linear, and
quadratic time terms). The intercept captures overall levels of accuracy,
the linear term characterizes the slope or rate of learning over time, and
the quadratic term describes the rise and fall in accuracy around a
central inflection point in the learning curve.
Effects of word-level factors (Englishlikeness) or participant-level
factors (cognitive profile, word generalization skill) on each of these
parameters were then assessed in level-2 models. For instance, an effect
of Englishlikeness on the intercept would reflect differences in the
average height of the curve (e.g., if overall accuracy was higher for lowEnglishlike than high-Englishlike words). Effects on the linear and
quadratic terms would each reflect changes in the rate of learning over
time, with the linear term indexing the overall slope of the learning
curve across the full time window (e.g., if the overall change in accuracy
from Block 1 to Block 10 was greater for low- than high-Englishlike
words) and the quadratic term reflecting periods of accelerated and
decelerated learning toward the middle of the window (e.g., if rapid
gains were made earlier in the task for low-, but not high-Englishlike

2.2. Results
Participants reached the 90% accuracy criterion in the word learning:
orthography task after an average of ten blocks (M = 10.10, SD = 7.40,
Range [2, 31]), and in the word learning: meaning task after three blocks
(M = 3.05, SD = 0.69, Range [2, 4]). The training was designed to equate
participants on knowledge of the specific trained words, and accord
ingly, accuracy was high in the subsequent cross-linguistic interference
task (Experiment 2), for which participants were asked to identify visual
objects corresponding to previously-learned spoken words (M = 99.6%,
SD = 0.8%, Range [97.9, 100]).
Orthographic word learning was affected by the Englishlikeness
manipulation and by nonverbal IQ, assessed by improvements to model
fit for the growth curve model of word learning over blocks 1-10. The
Englishlikeness factor significantly improved model fit compared to the
base model (LL = 5.89, X2(1, 13) = 11.77, p < .01), with an effect on
the intercept (Estimate = -0.035, SE = 0.011, z = 3.22, p < .01) driven by
decreased overall accuracy for the high-Englishlike compared to the
low-Englishlike items across training (Fig. 2). Of the individual differ
ence measures, nonverbal IQ improved model fit compared to the base +
Englishlikeness model (LL = 5.89, X2(4, 17) = 11.78, p < .01), with
effects on the intercept (Estimate = 0.121, SE = 0.035, z = 3.39, p <
.001) and quadratic terms (Estimate = -0.051, SE = 0.022, z = 2.30, p <
.05). These effects reflected both higher overall accuracy and an accel
erated learning pace for higher IQs; a one SD increase in the standard
score (i.e., 15 points) corresponded to an increase in accuracy of 1.2%
over training blocks 1-10 (Fig. 3, left). Lastly, while the addition of
phonological working memory (digit span) only marginally improved
model fit compared to the base + Englishlikeness model (LL = 4.26,
X2(4, 17) = 8.52, p = .074), parameter estimates revealed a significant
effect of working memory on the linear slope term (Estimate = -0.10, SE
= 0.04, z = 2.42, p < .05), reflecting a shallower learning curve among
those with higher working memory. Specifically, higher working

tasks, including low- and high-similarity novel word recognition, and letter and
whole word production of untrained words. Data points represent mean accu
racy for individual participants.

Given the role of nonverbal reasoning in pattern learning (Brooks
et al., 2006; Kempe, Brooks, & Kharkhurin, 2010), the superior word
learning among those with higher nonverbal IQ may be attributed to
more successful extraction of individual letter-to-sound mappings.
Support for this interpretation was found in the relationship between
nonverbal IQ and Colbertian letter knowledge. There was wide vari
ability in participants' knowledge of Colbertian letter-sound corre
spondences, as indexed by performance in the two word learning: letter
knowledge tasks. In the novel word recognition task, increasing the
similarity of the foils (and thus the letter-sound knowledge necessary to
identify the target) significantly impacted accuracy, from 92.1% in low
similarity (SD = 7.6%, Range = [66.7, 100]) down to 75.2% in high
similarity (SD = 19.1, Range = [41.7, 100], t(19) = 4.55, p < .001, 95%
CI = [0.09, 0.25], d = 1.19). In the novel word production task, word
accuracy ranged from 0 to 87.5%, M = 11.7, SD = 21.0. Letter accuracy
within participants ranged from 0 to 94.8%, M = 45.6, SD = 26.3
(Fig. 4). A linear model regressing novel word recognition onto simi
larity condition (low, high), nonverbal IQ, working memory (digit span),
inhibitory control, English reading proficiency, and English vocabulary
size revealed that, in addition to significantly greater accuracy in the low
than high similarity condition (p < .001; see above), higher nonverbal
IQ was associated with significantly better recognition of untrained
words (Estimate = 0.06, SE = 0.03, t = 2.22, p < .05). Likewise, a model
regressing novel word production onto the individual difference mea
sures revealed that higher nonverbal IQ was associated with signifi
cantly more accurate production of untrained words, both when
accuracy was scored based on production of individual letters (Estimate
= 0.14, SE = 0.06, t = 2.22, p < .05) and of the whole word (Estimate =
0.13, SE = 0.06, t = 2.16, p < .05). No other individual difference
measure affected novel word recognition or production.
To more directly examine the relationship between letter knowledge
and orthographic word learning, four models were constructed to assess
whether the fit of the base + Englishlikeness orthographic word learning
model was significantly improved by adding a fixed effect of 1) highsimilarity recognition accuracy, 2) low-similarity recognition accu
racy, 3) letter production accuracy or 4) whole word production accu
racy. Accuracy in the more difficult High-Similarity condition of the
novel word recognition task significantly improved model fit (LL =
5.79, X2(3, 16) = 11.59, p < .01), with an effect on the intercept term
(Estimate = 0.131, SE = 0.033, z = 3.96, p < .001). In other words, the
ability to spell new (untrained) words based on their phonological forms
was associated with overall greater accuracy on the initial word learning
task. Similarly, letter accuracy in novel word production improved
model fit (LL = 6.02, X2(3, 16) = 12.05, p < .01), with an effect on the

Fig. 2. Orthographic word learning and English similarity. Englishlikeness of
the novel words had a significant effect on the intercept term of a growth curve
model of word learning. Colbertian words that were highly Englishlike (solid
line) were responded to less accurately over the course of training compared to
low-Englishlike words (dashed line), suggesting greater native-language inter
ference during learning.

with greater accuracy and more accelerated rates of learning during training.

lower learning curve, resulting from superior performance at the beginning of
the task combined with relatively modest gains over the course of training.

memory was associated with greater accuracy at the beginning of the
task, but relatively smaller gains over the course of orthographic word
learning (Fig. 3, right). Neither nonverbal IQ nor the digit span measure
of working memory interacted with Englishlikeness, and none of the
other individual difference measures (nonword repetition, English
reading proficiency, English vocabulary size, Simon effect, Simon inhi
bition) approached significance (ps > 0.1).

intercept term (Estimate = 0.125, SE = 0.034, z = 3.62, p < .01) - that is,
the ability to produce new (untrained) words based on their written
forms was associated with better orthographic word learning. Further,
whole word production accuracy improved model fit (LL = 8.05, X2(3,
16) = 16.11, p < .01), with a significant effect on the intercept (Estimate
= 0.130, SE = 0.034, z = 3.85, p < .001) and a marginal effect on the
linear term (Estimate = -0.088, SE = 0.044, z = 2.00, p = .059). In each
case, better Colbertian letter knowledge was associated with higher
overall accuracy during the critical early window of orthographic word
learning comprising blocks 1-10; whole word production accuracy was
also associated with a shallower slope due to reaching ceiling perfor
mance earlier during orthographic word learning1.

pattern emerges - Colbertian words with more Englishlikeness were
harder to learn. This discrepancy can be attributed to interference
caused by conflicting L1 letter-sound correspondences and the stronger
activation of L1 knowledge for words that resemble the native language.
Proficient bilinguals routinely use sublexical cues like letter and
bigram frequencies as indicators of language membership, which helps
inform how the written form should be represented phonologically
(Oganian, Conrad, Aryani, Heekeren, & Spalek, 2015). Similarly, the
novel language learner may initially use statistical cues to language
membership as a way to mark whole word exceptions from L1 phono
logical rules. This kind of whole-word association is particularly com
mon in the case of loan words. For example, common English words of
French origin, including gourmet, bouquet, and ballet, retain French-like
spellings and pronunciations that contrast with English phonological
rules. Because of Colbertian's modest vocabulary of 24 words, it was
possible to learn the novel vocabulary as whole-word exceptions to
English phonological rules. However, because this whole-word
approach does not scale well with increased vocabulary size, eventual
learning of L2 alphabetic mappings is essential. If participants were
given a training vocabulary larger than the 24 words used in the current
study, whole-word learners' acquisition rates may start to decline as
they reach their vocabulary capacity, followed by a transition period of
slow growth during which they pick up the necessary letter-sound
mappings. In contrast, the alphabetic learners who have mastered in
dividual letter-sound mappings are expected to adhere to a consistent
rate of vocabulary growth over time.
Speaking to the potential impact of whole-word vs. alphabetic
learning on acquisition rates, we observed that individual differences in
verbal working memory, nonverbal intelligence, and alphabetic
knowledge had distinct effects on the trajectory of word learning over
time. Higher verbal working memory was associated with better word
learning immediately following the initial exposure phase, but did not
yield benefits beyond the first few blocks of training or for the acquisi
tion of more fine-grained alphabetic knowledge. It may therefore be the
case that the early advantages of higher working memory resulted from
better encoding and maintenance of whole words rather than of indi
vidual letter-sound mappings.
In contrast, we found that higher scores on a nonverbal intelligence
test were associated with increasing gains over the course of testing, and
superior generalization to untrained words. Similar effects of nonverbal
IQ on word learning have been observed in prior studies utilizing pairedassociates learning paradigms (e.g., de Jong, Seveke, & van Veen, 2000;
Krishnan, Watkins, & Bishop, 2017), as well as on pattern-based
learning of orthographic wordforms (Hung, 2012; Ricketts, Bishop,
Pimperton, & Nation, 2011) and grammatical categories (Brooks et al.,
2006, 2017; Kempe et al., 2010). There is additionally evidence that
nonverbal reasoning among children with language impairments is a
strong predictor of language development (Botting, 2005; Stevens et al.,
2000; Stothard, Snowling, Bishop, Chipchase, & Kaplan, 1998; Tomblin,
Freese, & Records, 1992) and that better nonverbal reasoning among
adult cochlear implant users is associated with superior word and sen
tence recognition (e.g., Knutson et al., 1991; Mattingly, Castellanos, &
Moberly, 2018; Moberly & Reed, 2019). Though the dynamic relation
ship between language abilities and nonverbal IQ is not yet fully un
derstood, it has been proposed that individuals with higher nonverbal IQ
may be better able to compensate for language difficulties (e.g.,
Snowling, Bishop, & Stothard, 2000; Stanovich, 1993; Stevens et al.,
2000). In the context of the present study, the superior orthographic
word learning among those with better nonverbal reasoning may have
resulted from more efficient extraction of non-native patterns and
stronger encoding of associations between individual letters and sounds.
Further support for the important role of alphabetic knowledge was
found in the close relationship between orthographic word learning and
performance on the word generalization tests. Better recognition and
production of untrained words were each associated with superior
performance on the orthographic word learning task. Each learned letter

2.3. Discussion
Experiment 1 examined how native language typicality and indi
vidual differences in cognitive and linguistic abilities influence the
acquisition of novel vocabulary that conflict with L1 orthography-tophonology mappings. All Colbertian vocabulary utilized English letters
and phonemes in order to isolate the effect of orthography-to-phonology
mappings on learning, independent of perceptual learning. Further
more, the novel words varied in their similarity to English lexical pat
terns, based on a wordlikeness metric consisting of English
neighborhood size and bigram frequency.
First, we observed that the challenges associated with learning novel
vocabulary with non-native letter-to-sound mappings are compounded
for words that orthotactically resemble the native language. Language
users automatically generate the corresponding orthographic or
phonological forms for novel words based on phonological rules
(Johnston, McKague, & Pratt, 2004). Speakers more readily adopt nonnative pronunciation patterns for words that are perceived to be of
foreign origin, such as city names (Fitt, 1995), and here we show that
this pattern of L1 similarity also affects non-native phonological
decoding during learning.
Novel written or spoken words with high L1 form overlap are
generally easier to learn than those with low form overlap when
orthography-to-phonology conflict is not manipulated (Roodenrys &
Hinton, 2002; Storkel, Armbruster, & Hogan, 2006; Thorn & Frankish,
2005). For instance, Storkel et al. (2006) observed that after Englishspeaking adults were presented with pairs of nonwords and novel ob
jects embedded in a story, nonwords with a higher number of phono
logical English neighbors were recalled with significantly greater
accuracy than words with fewer neighbors. Likewise, studies utilizing
story-based paired-associates have found that higher neighborhood
density and biphone frequency facilitates children's acquisition of
nonword object labels (Storkel, 2001, 2003, 2004; Storkel & Maekawa,
2005; Storkel & Rogers, 2000). Neighborhood density and biphone
frequency have also been shown to influence serial recall, with superior
memory for nonwords with more native-like forms (e.g., Gathercole,
Clive, Frankish, Pickering, & Peaker, 1999; Roodenrys & Hinton, 2002;
Thorn & Frankish, 2005). The advantages of native language typicality
are likely to stem from the increased activation of L1 lexical and/or
sublexical representations. For instance, it has been proposed that
activating a greater number of L1 neighbors may facilitate the process of
integrating novel words into the existing lexico-semantic network
(Storkel et al., 2006), as well as the ability to reconstruct degraded
memory traces based on existing lexical and sublexical knowledge
(Thorn & Frankish, 2005). Notably, however, the benefits of greater L1
activation are likely to be contingent on the extent to which existing
representations and rules can be applied to the novel language. When
orthography-to-phonology mappings of non-native vocabulary conflict
with that of the native tongue, as in the current study, the opposite

Fig. 5. Cross-linguistic interference procedure. In each trial, participants heard
a Colbertian word (no orthography was presented) and selected the matching
picture. In 24 competitor trials, the orthographic form of the target (e.g., Col
bertian target /guf/, spelled HANE, meaning ruler) overlapped with the En
glish written form of one of the pictures (in this case, the English word CANE,
/keIn/).

in the novel vocabulary facilitated acquisition of other letters by
reducing the amount of unknown information presented in each trial.
Note that at no point in training were participants told to attend to in
dividual letters or that they would later be asked to generalize to new
words, indicating that letter knowledge may have been an emergent
property of word learning, to a varying degree across individual
learners. Future studies assessing participants' strategy-use and meta
cognitive evaluations of alphabetic knowledge may clarify the explicit
vs. implicit nature of learning letter-to-sound mappings during nonnative vocabulary acquisition.
The ability to generalize language knowledge to new exemplars is
critical to expanding vocabulary and incidental word learning. The
current study illustrates the challenges encountered by learners when
their experience is with two languages that actively conflict, as is
sometimes the case for mappings between orthography and phonology.
Though participants in the current study all mastered the Colbertian
vocabulary to criterion, individual differences were observed in their
ability to generalize to novel wordforms. This finding suggests that
learners do not necessarily obtain knowledge of conflicting mappings in
the course of learning and that in some cases, explicit instruction may be
necessary and beneficial (Bitan & Karni, 2003; Brennan & Booth, 2015;
Brennan, 2014).
Because many world languages share orthographic units but differ in
how they use orthography to represent phonological information, for the
language learner, navigating these differences is an important step in
achieving L2 proficiency. Identifying how previous experience with
letter-to-sound mappings in the native language impacts acquisition and
processing of novel letter-sound mappings provides insights into the
architecture of the language system.

with the target /guf/, spelled HANE (High-Englishlike) or competitor
picture of a RAKE, which overlaps with the target /huwi/, spelled RAKO
(Low-Englishlike)). The goal was to measure whether participants fixate
L1 orthographic competitors more than non-overlapping pictures in a
display when hearing L2 words, in order to examine whether non-native
spoken words can simultaneously activate orthography in the native
language.
3.1. Methods
3.1.1. Participants
The same participants took part in Experiment 2 as in Experiment 1.
3.1.2. Materials
Because each Colbertian word was created by substituting one letter
of an English word, each Colbertian word had an English orthographic
neighbor with no phonological overlap. For example, the Colbertian
word HANE, pronounced /guf/, is an orthographic neighbor of the
English word CANE, pronounced /keIn/. This high degree of ortho
graphic overlap with no phonological similarity is rare in natural lan
guage pairs, and allowed us to isolate the effect of dual-language
orthography on auditory processing in a visual world task. A Colbertian
word (target), its neighbor (orthographic competitor), and two nonoverlapping filler words comprised a single test set; black and white
line drawings were selected to pair with each word in a set. Pictures
were highly recognizable, with English naming consistencies above 80%
in either the International Picture Naming Project database (Bates et al.,
2003), or production norms (N = 20) collected from university students
and Amazon's Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com). English
picture names of the three object types (target, competitor, filler) did not
differ in neighborhood size (CLEARPOND, Marian et al., 2012), lexical
frequency (SUBTLEXUS, Brysbaert & New, 2009), or concreteness,
imageability, or familiarity (MRC Psycholinguistic Database, Coltheart,
1981) (all ps > 0.05).

3. Experiment 2: Cross-linguistic Co-activation
To investigate cross-modal effects on novel word processing, we
tracked participants' eye movements using a visual world search task
conducted with the newly-learned vocabulary. After mastering the novel
vocabulary, participants listened to auditory Colbertian words and
identified their matching pictures in a visual display. In competitor
trials, the English name of one of the pictures overlapped orthographi
cally with the target (e.g., competitor picture of a CANE, which overlaps

Fig. 7. Fixations to competitor and filler locations from - 250 ms to 750 ms when the competitor was present (left) and absent (right). When competitors were
present, participants were more likely to fixate the locations of cross-linguistic orthographic competitors (e.g., competitor CANE for target /guf/ spelled HANE, solid
line and black circles) than non-overlapping filler pictures (dashed line and white circles) in a display. In contrast, when competitors were absent (control trials),
participants made similar fixations to controls and fillers. Circles mark observed data, lines are best fit fourth-order growth curve models, and zero time indicates
target word onset.

3.1.3. Procedure
The visual world search task used eye tracking to assess co-activation
of native and non-native orthography during Colbertian spoken word
processing. Eye movements in the visual world task were recorded with
an SR Eyelink 1000 eye tracker, at 1000 Hz. Each trial began with a
1000 ms fixation cross in the center of the screen. Then four pictures
were displayed in the corners, and after a 500 ms delay the Colbertian
target was played over headphones (the orthographic form was never
shown in the task). Participants clicked the matching target as quickly
and accurately as possible with no feedback provided. In 24 experi
mental trials (Fig. 5), one of the pictures was an English orthographic
competitor (e.g., competitor CANE for the target /guf/, spelled HANE).
Note that competitors did not overlap phonologically with the target,
allowing us to isolate the effect of orthographic overlap during spoken
word processing. Experimental trials were intermixed with 24

manipulation, in which no picture names overlapped orthographically
or phonologically with the target.

display, a linear term, capturing the overall slope of fixations across the
entire time window, a quadratic term characterizing the rise and fall of
fixations around a central inflection point in the middle of the window,
and cubic and quartic terms, respectively capturing asymmetric and
symmetric effects toward the tail ends of the window. Additional models
added a fixed effect of object type (Competitor vs Filler) to each time
variable in turn, and change in model fit was assessed using a Chi-square
test. Parameter-specific p-values were obtained using the Satterthwaite
approximation for degrees of freedom. All models included random ef
fects of participant on all time terms.
3.2. Results
The visual world search task assessed native and non-native ortho
graphic interactions during Colbertian auditory word processing. Visual
fixations to all objects in the display increased 250 ms after display onset
as participants scanned the scene prior to onset of the auditory word (the
auditory target was announced 500 ms after display onset) (Fig. 6).
Fixations to the target picture during this preview period increased more
than to filler pictures, a consequence of expectations that may have been
developed during training (although participants viewed target, filler,
and competitor pictures during picture-word learning, Colbertian word
labels were only learned for target pictures).
The effects of target viewing and spoken word comprehension on
activation of L1 orthographic competitors were assessed using growth
curve analysis. Visual fixations to competitor and filler objects in the
display were analyzed from - 250 ms pre word onset to 750 ms post
word onset (Fig. 7, left). The base fourth-order polynomial time model
was significantly improved by adding an effect of Object Type (ortho
graphic competitor vs filler) (LL = 11.43, X2(5, 41) = 21.42, p < .001).
Object Type had significant effects on the intercept (Estimate = 0.024,
SE = 0.005, z = 4.60, p < .001), linear (Estimate = -0.071, SE = 0.027, z
= -2.58, p < .05) and cubic terms (Estimate = 0.066, SE = 0.021, z =
3.12, p < .01). These results indicate that participants viewed compet
itor pictures more than fillers, and that competitor fixations peaked
early, and then decreased to the filler baseline in the latter half of the
window. The difference in competitor and filler fixations prior to word
onset suggests that the visual stimuli alone activated orthography in

3.1.4. Data analysis
Eye tracking fixations were also analyzed using growth curve anal
ysis, which allowed us to examine the overall proportion of visual fix
ations to competitor and filler objects in the display, as well as
differences in the rise and fall of fixations over time (Mirman et al.,
2008; Mirman et al., 2008). For each participant, we began by calcu
lating the proportion of fixations that were made to competitor and filler
objects at each 50 ms time bin between 250 ms pre word onset (at which
point participants began fixating objects in the display) until 750 ms
post word onset (at which point fixations to the target peaked, corre
sponding to final target selection). Fixation proportions were calculated
by summing the number of fixations that were made to competitors or
fillers within each time bin and dividing by the total number of fixations
that were made during that time. Fixation proportions for fillers were
averaged across the two filler objects in the display. The base linear
mixed-effects regression model included fourth-order orthogonal poly
nomials that each characterized distinct components of the fixation
curve. These included an intercept, which captured the average pro
portion of visual fixations to the competitor and filler objects in the

both English and Colbertian.
To ensure that the difference in competitor and filler fixations was
not affected by visual characteristics of the stimuli, we conducted the
same model comparisons in the Competitor-Absent Control trials. Con
trol trials had the same structure as experimental trials, except that
pictures of competitor items were presented in trials where they did not
overlap with the target either orthographically or phonologically. In this
analysis, Object Type did not affect model fit (LL = 3.47, X2(5, 41) =
6.94, p > .1), indicating that participants fixated competitor and filler
pictures similarly when there was no orthographic overlap present
among pictures in the display (Fig. 7, right).
To examine whether the effects of Object Type were moderated by
the wordlikeness of the targets' orthographic forms, an additional set of
analyses were conducted on fixations of High- and Low-Englishlike
items. The base fourth-order polynomial time model included fixed ef
fects of all time terms plus random effects of item on all time terms. The
base model was significantly improved by adding fixed effects of Object
Type (orthographic competitor vs filler), Englishlikeness (high vs low),
and their interaction (LL = 13.30, X2(15, 51) = 26.61, p < .05).
Removing the effect of Object Type from the full model significantly
reduced model fit (LL = 9.50, X2(10, 51) = 19.08, p < .05), indicating
that competitors were fixated more than fillers when controlling for
Englishlikeness. Removing the effect of Englishlikeness from the full
model led to a marginal reduction in model fit (LL = 8.50, X2(10, 51)
= 17.12, p = .072). Parameter estimates revealed a significant Object
Type x Englishlikeness interaction on the quadratic time term (Estimate
= -0.13, SE = 0.05, t = -2.45, p < .05). Separate analyses of trials with
High- and Low-Englishlike targets revealed no significant effects of
Object Type for targets with High-Englishlike written labels (ps > 0.05),
but significant effects of Object Type on the intercept (Estimate = 0.032,
SE = 0.015, z = 2.17, p < .05) and quadratic terms (Estimate = -0.117,
SE = 0.042, z = -2.82, p < .01) for targets with Low-Englishlike written
labels (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that activation of spoken words'
written forms varies as a function of initial word learning. Because LowEnglishlike words were learned better than High-Englishlike words
during initial acquisition, fixations to Low-Englishlike competitors were
greater than to High-Englishlike competitors during subsequent spoken
word processing.

3.3. Discussion
In a spoken word comprehension task using eye tracking, we
observed cross-linguistic orthographic interference from native lan
guage orthography-to-phonology mappings when listening to nonnative words. Pictures in a visual display led to co-activation of corre
sponding English and Colbertian word forms. For example, auditoryonly presentation of the novel word /huwi/, which is spelled RAKO in
Colbertian, resulted in increased visual fixations to a picture of a rake
(because of the orthographic overlap between the Colbertian RAKO and
English RAKE and despite different pronunciations), even though no
orthographic input was present. Because RAKE does not overlap with
any properties of the auditory input itself, this pattern can only be
observed if the spoken word activates its corresponding non-native
orthographic form, which then spreads activation to similarly-spelled
words in the native language.
Despite differences in orthography-to-phonology mappings across
native and non-native vocabulary in the current study, orthographic
forms in both English and Colbertian became activated, resulting in
increased eye movement fixations to English competitors. This finding is
consistent with previous research reporting that orthography within and
across languages influences spoken word comprehension at early stages
of processing (Hoshino & Thierry, 2011; Perre & Ziegler, 2008).
Notably, we found that competitor fixations exceeded filler fixations
even prior to the onset of the spoken target, indicating that both native
and non-native orthographic labels can be co-activated in response to
objects' visual forms.
Interestingly, we observed stronger activation of novel words' writ
ten forms when they were orthotactically less typical of native language
words. This effect of Englishlikeness may be due to the superior learning
of Low-Englishlike words during the acquisition stage (Experiment 1).
While overt exposure to native-like written words is likely to increase L1
activation (e.g., from HANE to CANE), potentially resulting in greater
interference and slower learning, the activation of a spoken word's
orthography based on novel letter-sound mappings (e.g., from /guf/ to
HANE) is likely to be contingent on how well the non-native vocabulary
was learned.
In sum, the observed pattern of results suggests high interactivity
across lexicons and modalities during non-native word processing and

graphic forms. Competitor (solid line and black circles) and control (dashed line and white circles) fixations did not significantly differ for targets with highEnglishlike orthographic forms (e.g., HANE). In contrast, participants were more likely to fixate the locations of cross-linguistic orthographic competitors than
non-overlapping filler pictures in response to targets with low-Englishlike orthographic forms (e.g., ROKA). Circles mark observed data, lines are best fit fourth-order
growth curve models, and zero time indicates target word onset.

demonstrates that native language orthography and orthography-tophonology mappings are activated during the spoken processing of
non-native vocabulary. Finding co-activation both across lexicons
(native and non-native) and across modalities (auditory and visual) re
veals a language system that is highly interactive and suggests a highly
interconnected linguistic architecture.

difficulty learning words with conflicting letter-to-sound mappings. ERP
measures may additionally shed light on the underlying mechanisms, for
instance by confirming whether native language interference is pre
dicted by individual and cross-linguistic differences in graphemephoneme conversion (indexed by the N320) at different stages of
learning. Evidence of greater grapheme-phoneme conversion during
initial exposure to non-native words is likely to be correlated with the
activation of competing native language phonemes, and in turn, slower
acquisition of the novel words and mappings. Greater graphemephoneme conversion at later stages of learning, on the other hand,
may reflect phonological activation based on either native or non-native
rules. To the extent that deeper non-native alphabetic knowledge fa
cilitates word learning, we should find that increased phonological
mediation is associated with slower learning in the case of the former (i.
e., activation based on native language mappings), and faster learning in
the case of the latter (i.e., activation based on non-native mappings).
The use of electrophysiological measures in future research could
inform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the superior
acquisition of words with less typical native language forms. One pos
sibility is that the advantage for less Englishlike words stemmed from
reduced activation of English language knowledge (i.e., its letter-tosound mappings). Alternatively, it may be the case that reduced simi
larity to English minimized reliance on English language strategies.
Simon et al. (2006) found that Arabic-French bilinguals relied on
grapheme-phoneme conversion to a greater extent when making lexical
decisions in French (a language with relatively consistent letter-sound
mappings) than in Arabic (for which the same letter often has multiple
different pronunciations). In other words, while the relative lack of
orthographic transparency in Arabic may have initiated more lexicallybased processing of Arabic words (wherein semantic information is
accessed directly from orthographic wordforms), individuals switched
to a more phonologically-mediated strategy when processing more
orthographically transparent French words. Given that, unlike English
words, the Colbertian vocabulary had consistent letter-to-sound map
pings, a reduction in orthotactic similarity to English may have facili
tated Colbertian grapheme-phoneme conversion (as opposed to whole
word processing). Greater phonological decoding based on non-native
mappings could have contributed to deeper alphabetic knowledge and
superior word learning. To the extent that the low-typicality advantage
stems from reduced activation of conflicting L1 letter-to-sound map
pings, we should see that better learning of less nativelike words is
mediated by a reduction in grapheme-phoneme conversion (i.e., smaller
N320 amplitudes). If the low-typicality advantage instead results from
reduced reliance on inefficient native language strategies (e.g., lexicallybased processing of low transparency words), we should observe that
better learning of less nativelike, orthographically-transparent words
will be mediated by increased grapheme-phoneme conversion (i.e.,
larger N320 amplitudes).

4. Limitations and future directions
Languages often differ from each other in aspects ranging from
sublexical properties to pragmatic use. Laboratory-created linguistic
stimuli provide a useful means of isolating variables of interest with a
level of precision that cannot be obtained with natural language stimuli.
While evidence suggests that similar cognitive and neural processes are
recruited to process natural and artificial language input, including
nonwords as in the present study (Ettlinger, Morgan-Short, FarettaStutenberg, & Wong, 2016; Friederici, Steinhauer, & Pfeifer, 2002; see
Hayakawa, Ning, & Marian, 2020 for a review), we note that the
generalizability of the present findings should be confirmed in future
studies incorporating more complex, naturalistic stimuli.
For instance, while the present study was designed to test for the
impact of conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings while con
troling for difficulties associated with the acquisition of novel letters and
sounds, it is likely that native language activation and interference
during natural language processing would be moderated by familiarity
with the novel words' sublexical information (see Ziegler & Goswami,
2005). Additionally, unlike the artificial vocabulary used in the present
study (for which the sounds of each letter maximally differed from that
of the native language), natural language pairs include both distinct and
overlapping features. The inability to globally disregard existing lan
guage knowledge may therefore contribute to even greater interference
during the acquisition of natural languages. The results of the present
study are therefore likely to provide a conservative estimate of native
language influence during non-native vocabulary acquisition. Indeed,
our finding that the challenges associated with conflicting mappings are
exacerbated for words that orthotactically resemble the native language
speaks to the variable competition that can emerge depending on the
extent of native and non-native similarity. The fact that evidence of
native language co-activation and interference was found despite the
potentially easier task of globally suppressing L1 mappings speaks to the
degree of interactivity within the linguistic system.
Similarly, there is reason to expect that the present findings obtained
with English speakers may reflect a lower level of native language
interference than might be found with speakers of other languages.
According to dual-process models of visual word recognition, a written
word's meaning can be accessed both through direct activation of se
mantics from orthography, as well as via phonological mediation,
whereby graphemes activate corresponding phonological representa
tions before further lexical processing (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Lang
don, & Ziegler, 2001; Harm & Seidenberg, 2004). Neurophysiological
correlates of grapheme-phoneme conversion (e.g., the N320 ERP
component; Bentin, Mouchetant-Rostaing, Giard, Echallier, & Pernier,
1999) indicate that speakers of highly orthographically-transparent
languages are more likely to rely on sublexical phonological mediation
during written word processing than speakers of less transparent lan
guages (Simon, Bernard, Lalonde, & Rebai, 2006). Given that English is
characterized by a notably low degree of orthographic transparency, the
interference caused by L1 grapheme-phoneme conversion is likely to be
greater for speakers of more transparent languages. This hypothesis
could be evaluated in future studies by observing whether speakers of
more orthographically transparent languages experience greater

5. Conclusions
Using carefully designed artificial vocabulary and eye-tracking
methodology, we were able to take a closer look at the interactivity in
the language system, including the variables that moderate the extent of
native language interference during non-native word learning and pro
cessing. Our findings suggest that individual differences and linguistic
characteristics predict acquisition of novel orthography-to-phonology
mappings. Critically, the results demonstrate for the first time that
both native and non-native orthography-to-phonology mappings are
activated during auditory processing of non-native words.
In sum, the study generated two sets of main findings. The first (from

11

V. Marian et al.

Brain and Language 223 (2021) 105045

Experiment 1) is that conflicting L1 letter-to-sound mappings impacted
non-native word learning, to varying degrees depending on individual
differences in cognitive abilities and on characteristics of the word
stimuli. Novel words with more native-language-like orthographic forms
were harder to learn, likely due to increased competition from con
flicting L1 letter-to-sound mappings. Word learning was predicted by
individual differences in nonverbal intelligence. Based on prior findings
that nonverbal intelligence facilitates extraction of novel patterns and
regularities, we propose that the word learning advantage associated
with higher IQ likely stems from more efficient acquisition of non-native
orthography-to-phonology mappings. Support for this interpretation
comes from our finding that individuals with higher IQ were also more
successful at generalizing non-native mappings to the recognition and
production of previously unseen novel words, which was in turn asso
ciated with superior acquisition during formal training. Individual dif
ferences in nonverbal reasoning may therefore be especially likely to
translate to individual differences in pattern-based learning of novel
linguistic features. While we found that individual differences in verbal
working memory predicted learning during the earliest stages of
acquisition, the advantages of better short-term memory declined over
the course of training and did not extend to knowledge of individual
letter-sound pairings (as assessed by the generalization tasks). We
therefore suggest that nonverbal IQ and verbal working memory have
distinct effects on the trajectory of word learning.
The second, most novel set of findings (from Experiment 2) is that
both native and non-native orthography-to-phonology mappings were
co-activated when hearing the non-native words, as well as when
viewing the visual objects prior to the onset of the spoken word. We
conclude that the cross-linguistic co-activation of native language
orthography when hearing non-native words indicates simultaneous
activation of both native and new orthography-to-phonology mappings
during spoken word processing. These findings suggest a cascading
sequence of spreading activation - from phonology to orthography and
across the two orthographic systems - and demonstrate that spoken
word recognition is a dynamic process, where lexical alternatives that
are several steps removed from the auditory input can affect target word
processing (Marian, 2023). Such cascading activation is a testament to
the dynamic interactivity across languages and modalities in the human
mind.
