Purpose: To explore the phonological awareness skills of deaf children with cochlear
implants (CIs) and relationships with vocabulary and reading development.
Method: Forty-three deaf children with implants who were between 5 and 15 years of
age were tested; 21 had been implanted at around 2.5 years of age (Early CI group),
and 22 had been implanted at around 5 years of age (Late CI group). Two control
groups--a deaf hearing aided group (16 children) and a typically developing group
of hearing children (19 children)--were also tested. All children received a battery
of phonological processing tasks along with measures of reading, vocabulary, and
speechreading. Analyses focus on deaf children within the normal IQ range (n = 53).
Results: Age at cochlear implantation had a significant effect on vocabulary and
reading outcomes when quotient scores were calculated. Individual differences in age
at implant, duration of fit, phonological development, vocabulary development,
auditory memory, visual memory, and speech intelligibility were all strongly
associated with progress in reading for the deaf implanted children. Patterns differed
somewhat depending on whether quotient scores or standard scores were used.
Conclusions: Cochlear implantation is associated with development of the oral
language, auditory memory, and phonological awareness skills necessary for
developing efficient word recognition skills. There is a benefit of earlier implantation.

ochlear implantation offers access to auditory information about
speech that has been previously unavailable to profoundly deaf
children. Cochlear implants (CIs) work by transmitting information about the amplitude envelope at a reduced number of frequency channels. Although this reduced information omits fine time structure cues to
phonetic structure, deaf children can use these envelope cues to recognize
speech quite effectively (e.g., Connor & Zwolan, 2004; Nicholas & Geers,
2006; O'Donoghue, Nikolopoulos, & Archbold, 2000). Recently, work with
children with developmental dyslexia and with speech and language
impairments has shown that amplitude envelope cues are very important
to developing high-quality phonological representations of speech (e.g.,
Corriveau, Pasquini, & Goswami, 2007; Goswami et al., 2002; Richardson,
Thomson, Scott, & Goswami, 2004). This raises the possibility that the
information about the amplitude envelope delivered by CIs may enable
deaf children to develop phonological representations that are effective
in supporting the acquisition of reading. In hearing children, the relationship between individual differences in phonological representation
and individual differences in reading attainment has been widely documented (e.g., Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, & Seidenberg, 2001).

If cochlear implantation is able to support the development of high-quality phonological representations by
deaf children, then this should have an impact on their
reading development. The development of high-quality
phonological representations in hearing children is usually measured by phonological awareness tasks, which
assess the phonological aspects of children's lexical representations at the linguistic levels of the syllable, rhyme,
and phoneme.
It is at least plausible to suggest that access to the
amplitude envelope of speech is likely to have important
educational implications for deaf children. In a seminal
study, Conrad (1979) noted that the average achievement for the deaf child leaving school was a reading age
of 9 years. This level does not represent functional literacy. In fact, Conrad noted, "I it is hard to believe that it
will be dispelled even by the most radical improvements
in teaching methods I conceivable within the framework of current theoretical and technical knowledge"
(p. 69). CI technology, rather than radical improvements
in teaching, does seem to offer this possibility. First, the
speech perception information that CIs provide should
aid the development of phonological representations; second, improved speech perception seems likely to enhance
the development of language skills more generally, with
additional consequent benefits for literacy. Indeed, a number of studies of implanted children have shown that both
speech perception and language skills are enhanced by
cochlear implantation (Geers, 1997; Houston, Pisoni, Kirk,
Ying, & Miyamoto, 2003; Richter, Eissele, Laszig, &
Loehle, 2002; Stacey, Fortnum, Barton, & Summerfield,
2006; Svirsky, Robbins, Kirk, Pisoni, & Miyamoto, 2000;
Tyler et al., 1997). For example, regarding speech perception, Tyler et al. (1997) measured the performance of
50 children who had used their CI for 2 years. Tyler et al.
reported that most children showed improvements in
speech perception, although there were large individual
differences. Stacey et al. (2006) found that implantation
was associated with significant enhancement of auditory
performance and speech perception in their cross-sectional
questionnaire study of hearing impaired children in the
United Kingdom. Hence, the benefits of cochlear implantation for speech perception are well-documented.
Studies of the language development of profoundly
deaf children with CIs suggest that the rate of language
development exceeds that of other deaf children (Nicholas
& Geers, 2006; Svirsky et al., 2000; Tomblin, Spencer, &
Gantz, 2000). For example, Svirsky et al. (2000) measured the language development of deaf children before
and after cochlear implantation. They found that the implanted children exceeded the predicted rate of development compared with nonimplanted deaf children on
the expressive language measures of the Reynell Developmental Language Scales (Reynell & Huntley, 1985).
Geers (1997) compared implanted children with two

238

groups of hearing aid users, those whose average hearing loss was between 90 and 100 dB, and those whose
hearing loss was greater than 100 dB. She found that the
implanted children performed at an equivalent level in
assessments of speech perception, speech production, and
vocabulary development to the less severely impaired
aided children (those whose average hearing loss was between 90 and 100 dB). However, rates of language development in deaf implanted children are not equivalent to
those of hearing peers (Ertmer, Strong, & Sadagopan,
2003; L. J. Spencer, Barker, & Tomblin, 2003; P. Spencer,
2004).
In addition to the general benefits demonstrated for
cochlear implantation, growing numbers of studies suggest that early implantation carries additional benefits
for speech perception, speech intelligibility, and language development (Geers, Nicholas, & Moog, 2007;
Miyamoto, Kirk, Svirsky, & Sehgal, 1999; Nicholas &
Geers, 2007, 2008; O'Donoghue et al., 2000; Svirsky,
Chin, & Jester, 2007; Tomblin, Barker, Spencer, Zhang,
& Gantz, 2005). For example, Nicholas and Geers (2008)
reported on the spoken language skills of 76 deaf, orally
educated children who had been implanted before the
age of 38 months. They found a linear relationship between age at implantation and test scores on different
preschool language measures, including auditory discrimination, receptive vocabulary, and expressive language.
Geers et al. (2007) reported a similar significant effect of
age at implantation in a different cohort of implanted
children, using receptive vocabulary (Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test--Revised [PPVT-R]; Dunn & Dunn,
1997) as the main outcome measure. They noted that
other predictors, notably preimplant aided hearing threshold and nonverbal IQ (NVIQ), also played important roles
in the predictive relationships. There is some evidence that
the benefits of implantation may level off after a certain
chronological age, between 2 and 3 years (Baumgartner
et al., 2002; Nicholas & Geers, 2007; Sharma, Dorman, &
Kral, 2005). In general, recent studies support the view
that implantation before 2 years is most desirable with
respect to spoken language outcomes (Miyamoto, HayMcCutcheon, Kirk, Houston, & Bergeson-Dana, 2008;
Nicholas & Geers, 2007).
The potential benefits of implantation and in particular early implantation for reading development have
received less attention. In a recent review, Marschark,
Rhoten, and Fabich (2007) suggested that empirical results to date were highly variable and that even though
earlier implantation should be associated with higher
reading achievement, this had yet to be demonstrated
consistently. They noted that many studies have failed
to control for potentially critical variables, such as age of
implantation and consistency of implant use. Connor and
Zwolan (2004) studied a cohort of 91 deaf implanted
children, and they reported that multiple factors affected

the development of reading comprehension skills, including preimplant vocabulary and socioeconomic status.
Nevertheless, age at implantation was found to have a
large effect on reading outcome. Archbold et al. (2008)
recently reported a significant negative correlation between age at implantation and net reading age as assessed by the Edinburgh Reading Test (University of
Edinburgh, n.d.) in a cohort of 71 implanted children
(those implanted earlier had higher net scores). Geers
and colleagues have also carried out a number of studies,
and they have reported that the number of deaf children
achieving age-appropriate reading levels is improving
(e.g., Geers, 2002, 2003; Geers et al., 2002). Geers (2003)
studied a large group of implanted children and found
that the variable most strongly associated with reading
outcome was overall language competence. The second
was speech intelligibility. She also reported that communication mode made no significant specific contribution
to reading variance in the children in her study. Geers
(2002) reported that NVIQ made a significant contribution to variance in reading in children with CIs. In fact,
NVIQ showed a stronger relationship with reading than
other family variables, such as socioeconomic status. In
hearing children, the most important predictor of reading
outcomes is phonological awareness, the child's ability to
reflect on the sound structure of words. Most studies of
deaf literacy have not included measures of phonological
awareness; rather, they have included measures of phonological coding when reading. This is because written
items have been used to assess the potential influence
of phonology on deaf literacy.
Reports from prior research have differed in their
conclusions regarding deaf children's use of phonological coding when reading (e.g., Campbell & Wright,
1988; Carter, Dillon, & Pisoni, 2002; Dyer, MacSweeney,
Szczerbinski, Green, & Campbell, 2003; Geers, 2003;
Marschark et al., 2007; Perfetti & Sandak, 2000;
Transler, Leybaert, & Gombert, 1999; Waters & Doehring,
1990). For implanted deaf children, however, studies do
show significant positive effects. For example, in the comprehensive study by Geers (2003), rhyme skills were measured by using four kinds of written items: similar spelling,
no rhyme (men/man); dissimilar spelling, rhyme (word/
bird); dissimilar spelling, no rhyme (big/school); and similar spelling, rhyme ( year/dear). Geers reported that this
rhyme task was significantly related to reading outcomes
in her implanted group, as were her other measures of
phonological coding (making lexical decisions about homophones, such as werd/word, and digit span tasks). James,
Rajput, Brinton, and Goswami (2008) developed nonorthographic measures of phonological awareness for deaf
implanted children, on the basis of pictures. They found
that nonorthographic rhyme knowledge was significantly
associated with reading development for the implanted
children in their sample (n = 19), as was vocabulary

development. Although the sample size was small, regression analysis showed that 76% of the variability in the
deaf children's reading was explained by three predictors:
NVIQ, rhyme awareness, and receptive vocabulary.
In hearing children, phonological awareness follows
a developmental sequence, with awareness of syllables
developing first, then awareness of rhymes, and finally
(partly via alphabetic learning) awareness of phonemes
(Goswami & Bryant, 1990; Ziegler & Goswami, 2005).
Studies investigating the development of phonological
awareness in deaf children have revealed a similar developmental sequence. For example, Sterne and Goswami
(2000) investigated the phonological awareness of deaf
hearing aided children in a series of experiments exploring syllable, rhyme, and phoneme awareness. The deaf
children were between 9 and 13 years of age and had a
reading age of between 6 and 9 years. Their performance
was compared with that of two groups of hearing children: one of similar chronological age (CA-matched group)
and one of similar reading level (RL-matched group). The
deaf children were above chance in the picture-based tasks
used at all phonological levels tested, but they were only
similar in absolute performance levels to the hearing children in their performance in the syllable task. However,
when making judgments about syllables, they were as
competent as both CA-matched children and younger
RL-matched children. Phonological awareness at the syllable, rhyme, and phoneme levels in deaf children with
CIs was studied by James et al. (2005). In their study,
8-year-old implanted deaf children performed at levels above chance in picture-based tests of syllable and
rhyme awareness, but they were only above chance in a
phoneme awareness test when spelling (orthography)
supported the phonetic judgments required.
To date, speechreading skills have not been systematically assessed in children with CIs with respect to their
literacy development. This is unfortunate. Bergeson,
Pisoni, and Davis (2003) reported that speechreading
skills prior to implantation were the strongest predictor of speech and language outcomes after 3 years of
implant use, suggesting that speechreading is not an
isolated perceptual skill but has important linguistic
consequences. Charlier and Leybaert (2000) have suggested that when visual cues are used to supplement
oral language learning by deaf children, good levels of
phonological awareness can develop. They found that
severe and profoundly deaf children who had experienced cued speech from infancy were able to identify
and produce rhymed pairs of words (called "friends").
This suggests that providing a visual specification of
phonological contrasts, as in cued speech, supports the
development of accurate phonological representations.
Interestingly, Charlier and Leybaert noted that the deaf
children in their study were influenced by speechreading
similarities between the rhyming word pairs. Harris

and Moreno (2006) reported that the good deaf readers
(7-8-year-old children) who they studied were all good at
speechreading and that speechreading skills predicted
the degree of reading lag in the whole deaf group. Kyle
and Harris (2006) also found that speechreading skills
were associated with reading in their sample of mainly
hearing-aided deaf children, along with expressive vocabulary. No associations were found for phonological
awareness.
Overall, prior research with deaf children suggests
that even if cochlear implantation does improve the phonological awareness skills developed by deaf children,
other factors, such as speechreading skills and general
language skills, will continue to be important. Indeed,
success in reading for deaf children seems likely to depend on the successful integration of a number of developmental components, of which the enhanced access to
speech information provided by cochlear implantation is
likely to be only one contributing factor. In the current
study, we therefore set out to investigate the relationships between all these factors (phonological, linguistic,
and visual) and literacy in deaf children fitted with CIs.
Our main research questions were whether cochlear implantation influences the development of phonological
awareness skills, vocabulary skills, and literacy skills in
deaf children, and if so, whether age at implantation has
any additional effect. To investigate these questions, we
compared the performance of a profoundly deaf group of
children with CIs with that of a severely deaf group using hearing aids and a hearing control group of readingage-matched children using a wide range of phonological
awareness measures. We also used a wide range of assessments of reading, a number of memory measures,
and a test of speechreading abilities, as well as an assessment of speech intelligibility. A number of the phonological awareness tasks were novel and were created
especially for this study and a parallel study of adult
deaf reading (MacSweeney, Waters, Brammer, Woll, &
Goswami, 2008).

Method
Participants
Seventy-eight children between 5 and 15 years of
age took part in this study. Of these, 59 children were
deaf, and 19 were hearing. The 59 deaf children were all
prelingually deaf and spoke English as their first spoken
language, although British sign language was the primary language for nine participants. Fifty of the deaf
children attended units in mainstream schools with hearing support; the other nine deaf children attended residential schools. Only five children in the sample were in
total communication educational settings where predominantly sign language was used in teaching.

Forty-three of the deaf children had received CIs
between 19 and 109 months of age.1 The CI children
were between 62 and 178 months of age at the time of the
current study. Twenty-one children formed an early implanted group (Early CI), defined on the basis of an age
at time of implantation younger than 39 months. This
was a convenience definition for partitioning the sample
to give equal numbers in both groups. It is, however,
theoretically interesting, as Sharma, Dorman, and Spahr
(2002) demonstrated a sensitive period for central auditory development before 42 months. Twenty-two children formed a late implanted group (Late CI), defined
on the basis of an age at time of implantation later than
43 months. The 21 children in the Early CI group comprised 14 boys and seven girls between 62 and 163 months
of age. In the Late CI group, there were 12 boys and 10 girls
between 82 and 178 months of age. Participant details for
the whole sample of 43 CI children are given in Table 1.
A t test confirmed that there was a statistically significant difference in age at implantation between the two
groups, t(1, 41) = 8.6, p < .0001. Duration of fit was
broadly similar in the two implanted groups. There was
no significant difference between mean duration of fit,
t(1, 41) = 1.1, p = .30.
Two control groups were recruited. The hearing aided
deaf controls (HA controls; n = 16) had an average hearing loss of between 32 and 96 dB and attended units attached to mainstream schools. Average hearing loss was
available for most children and was calculated from unaided hearing levels at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz.
As shown in Table 1, the mean unaided hearing loss of the
HA control group (71 dB) was less than that of the profoundly deaf CI groups (109 and 106 dB, respectively).
Unaided hearing level ranged between 90 and 117 dB in
the Early CI group and between 93 and 120 dB in the
Late CI group. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
confirmed that for unaided hearing, the HA controls' mean
was significantly higher than the two implanted groups'
means, F(2, 40) = 32.3, p < .001. The HA controls' ages
ranged from 77 to 160 months, with an average age of
119 months, making the group slightly older than the
Early CI group (111 months) but slightly younger than
the Late CI group (132 months). Details of aided hearing
levels were also collected when available. The CI groups'
means were each 35 dB and 34 dB, respectively, and the
HA controls' mean was 35 dB. Aided hearing levels were
not different between the groups, F(2, 41) = 0.17, p = .85.

Thirteen of these children had previously participated in the study reported
by James et al. (2005). These children (eight in the Early CI group and five in
the Late CI group) were at the upper end of the age range for the implanted
groups, but preliminary analyses showed that they did not differ significantly
from the other implanted children in the Early and Late CI groups in any of the
standardized or experimental measures used in the current study, with one
exception. For the British Ability Scales--II (Elliott, Smith, & McCulloch,
1996) single word reading measure, the quotient score was significantly lower
for these 13 children compared with the newly recruited children (0.69 vs. 0.87).

The reading age controls (RA controls) were hearing children from three local schools between 82 and
117 months of age. Because we had a broad age range in
the deaf groups, the RA controls were selected as being
average readers for their age and were matched to the
average reading age range of the deaf groups as assessed
by the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability--Revised
(NARA-R; Neale, 1997). The children composing the
RA controls were selected to have a reading age within
1 SD of the mean given their age.

Participants Used for Main Analyses
As shown by the range information in Table 1, some
of the deaf children were of low IQ. It was therefore decided to restrict the statistical analyses to children whose
NVIQ was 80 or more. Participant details for these 53
deaf children by group are provided in Table 2. NVIQ was
assessed for the deaf groups using the Leiter International Performance Scale--Revised (Leiter-R; Roid &
Miller, 1997). This test was selected because the standardization included deaf and special needs groups and
because the subtests can be carried out nonverbally. The
composite score for the Leiter-R Brief IQ Screen was
used. Fifty-three deaf children met the IQ criterion: 39 in

the CI groups (20 in the Early CI group, 19 in the Late CI
group) and 14 HA controls. The six deaf children with
standard scores below 80 on the IQ screen also participated in the full range of tasks; their data are reported
separately in the Results section. For the 53 deaf participants meeting the IQ criterion, a one-way ANOVA confirmed that there was no significant difference between
the three deaf groups in NVIQ, F(2, 52) = 2.5, p = .10.
Using t tests, we confirmed that age at implantation
still differed significantly for the CI users, t(1, 37) = 9.46,
p < .001. Duration of fit did not differ for the CI users,
t(1, 37) = 0.78, p = .44. Seven of the CI users had British
sign language as their primary language, and four CI
users were being educated in total communication settings. For the hearing children, NVIQ was assessed using the Matrices subtest of the British Ability Scales--II
(BAS-II; Elliott, Smith, & McCulloch, 1996). The mean
Matrices t score for the RA controls was 58 (standardized
M = 50, SD = 10), confirming that they were also an
average-ability group.

Tasks
Psychometric Tests
For deaf children, there are no standardized tests of
reading or vocabulary in British English; consequently,
the standardized tests for reading, vocabulary, and auditory memory were all tests standardized on hearing
populations. Only the visual memory test used had been
standardized on a deaf sample (Roid & Miller, 1997). The
use of psychometric measures standardized on hearing
children raises challenges in terms of administration to
deaf children and interpretation of results (see Lollis &
LaSasso, 2009; Prezbindowski & Lederberg, 2003). For
example, deaf children may have difficulties in assimilating the information required to perform the task, there
are risks of poor communication between child and examiner, and the iconicity of some signs may make it easier for
the deaf child to guess the correct answer for some tasks
(such as the PPVT-R). All assessments were administered
by the first author, a speech and language therapist with
30 years of experience, who has specialized in working
with deaf children. The participants' mothers or educational assistants were also present to assist in understanding the tasks if required.
Tests of reading. We used the NARA-R, which provides an accuracy score and a comprehension score using
passages of text appropriate for children between 6 and
13 years of age. The calculation for rate (speed) of reading was not used. We also used the BAS-II single word
reading subtest and the Wordchains test (Miller Guron,
1999). These tests provided standard scores normed on
hearing children, which were useful for establishing the
absolute level of reading ability of all the participants.
However, raw scores on the reading tests also yielded

242

an age-equivalent score, which was used to calculate
reading quotient scores (Kirk, Miyamoto, Ying, Perdew,
& Zuganelis, 2002). Quotient scores are obtained by dividing the reading age-equivalent scores by chronological
age. A quotient less than 1 suggests delayed development. At all testing sessions, the child's support teacher
(or mother) was present and was able to ensure that the
child understood the task. Sign language was used when
necessary to clarify instructions.
The NARA-R test comprises a series of short texts of
increasing difficulty to be read aloud by the child followed by comprehension questions spoken and /or signed
by the examiner. The text was available for reference when
answering the questions. The BAS-II single word reading
subtest was also used even though it has been dissatisfying
in our previous work, as it had seemed less sensitive to
deaf children's reading achievements. It was included
here to provide comparability with our prior work (James
et al., 2008, 2005). The Wordchains task was included, as
it measures visual word form familiarity, which might be
a strength for deaf children. In the Wordchains test, children were asked to draw a mark between a string of three
or four words to indicate the separate words (e.g., sandcoffeeblue). There was a time limit of 3 min for the test. No
speech was required for this task. Wordchains is therefore
a test of orthographic knowledge. Standard scores were
available for children 7-18 years of age on this test. It
should be reiterated that none of these reading tests are
standardized for deaf children; nevertheless, for comparisons between the deaf groups, this was not expected to
exert any systematic effects on group differences.
Tests of vocabulary. Two vocabulary tests were used
to assess vocabulary development. The British Picture
Vocabulary Scale (BPVS; Dunn, Whetton, & Pintilie, 1997)
is a receptive vocabulary test similar to the PPVT-R.
Children were asked to look at the speaker, to listen to a
spoken word, and then to select one of four black-andwhite line drawings that corresponded with the spoken
word. Because of the possibility of iconicity influencing
the scores, no signing was used to present the target word.
Prezbindowski and Lederberg (2003) commented that
"receptive vocabulary tests such as the PPVT may underestimate deaf children's lexical knowledge because perceptual discriminability of the four choices for each word
has not been controlled" (p. 394). Hence, the data should be
treated with caution. To test expressive vocabulary, we
used the Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test
(EOWPVT; Brownell, 2000). Children named colored
pictures using a noun, verb, or category word. This is an
American test, and thus one item was changed to reflect
British vocabulary: Raccoon was changed to Badger. In
addition, three pictures were changed: a map of America
to a map of the British Isles, an American windmill to a
British windmill, and the symbol for prescription (target
word pharmacy).

Tests of visual and auditory memory. The memory
screen from the Leiter-R was completed by the deaf
groups, and the Digits Forward task from the BAS-II
was completed by all groups. The Leiter-R Memory
Screen assesses visual memory using two picture subtests:
a picture association task and a spatial sequencing task.
Instructions are provided nonverbally. The BAS-II Digits
Forward task (digit span) assesses auditory memory. This
test was carried out orally, and children were asked to
repeat strings of spoken numbers of increasing length.

Experimental Phonological
Awareness Tasks
The experimental phonological awareness tasks
were picture-based to explore the children's own phonological representations of words in their mental lexicons.
All items used are shown in Appendices A-C and were
presented using a laptop computer. The picture pairs
were sequenced in a random order within each task.
Prior to the experiment, the pictures were shown to the
child in a book. They were named and discussed with the
experimenter. This was done to establish that the child
used the intended label for each picture (e.g., van, mouth).
Practice items were administered at the beginning of
each task. In each experimental trial, children were encouraged to name the two pictures audibly and to make a
quick judgment by pressing a "yes" (blue) button or a "no"
(red) button on a button box. The naming check was intended to confirm that the participant was using the correct label when carrying out the judgment task. When a
word was named incorrectly, the experimenter reminded
the child of the correct word.
Rhyme task. In the rhyme task, children were asked to
judge whether two pictures rhymed, for example, walk/
fork. There were 48 picture pairs, of which 24 rhymed. Of
these rhyme pairs, 12 were orthographically congruent
(e.g., leg/peg), and 12 were orthographically incongruent
(e.g., walk/fork). The words used were matched for frequency and familiarity, and they were controlled for
orthographic similarity to prevent the children using
orthographic images of the items as a basis for making
their phonological judgments. Internal consistency as
measured by Cronbach's alpha was good (a = .833).
Initial phoneme task. In the initial phoneme task,
children were asked whether two pictures began with
the same phoneme, for example, swim/circus. The initial
phoneme task used 64 trials, 32 "yes" trials and 32 "no"
trials. The trials were balanced so that half of the "yes" response items had matching initial phonemes and graphemes (e.g., plate/pig), whereas half shared the same
phoneme but had different graphemes (e.g., celery/skirt).
The "no" response pairs were also balanced for orthographic similarity. The words used were again matched
for frequency and familiarity, and they were controlled

for orthographic similarity. The rhyme and initial phoneme tasks were taken from an associated project with
deaf adults (see MacSweeney et al., 2008). Internal consistency as measured by Cronbach's alpha was again
good (a = .785).
Coda task. A coda task using the same forced choice
response format was designed by the first author. Participants were asked to judge whether the final phoneme
of two pictures was the same. The task used 48 picture
pairs based on nouns that were matched for spoken familiarity and frequency. Twenty-four trials had the same
coda, and 24 had a different coda. Speech production
features of the words were considered. There was a balance of front and back vowels in the picture pairs, so that
19 pairs were front vowels (e.g., wheel, leaf ), 17 pairs were
back vowels (e.g., horse, ball), and 12 pairs were contrasted (e.g., train, bone). Seventeen of the pairs included
diphthongs. Lip shape in the 19 front vowel pairs was
spread, and in the 12 back vowel pairs, it was rounded.
The other pairs had a mixed or moving lip shape. The
number of letters in the words was considered. Words had
between three and six letters, with 23 of the pairs having
the same number, 18 differing by one, and six differing by
two in number.

Tests of Speechreading
To explore the effect of visual speechreading skills on
the development of phonological awareness, two sections
of the Test of Adult Speechreading (TAS; Mohammed,
MacSweeney, & Campbell, 2003) were used.
Single word speechreading. The single word speechreading task (TAS word) required participants to watch
a silent video of a face speaking a single word on the computer screen. Participants were then shown a selection
of six pictures and were asked to select the picture corresponding to the target word. There were 15 items in total, presented in random order.
Minimal pairs speechreading. This task was also
taken from the TAS (TAS minimal pairs) and was presented on the computer in the same way as TAS word.
Participants watched a silent video of a single word being spoken and were then given a choice of two pictures
from which to identify the word. The names of the pictures differed by a single phoneme (e.g., ball/bull, winwing). There were 30 items in this task, with three
subgroups of 10 items each. The subgroups contrasted
(a) final phoneme (e.g., dog/doll), (b) initial phoneme (e.g.,
nail/sail), and (c) medial phoneme (e.g., heart/hot).

Auditory Discrimination
This task was based on 32 pairs of spoken words, selected from two of the picture tasks: TAS word and coda.
This was an auditory task presented using live voice but

with no visual cues, and the children were asked to make
a same/different judgment. Word pairs were controlled
for front / back vowel production and for sonority. The
different word pairs incorporated four phoneme-position
changes: initial phoneme (cake/snake), medial vowel (net/
nut), final phoneme (bowl/bone), and open ended versus
closed (cow/mouse). Half of all the words used front vowels (van/fan), and half used back vowels (suit/soup).

Speech Intelligibility
This was based on the Phonological Evaluation and
Transcription of Audio-Visual Language (PETAL; Parker,
1999), using speech samples of natural conversation captured on video during the testing sessions. The PETAL
scale evaluates communication on a scale ranging from
1 to 5. A score of 1 was assigned when the child's speech
was easily understood, and a score of 5 was assigned when
oral speech was difficult to understand. Rating scores were
assigned by the first author, who is a registered speech and
language therapist.

Procedure
The children were seen either at school in a quiet
room or in their home. Assessment was carried out in
1- or 2-day sessions, with breaks between tasks, for example, during a single school day. During the assessment sessions, the phonological tasks were interspersed
among the standardized tests. The order in which the
tasks were given was fixed: BPVS, rhyme task, TAS tasks,
EOWPVT, coda task, BAS-II reading, auditory discrimination, initial phoneme task, digit span, NARA-R, and
Wordchains.

Results
Preliminary analyses were carried out to explore
whether homogeneity of variance assumptions were met
for all tasks. The reading and speechreading tasks all
met homogeneity assumptions, and so one-way ANOVAs
were performed to examine group differences. In the language and phonological awareness tasks, the assumptions of homogeneity of variance were not fully met, and
so Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U nonparametric tests were performed on the data. The RA controls'
mean scores were much higher than the deaf group's
mean scores. All data were examined for skewness and
kurtosis. In the initial phoneme task, one high-scoring
outlier from the Early CI group skewed the data. In this
case, the outlier was not excluded as nonparametric analyses were performed. For each task, our aims were (a) to
explore differences between the CI groups (Early vs. Late),
(b) to compare all the deaf groups (Early CI and Late CI vs.
HA controls), and (c) to compare the hearing and deaf

244

children. An alpha level of .05 was set for all statistical
tests.

Reading Performance
Reading performance for each group is shown
in Table 3. A one-way ANOVA, taking Group as the
between-subjects factor, was performed for each of the
four reading tests. No significant effects of Group were
found, indicating that there were no significant differences between the mean scores of the groups for reading
accuracy, reading comprehension, or Wordchains (orthographic competence): NARA-R accuracy, F(3, 68) = 0.28,
p = .84; BAS-II single word reading, F(3, 68) = 0.93,
p = .43; NARA-R comprehension, F(3, 68) = 0.66, p = .58;
Wordchains, F(3, 60) = 2.18, p = .10. Nevertheless, inspection of the reading age-equivalent scores shows that
reading levels lagged chronological age by a considerable amount for the deaf groups. Mean discrepancies for
NARA-R accuracy were 11 months for the Early CI group,
28 months for the Late CI group, and 24 months for the HA
controls. This is suggestive of better progress in reading
for the Early CI group. The children in the Early CI group
are within the normal range for their age, and they have
comparable reading age-equivalent scores compared with
the children in the Late CI group, who are 21 months
older (recall that duration of fit was equated between the
Early and Late CI groups). The BAS-II single word reading test and the NARA-R reading comprehension measures showed a comparable pattern.
Following Kirk et al. (2002), we therefore calculated
reading quotient scores for the two CI groups by dividing
their reading age-equivalent scores by their chronological age. A quotient less than 1 suggests delayed development. When reading quotient scores were calculated,
quotient scores were found to differ by age at implantation for NARA-R accuracy, t(37) = 2.32, p = .026; NARA-R
comprehension, t(37) = 2.42, p = .020; and BAS-II single
word reading, t(37) = 2.05, p = .048. In each case, the Early
CI group's mean quotient was closer to 1 than the Late CI
group's mean quotient, indicating a developmental trajectory closer to that attained by hearing children (NARA-R
accuracy, 0.91 vs. 0.80; NARA-R comprehension, 0.88 vs.
0.74; BAS-II single word reading, 0.86 vs. 0.76). The mean
quotients for the HA controls were 0.82 (NARA-R accuracy), 0.77 (NARA-R comprehension), and 0.79 (BAS-II
single word reading), suggesting similar attainment to
the Late CI group. Hence, there is a clear benefit of early
implantation with respect to reading development.
Seven of the CI children had reading quotient scores of
1.00 or greater (i.e., had reading ages equivalent to or
greater than their chronological age). Six of these seven
children were in the Early CI group, and all seven were
being educated in an oral setting and used spoken
English as their primary language.

In contrast, the standard scores achieved on the
Wordchains test showed age-appropriate performance
by all of the deaf children, even though the Wordchains
test is also standardized on hearing children. The Wordchains test only gives a standardized score for children who are 7 years of age or older, and so some of the
younger deaf children did not participate in this task
(64 children over the age of 7 years participated, 45 deaf
children participated, and 19 RA controls participated).
The deaf groups achieved a mean standard score of between 94 and 100, thereby all showing performance levels

within the normal range (standard score of 100). As there
was no necessity for the participants to use a phonological
code to carry out the Wordchains task successfully, this
may explain the advantage shown by the deaf children in
this task. However, it cannot be concluded that the deaf
children did the Wordchains task in the same way as the
hearing children.
Given that the deaf and hearing groups were matched
for their absolute levels of decoding skills, reading comprehension, and orthographic knowledge, it is interesting to explore whether there are any group differences

between the deaf and hearing groups in the language,
memory, speechreading, and phonological awareness
skills that are known to be important for the development of reading. We turn to these data next.

Vocabulary Development
For the receptive vocabulary task (BPVS), all three
deaf groups scored below age-appropriate levels, as shown
in Table 4. The BPVS is an auditory task, and therefore it
was a difficult test for our deaf groups. Nevertheless, it is
striking that the discrepancies in language age in months
are much larger than the discrepancies in reading age
in months for the deaf children. For example, whereas
the children in the Early CI group were lagging on average by 11 months in reading attainment with respect to
their chronological age, they were lagging on average by
29 months in vocabulary attainment. The Late CI group
was lagging on average by 28 months in reading attainment but by 57 months in vocabulary attainment,
whereas the HA controls were lagging on average by
24 months in reading attainment but by 52 months in

vocabulary attainment. The RA controls scored at ageappropriate levels. However, the mean differences noted
reflect a wide range of scores within the deaf groups. In
the CI groups, a total of 11 children out of 39 children
achieved scores within the average range on the BPVS--
nine of them in the Early CI group. In the HA controls,
there was one participant whose score was within the
average range. Again, this is indicative of a beneficial
effect of early implantation, and so language quotient
scores were calculated for the two CI groups. The Early
CI group had a mean quotient score closer to 1 than the
Late CI group (means of 0.72 and 0.57, respectively).
Homogeneity of variance assumptions were not met;
hence, the Brown-Forsythe test was used to evaluate
the group difference, which was significant ( p = .045).
Therefore, although receptive vocabulary skills were
significantly delayed for all deaf groups, there was a
vocabulary benefit associated with early implantation.
The mean quotient score for the HA controls was 0.57,
equivalent to the Late CI group.
For the expressive language measure (EOWPVT), performance was actually somewhat better for the children

in the Late CI group and for HA controls compared with
their performance with the receptive vocabulary test.
Nevertheless, performance was still lagging far behind
chronological age, with a discrepancy of 28 months for
the Early CI group, 46 months for the Late CI group, and
44 months for the HA controls. The expressive language
age of the hearing children was on average 16 months
ahead of chronological age. For expressive vocabulary,
language quotient scores did not differ by group. Although there was an advantage for the Early CI group, it
was not significant, t(37) = 1.05, p = .30 (Early CI group's
mean quotient = 0.73; Late CI group's mean quotient =
0.65). The mean quotient attained by the HA control
group was 0.63. Therefore, expressive vocabulary skills
were significantly delayed in the deaf groups compared
with the hearing children, in contrast to their matched
absolute levels of reading attainment.

Memory Development
Visual memory was a developmental strength for the
deaf children in our study. All groups showed mean standard scores on the Leiter-R Memory Screen task at the
typically developing hearing level (see Table 4), and there
were no significant differences by deaf group, F(2, 45) =
1.78, p = .180. Hence, the visual memory skills in our sample were age appropriate. It is possible that these visual
memory skills supported the development of orthographic

knowledge (it will be recalled that performance on the
Wordchains task was also age appropriate).
In contrast, auditory memory skills in the deaf sample
were not age appropriate. The BAS-II Digits Forward test
was carried out by all participants. Nonparametric comparisons were used. A Kruskal-Wallis test showed that
there was a significant difference between the groups,
c2(3, N = 72) = 18.31, p < .001. Mann-Whitney U tests
confirmed that the RA controls' scores were ranked significantly higher than the deaf group's scores (Early CI
group, U = 74.0, p = .001; Late CI group, U = 55.0, p < .001;
HA controls, U = 43.0, p = .001). No significant difference
was found between the scores of the CI groups (U = 164.0,
p = .47) or between the HA controls and the CI groups
(Early CI group, U = 117.5, p = .43; Late CI group, U =
128.0, p = .86). The three deaf groups scored poorly on this
auditory memory test, although this was not unexpected.
As the BAS-II enables an age-equivalent score to be calculated for auditory memory, we also calculated auditory
memory quotient scores for the two deaf CI groups. There
was some indication of a benefit from early implantation
(Early CI group, M = 0.72; Late CI group, M = 0.59); however, this was not significant, t(37) = 1.73, p = .09.

Inspection of Table 5 suggests that the hearing children
did less well on the single word speechreading task than
the deaf children. However, a one-way ANOVA, taking
total TAS word score as the dependent variable, showed
that group differences were not statistically significant,
F(3, 68) = 2.3, p = .09. Performance in the minimal pairs
speechreading task was also compared using one-way
ANOVA, taking the total correct percentage as the dependent variable. Again, there were no significant group
differences, F(3, 66) = 1.70, p = .18. However, in this task,
the position of the phonemes to be contrasted was varied. There were 10 trials each for initial position, medial
position, and final position contrasts. For the 10 items
contrasting initial phoneme position, mean scores were
5.0, 6.0, 6.4, and 6.2 for the Early CI group, the Late CI
group, HA controls, and RA controls, respectively. Group
differences approached statistical significance, F(3, 66) =
2.67, p = .06. The mean scores suggest that the children
in the Early CI group were not as good at reading initial
phonemes from visual cues as the other children. There
were no group differences for medial phoneme position.
Here, the mean scores were 6.6, 6.3, 6.7, and 6.2, respectively, F(3, 66) = 0.45, p = .718. When the final phoneme
position was contrasted, the mean scores were 6.4, 6.9,
7.0, and 5.6, respectively. Here, there was a statistically
significant difference between groups, F(3, 66) = 3.28,
p < .05. Post hoc Tukey comparisons revealed that these
differences were between the RA controls and the Late
CI group ( p = .042) and the HA controls ( p = .049) but
not the Early CI group ( p = .337). This suggests that the
Late CI group and the HA controls were better able to
discriminate between final phonemes using lip and cheek
cues than the hearing children. The Early CI group was in
between. Hence, speechreading skills are significantly
enhanced in deaf children compared with hearing children when information about phonemes must be read
from the face, at least for phonemes in the final (coda)
position. Better speechreading skills may support the
development of phonological representations.

Auditory Discrimination
and Speech Intelligibility
Inspection of Table 5 shows that the deaf children
were impaired in auditory discrimination, as might be
expected. A one-way ANOVA, taking total score as the
dependent variable, showed that there was a significant
difference between the deaf groups and the RA controls,
F(3, 67) = 11.73, p < .001. Nevertheless, the deaf children
were capable of identifying the auditory similarities and
differences in pairs of words in over 70% of the stimuli.
The PETAL rating scores for speech intelligibility are also
shown in Table 5. Rating scores ranged between 1 and 5 in
each of the deaf groups. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on these scale data. There were no statistically

248

significant differences between intelligibility in the deaf
groups, c2(2, N = 53) = 2.68, p = .26. The highest rating of
1 (speech easy to understand) was given to seven children in the Early CI group, two children in the Late CI
group, and four children among the HA controls.

Phonological Awareness
Percentages of correct scores for all experimental
tasks are shown in Table 5. Performance levels that
would be expected given the level of reading attainment
are shown by the typically developing children (RA controls). Percentages are given to enable comparison between phonological awareness tasks. The RA controls
achieved significantly higher scores than the deaf groups
on all the phonological tasks, even though they were
matched to the deaf children for their level of reading
(NARA-R accuracy score). It should be noted that the
deaf children tried very hard in the phonological tasks
and provided considered responses.
A wide range of scores was shown for the rhyme task
among the deaf groups, as can be seen from Table 5. A
Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant difference between the deaf groups and the RA controls, c2(3, N = 72) =
12.67, p < .005. However, the post hoc Mann-Whitney
U test between the Early CI group and the RA controls
did not reach significance (U = 122.5, p = .057). This indicates that rhyme awareness in the Early CI group did
not differ from that attained by younger hearing children with the same word reading skills. The RA controls
differed significantly from the other deaf groups (Late CI
group, U = 83.0, p < .01; HA controls, U = 42, p < .001). No
significant difference was found between the scores of
the two CI groups (U = 149.5, p = .25) or between the HA
controls and the CI groups (Early CI group, U = 107.5,
p = .26; Late CI group, U = 131.0, p = .94).
To investigate whether performance in the rhyme
task was above chance level for the deaf groups, the scores
were converted to z scores using the binomial distribution. Performance significantly above chance was calculated to be 30/48 (64%) correct. Examination of the
z scores showed that the means of both the Early CI group
and the Late CI group were significantly above chance,
with the HA controls just missing (mean group performance 63% correct). For individual children, 12 out of
the 20 children in the Early CI group scored above chance
level, compared with nine children in the Late CI group
and seven HA controls. Hence, around half of the children in each of the latter groups had developed phonological awareness of rhyme. Group comparisons were also
computed when only those children in each group scoring above chance levels were included in the analysis. Now there were no significant differences by group,
c2(3, N = 47) = 2.44, p = .49 (Early CI group = 81% correct;
Late CI group = 79% correct; HA controls = 73% correct;

RA controls = 80% correct). Hence, deaf children who
performed the task consistently were equivalent in
their rhyming skills to the younger hearing controls,
irrespective of age at implant or whether hearing was
aided. This implies that late-implanted children can
also develop rhyming skills that equal those of hearing
children matched for reading age, with the appropriate
support.
Deaf children's performance with initial phonemes
at group level was also poorer than that of the RL controls. Nonparametric tests were again carried out to
compare group mean scores (see Table 5). A Kruskal-
Wallis test indicated a significant difference between
groups, c2(3, N = 72) = 19.40, p < .001. Post hoc Mann-
Whitney U tests showed that the RA controls scored
significantly above all the deaf groups (Early CI group,
U = 58.5, p < .001; Late CI group, U = 66.5, p < .001; HA
controls, U = 34.5, p < .001). No significant difference
was found between the scores of the two CI groups (U =
189.0, p = .98) or between the HA controls and the CI
groups (Early CI group, U = 129.0, p = .70; Late CI group,
U = 125.0, p = .77). A binomial distribution calculation
showed that to score significantly above chance level,
scores greater than 40 were required (40/64 = 62.5%).
Group means were below chance level for all the deaf
groups. However, four children in the Early CI group,
five children in the Late CI group, and four HA controls
achieved above-chance level performance with initial phonemes. In the RA controls, 15 of the 19 children achieved
scores above chance level. Group comparisons were again
computed when only those children in each group scoring
above chance levels were included in the analysis. There
were no significant differences by group, c2(3, N = 28) =
7.69, p = .053. The Early CI group's mean was 70% correct,
the Late CI group's mean was 72% correct, the HA controls' mean was 66% correct, and the RA controls' mean
was 77% correct.
Performance with codas (the final phonemes in syllables) was at a similar level to performance with initial
phonemes and rhymes. A Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant difference between group mean scores,
c2(3, N = 72) = 13.04, p < .005. Mann-Whitney U post hoc
tests showed that the RA controls scored significantly
higher than all the deaf groups (Early CI group, U = 81.5,
p < .005; Late CI group, U = 107, p < .05; HA controls, U =
51.5, p < .01). No significant difference was found between
the scores of the two CI groups (U = 156.0, p = .34) or
between the HA controls and the CI groups (Early CI
group, U = 125.0, p = .60; Late CI group, U = 98.5, p = .21).
Twenty-one deaf children (seven in the Early CI group,
nine in the Late CI group, and five HA controls) and 15
of the hearing children scored above chance level (64%
correct) on the coda task. These data show that performance with codas (final phonemes) is better for deaf children than performance with initial phonemes, in which

only 13 children scored above chance levels. As speechreading skills for codas were significantly better for the
deaf children, speechreading skills may contribute to
the development of phonological representations for codas
by deaf children. Group comparisons were again computed
when only those children in each group scoring above
chance levels were included in the analysis. There were
no significant differences by group, c2(3, N = 36) = 0.86,
p = .84. The Early CI group's mean was 82% correct, the
Late CI group's mean was 83% correct, the HA controls'
mean was 80% correct, and the RA controls' mean was
85% correct. Hence, all deaf children who performed the
task consistently were equivalent in their coda judgment
skills to the younger hearing controls.
In general, therefore, all deaf groups lagged behind
the hearing controls in phonological awareness. Intriguingly, this shows that at the group level, the deaf children's
reading skills have developed to the same absolute level as
that of the younger hearing controls, despite overall depressed phonological awareness and depressed vocabulary
development. This suggests that other developmental factors are contributing to the levels of reading attained by
the deaf children in our study. The data discussed earlier
suggest that speechreading skills and visual memory
skills may be such factors, at least for some of the deaf
children. Nevertheless, some deaf children in each group
had achieved reading-level appropriate scores. We return
to these points in the correlational analyses.

Effects of Primary Language
and Educational Setting
Eight of the 53 deaf participants with IQ in the normal range used British sign language as their primary
language (three in the Early CI group, four in the Late CI
group, and one HA control), and of these eight children,
five were in a total communication educational setting
(two in the Early CI group, two in the Late CI group, and
one HA control). All other deaf participants were in oral
language school settings. To see whether primary language had any effect on the reading and language outcomes, we used quotient scores. There was a significant
effect of primary language for each quotient variable,
with higher mean scores for the oral children: NARA-R
accuracy (0.89 vs. 0.69), t(37) = 3.89, p = .003; NARA-R
comprehension (0.86 vs. 0.63), t(37) = 4.12, p = .001;
BAS-II single word reading (0.85 vs. 0.64), t(37) = 4.29,
p = .001; receptive vocabulary (0.70 vs. 0.40), t(37) = 7.05,
p = .000; expressive vocabulary (0.74 vs. 0.44), t(37) =
4.64, p = .000; digit span/auditory memory (0.69 vs. 0.48),
t(37) = 2.84, p = .013. However, these differences should be
interpreted with caution given the small number of signing children in our sample. To compare performance on
the other experimental measures, we compared mean performance for the signing children and the oral children.

There were no significant differences for any of the measures apart from performance in the rhyme task, t(37) =
3.57, p = .003 (signing children = 53% correct, oral children = 70% correct). The group difference in the auditory
discrimination task approached significance, t(37) = 2.19,
p = .06. The data therefore suggest an effect of oral (phonological) experience on rhyming, reading attainment,
and vocabulary development. We also recomputed all
the analyses reported earlier using the oral deaf children
only, excluding the eight children who used sign as their
primary language. No differences were found. To compare whether educational setting had an effect on development, we computed the mean performance on all tasks
for the two children in the Late CI group who were signers in a total communication setting compared with the
two children in the Late CI group who were signers in an
oral communication setting. There were no significant
differences in any of the measures, with most tasks
showing mean performance levels within 5 percentage
points of each other.

Children Scoring <80 on the Leiter-R
Brief IQ Screen
There were six deaf children who scored below a standard score of 80 for NVIQ on the Leiter-R Brief IQ Screen
who were thus omitted from the analyses reported so far.
These children comprised four implanted and two HA
controls (Early CI group, n = 1, IQ = 79; Late CI group,
n = 3, IQs = 68, 71, and 74, respectively; HA controls, n = 2,
IQs = 70 and 71, respectively). Despite their low cognitive
ability, half of these children--two in the Late CI group
and one HA control--were reading within 1 SD of the expected level of attainment for their age. This implies that
the pattern of relationships for reading, language, and
phonological awareness reported above for deaf children
with average cognitive ability may also apply to deaf
children with lower cognitive ability. All the group analyses described above were repeated when all 78 children
were included in the analyses. Exactly the same patterns of group differences as reported above were found.

Factors Associated With Reading
Development in Deaf Children
The group comparisons reported so far have revealed a benefit of early cochlear implantation with respect to reading attainment (quotient scores), receptive
vocabulary (quotient score), and rhyme awareness. To
explore the relationships between all the different measures and reading development, correlational analyses
were used. For these analyses, age at implant was treated
as a continuous variable. As chronological age was highly
correlated with age at implant (r = .544, p = .000), two sets

250

of correlations were computed. In one set, the standard
scores achieved for reading and language were used,
controlling for age and NVIQ. The standard scores show
the absolute levels of reading and language attainment
reached by our deaf participants, and the factors correlate with these absolute levels of attainment once age
and IQ are taken into account (see Table 6). In the second set of correlations, the quotient scores for reading,
language, and auditory memory were used. As age was
already adjusted in these analyses, only NVIQ was
controlled (see Table 7). As chronological age and age at
implantation are significantly related, age at implantation would only be expected to show effects in the quotient analyses. Partial correlations for the Early CI and
Late CI groups are shown in Tables 6 (age and IQ controlled) and 7 (IQ controlled).
Table 6 shows that, as is usually found in studies of
hearing children, absolute reading attainment was significantly correlated with the vocabulary and phonological awareness measures (rhyme, coda, and phoneme) and
also with auditory memory (digit span). Speechreading
skills at the word level and speech intelligibility also
showed significant associations with the reading and
vocabulary measures (the correlations with speech intelligibility are negative, as a low score on the PETAL corresponds to better performance). As might be expected,
better speechreading skills at the word level and better
speech intelligibility were also both significantly correlated with phonological awareness. Therefore, the associations between speechreading, speech intelligibility,
and reading could be operating via phonological awareness. Visual memory was not correlated with word decoding skills but was significantly correlated with reading
comprehension and orthographic knowledge (Wordchains
task). Unexpectedly, auditory discrimination was not
correlated with the reading, phonological, or vocabulary outcome measures. However, auditory memory was
linked to phonological awareness, vocabulary, and speech
intelligibility.
A second set of correlational analyses (not shown)
explored analogous patterns for the HA controls. There
were few significant correlations, which should in any
case be interpreted with caution as this was a smaller
group. Receptive vocabulary was significantly correlated
with BAS-II single word reading for aided deaf children
(r = .557, p < .05), and expressive vocabulary was significantly correlated with NARA-R reading comprehension (r = .697, p < .01). In addition, speechreading skills
(TAS word) showed a significant correlation with reading
comprehension (r = .533, p < .05) and orthographic knowledge (the Wordchains task; r = .675, p < .05). Auditory
memory was significantly correlated with phonological
awareness (rhyme and coda measures, rs = .662 and .577,
respectively, ps < .05) and with receptive vocabulary (r =
.600, p < .05).

Table 7 shows that when quotient scores were used,
age at implantation was significantly correlated with
NARA-R word reading accuracy and reading comprehension, as well as with BAS-II single word reading.
There was an advantage of early implantation for the
reading measures (significant correlations were negative). Interestingly, with respect to speechreading, the
Late CI group had better skills (significant positive correlation). Duration of fit was also significantly correlated
with BAS-II single word reading, speechreading, and
phonological awareness (rhyme, initial phoneme, and
coda measures). Longer use of an implant was positively
correlated with phonological outcomes but negatively correlated with the BAS-II single word reading measure. This suggests perhaps that the BAS-II is not a very
sensitive measure of deaf children's reading attainment.
In addition, as is usually found in studies of hearing children, NARA-R reading accuracy was significantly correlated with phonological awareness measures (rhyme and
coda awareness) and also with auditory memory. Those
deaf children with better phonological and auditory skills
showed better reading performance. All reading measures were correlated with both receptive and expressive
vocabulary abilities, and with both auditory and visual
memory skills. Apart from the Wordchains measure,
speechreading skills now did not show significant correlations with reading. Speech intelligibility was still
correlated with all the reading, phonology, and vocabulary measures, with the exception of initial phoneme
awareness.
Hence, there are some differences in the factors associated with reading for deaf CI children depending on
whether standard scores or quotient scores are used. In
particular, the phonological processing measures (rhyme,
coda, initial phoneme) show stronger relations to the
reading standard scores (the absolute level of attainment), whereas the age at implantation and duration of
fit measures show stronger associations with the reading quotient scores (the relative level of attainment).
Speechreading skills show stronger associations with
reading standard scores. Vocabulary attainment and
rhyme awareness show strong associations with reading for both quotient and standard scores, as do both
auditory and visual memory and speech intelligibility.
Therefore phonological, vocabulary, articulatory, aural,
and visual skills all appear to support reading development in deaf children with CIs. Articulatory, speechreading, and visual memory skills support reading
attainment in addition to the phonological and language
skills that are associated with reading development in
hearing samples.
A second set of correlational analyses again explored
analogous patterns for the HA controls (not shown), controlling for NVIQ and using quotient scores for the reading, vocabulary, and auditory memory measures. This

was a small sample, and there were few significant correlations. The different measures of reading showed significant correlations with each other, and NARA-R
reading comprehension (quotient measure) was significantly correlated with auditory discrimination (r = -.654,
p = .021) and with speech intelligibility (r = .710, p = .007).
Phoneme awareness was significantly correlated with
auditory memory (r = -.604, p = .029). Reading was not
significantly correlated with either the vocabulary or
phonology measures in this small sample.
Finally, to explore the relative strengths of the different associations indicated in the correlational analyses, multiple regression analyses were conducted for
the CI cohort. In particular, we were interested in the
relative contributions made by phonological awareness
(rhyme awareness, the most consistent associate of deaf
reading) and vocabulary (receptive vocabulary, which
showed stronger associations) to deaf CI reading outcomes. Two series of three-step fixed entry multiple regression equations were computed that varied whether
rhyme awareness was entered before receptive vocabulary or receptive vocabulary was entered before rhyme
awareness. In each case, the dependent variables in
each set of equations were the four reading measures,
using the reading quotient scores for the NARA-R and
BAS-II measures and the standard score for the Wordchains measure (in which deaf progress was age appropriate). The independent variables were entered in a
fixed order as follows: Step 1, NVIQ; Step 2, either phonological awareness (rhyme) or vocabulary (BPVS quotient); and Step 3, the other experimental variables of
theoretical interest. The unique variance accounted for
in each case is shown in Tables 8 and 9.
When rhyme awareness was entered at Step 2 (see
Table 8), it explained between 5% and 39% of unique
variance in reading development, with a particularly
strong contribution to the Wordchains measure--a putatively orthographic measure. Age at implantation still
made a significant contribution to reading development
for all three quotient measures, accounting for between
12% and 16% of unique variance. Duration of fit made an
even larger unique contribution to the reading quotient
measures, accounting for up to 40% of additional unique
variance. Receptive vocabulary accounted for up to 38%
of additional unique variance in each reading quotient
measure, and speech intelligibility also exerted a notable effect, explaining up to 22% of additional unique
variance. Therefore, speech intelligibility makes a contribution to deaf children's reading development that is
independent of its association with phonological development, whereas speechreading does not. When receptive
vocabulary was entered at Step 2 (see Table 9), vocabulary
knowledge explained between 24% and 49% of significant
unique variance in reading, for both quotient and standard
measures (Wordchains). Once receptive vocabulary was

Auditory and visual memory continued to add significant unique variance, explaining up to 11% of additional
variance in reading outcomes. Expressive vocabulary
did not make an additional unique contribution once
receptive vocabulary was accounted for. Overall, the regression analyses suggest a special role for visual memory in the development of reading skills by deaf children
and also for speech intelligibility. In addition, vocabulary development appears to exert a stronger effect than
phonological development, which is the opposite pattern

of that typically found for hearing children. Both speech
intelligibility and phonological awareness of rhyme are
strongly associated with vocabulary development, as
neither accounted for significant unique variance in reading once receptive vocabulary was controlled in the regression analyses.

the development of phonological awareness by deaf children and consequently support their reading development.
The potentially beneficial effects of early implantation for
reading and phonological skills were also of interest.
Profoundly deaf children with CIs (mean unaided hearing levels of 109 [Early CI group] and 106 [Late CI group])
were found to have developed comparable levels of phonological awareness with severely deaf children (mean unaided hearing level of 80 dB for children with IQs >80),
suggesting some evidence for benefit. Furthermore, there
was a clear additional benefit of early cochlear implantation on reading development for the implanted children
and also on receptive vocabulary and rhyme awareness.
Children who were implanted before the age of 3 years
had rhyming skills equivalent to those of reading-level
matched hearing children. They also had reading skills
that were close to being age appropriate (quotient scores
between 0.91 and 0.86) and that were significantly greater
than the quotient scores of the late-implanted children.
The Early CI group also had a significantly higher receptive vocabulary quotient than the Late CI group (0.72
vs. 0.57). However, implantation helped reading and vocabulary development in the Late CI group as well, as
their reading and receptive language quotient scores
were equivalent to those of children who were less deaf
than they were (the HA controls). The children in the Late
CI group were also better at speechreading than the children in the Early CI group.
The benefit of early implantation for reading development is consistent with two recent studies showing an
effect of early implantation on deaf literacy (Archbold
et al., 2008; Connor & Zwolan, 2004), whereas the benefit of early implantation for receptive vocabulary supports a number of prior studies (e.g., Geers et al., 2007;
Nicholas & Geers, 2008). A benefit of early implantation
has also been suggested for speech intelligibility (Svirsky
et al., 2007). Interestingly, when the factors that affected
reading development in the implanted children were
studied using correlational analyses and standard scores,
speech intelligibility and speechreading skills both showed
a significant relationship to reading. Standard scores provide an absolute measure of a deaf child's attainment
compared with a hearing population norm. Speech intelligibility and speechreading were also correlated
with phonological awareness for the implanted children, suggesting that both articulatory skills and the
ability to derive phonological information from lip and
cheek cues help in the development of well-specified
phonological representations by deaf children. When
reading quotient scores were considered, which measure the relative attainment of deaf children compared
with hearing children, these factors were no longer
important. Instead, age at implantation, duration of
fit, and visual memory skills were now revealed to be
important.

For both measures (reading standard and reading
quotient scores), reading development in the CI children
was significantly associated with phonological awareness, auditory memory skills, and vocabulary development. Phonological awareness and auditory memory are
strong predictors of reading development in hearing
samples (Goswami & Bryant, 1990), suggesting that the
developmental trajectory of deaf children who have received CIs is similar to that of hearing children (see also
James et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the deaf CI children
had attained similar absolute levels of word recognition
and reading comprehension to the ( younger) hearing
controls, despite having significantly poorer phonological awareness and auditory memory skills. This suggested that factors in addition to phonology and auditory
memory were supporting reading development for the
CI group. These were found to be speechreading skills,
speech intelligibility, and visual memory. A role for speechreading in deaf literacy was also reported by Harris and
Moreno (2006) and by Kyle and Harris (2006). As suggested by Charlier and Leybaert (2000), the visual specification of phonological contrasts appears to aid the
development of phonological representations.
Similarly, speech intelligibility may be an indirect
measure of articulatory skills, which may help in the development of phonological representations. A functional
imaging study of the phonological system in the deaf
brain (MacSweeney et al., 2008) has shown that signing
deaf adults differ from hearing controls in showing greater
activation of left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) during the same rhyme task used here with deaf children.
This suggests an increased reliance on the articulatory
component of speech when making phonological judgments, which is also found for dyslexic children (Temple
et al., 2003). This raises the possibility that the speech
intelligibility measure used with deaf children is actually an indirect measure of the quality of the children's
articulatory phonological codes. Indeed, apart from the
articulatory differences, signing congenitally deaf adults
activated the same neural systems as hearing controls
during the rhyme task (MacSweeney et al., 2008). This
suggests that phonological processing is supported by a
supramodal phonological system even when language
input differs (speech vs. sign; for detailed discussion, see
MacSweeney et al., 2008). Finally, the deaf children's
visual memory skills are most probably helping the development of the orthographic lexicon. Significant unique
variance in reading comprehension and in the orthographic Wordchains task was still explained by visual
memory skills in the multiple regression analyses, even
after controlling for receptive vocabulary.
Receptive vocabulary development was also found
to be important for reading development in deaf children, consistent with the results of many prior studies (e.g.,
Connor & Zwolan, 2004; Geers, 2003; LaSasso & Davey,

1987; Moores & Sweet, 1990). Overall, therefore, the data
reported here complement the findings of Geers (2003) in
showing a role for both overall language competence and
speech intelligibility in reading development for deaf implanted children. The data reported here additionally
show that early cochlear implantation benefits the development of reading, for both decoding and comprehension, as shown for decoding by Archbold et al. (2008) and
for reading comprehension by Connor and Zwolan (2004).
The data suggest that cochlear implantation enhances
the phonological awareness and auditory memory skills
that contribute to both reading accuracy and reading
comprehension. In addition, articulatory phonology may
play an important role in supporting reading development in deaf children, whereas speechreading skills may
contribute to the development of well-specified phonological representations.
