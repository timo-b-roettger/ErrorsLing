Abstract
The current study investigated the modulation by orthographic knowledge
of the final overlap phonological priming effect, contrasting spoken primetarget pairs with congruent spellings (e.g., `carreau-bourreau', /karo/- / buro/)
to pairs with incongruent spellings (e.g., `zero-bourreau', /zero/- / buro/).
Using materials and designs aimed at reducing the impact of response biases
or strategies, no orthographic congruency effect was found in shadowing,
a speech recognition task that can be performed prelexically. In lexical
decision, an orthographic effect occurred only when the processing environment reduced the prominence of phonological overlap and thus induced
participants to rely on word spelling. Overall, the data do not support the
assumption of early, automatic activation of orthographic representations
during spoken word recognition.

Phonological and orthographic auditory priming

1Introduction
Evidence for orthographic influence on speech processing was reported for the first
time almost 30 years ago by Seidenberg and Tanenhaus (1979). Using a rhyme judgment task, these authors showed that the time taken to decide that two spoken words
rhyme is shorter when their spellings are similar (`toast-roast') than when they are
not (`toast-ghost'), and that the opposite effect holds for negative decisions, which
are faster for `leaf-ref' than for `leaf-deaf'. Since then, many studies have reported
an influence of orthographic knowledge on metaphonological performance, like
in phoneme detection (e.g., Frauenfelder, Segui, & Dijkstra, 1990; but see Cutler,
Treiman, & van Ooijen, 1998), phoneme counting (Treiman & Cassar, 1997), and
blending words into a novel expression (the "blending task" designed by Treiman,
1983, 1986, cf. Ventura, Kolinsky, Brito-Mendes, & Morais, 2001).
More recently, there has been accumulating evidence that knowledge of orthography exerts an influence not only on the way literate people conceptualize speech,
but also on the way they process spoken words in on-line tasks. As a matter of fact,
lexical decision is slower for words including a rime that can be spelled in several ways
than for words including a rime that can be spelled in only one way (the orthographic
consistency effect first shown by Ziegler & Ferrand, 1998), and orthography seems to
modulate formal priming effects (e.g., Chereau, Gaskell, & Dumay, 2007; Slowiaczek,
Soltano, Wieting, & Bishop, 2003).
Such influences of written language on auditory word recognition are surprising,
since speech has primacy over written language both in the history of mankind and in
the life of the individual (Liberman, 1992). According to this logic, written language
processing is viewed as an additional system that may capitalize on existing phonological representations, but orthographic representations are most unlikely to have
any significant impact on spoken word recognition. More generally, the influence of
written language on auditory word recognition seems to question the view that speech
processing is a modular system, encapsulated from the written language system (e.g.,
Coltheart, 1999); most of the influential models of spoken word recognition do not
explicitly consider the possibility that speech processing could somehow be affected
by orthographic knowledge (e.g., Cohort model: Marslen-Wilson, 1987; MarslenWilson & Tyler, 1980; Marslen-Wilson and Welsh, 1978; TRACE model: McClelland
& Elman, 1986; Neighborhood Activation Model: Luce & Pisoni, 1998; Luce, Pisoni,
& Goldinger, 1990; Shortlist: Norris, 1994) and hence should be adapted to somehow
incorporate the influence of orthography. This raises a further issue, namely the
question of the universality of the existing speech recognition models. We already
know that spoken word recognition processes are to some extent influenced by the
varying language phonologies (e.g., Cutler, 1997; Cutler, Mehler, Norris, & Segui,
1983, 1986). Leaving room for the influence of orthographic knowledge introduces an
additional source of variability, including within a particular language, as a function
of the listeners' literacy levels and orthographic competences.
There is however a preliminary problem that should be solved, namely the issue
of the processing level at which orthographic knowledge affects speech recognition,
Language and Speech

and, consequently, of the possibility that it affects spoken word recognition in an
automatic and mandatory way.
As a matter of fact, there is still considerable debate about how exactly orthographic knowledge affects spoken word recognition. In particular, the role of lexical
activation in the occurrence of the orthographic consistency effect is a point of
divergence for the few models that take the influence of orthographic knowledge into
account. Whereas the interactive activation model (e.g., Ferrand & Grainger, 1996;
Grainger & Ferrand, 1994; Ziegler & Ferrand, 1998) claims for bidirectional coupling
between orthography and phonology as a general mechanism that pervades all stages
of speech processing, the partially autonomous and partially interactive account
(Kolinsky, 1998; see also Morais & Kolinsky, 1994; Morais, Kolinsky, & Nakamura,
1996; Morais, Kolinsky, Ventura, & Cluytens, 1997) considers that orthographic
effects only arise when lexical representations are activated, or when decisional
processes about words are at play. In favor of the latter view is the fact that a robust
orthographic consistency effect is observed only in lexical decision (and in this task
only on words, not on nonwords) or when a shadowing response is made contingent
upon a lexical criterion, not in standard shadowing or when the shadowing response
is made contingent upon a formal criterion (Ventura, Morais, Pattamadilok, &
Kolinsky, 2004; Ziegler, Muneaux, & Grainger, 2003).
The aim of the present study was to examine the origin of the orthographic effects
observed in another situation, namely in formal priming. More precisely, we wanted
to check whether these effects automatically arise at a very early processing level.
Contrary to the orthographic consistency manipulation, which involves isolated
words, orthographic effects in formal priming are driven by the congruency between
prime and target spellings (e.g., `bite-kite' vs. `night-kite'; or `phobia-photo' vs. `foamyphoto'). In other words, orthographic congruency seems to modulate phonological
priming effects. This may have important implications for models of spoken word
recognition, since phonological priming effects are supposed to reflect the activation of intermediate representations (e.g., of the rhyme) in the course of the word
recognition process. The influence of orthography on formal priming may thus be
interpreted as an early influence of orthographic knowledge in auditory processing.
However, as we discuss in more detail below, it is important to dissociate the priming
effects reflecting normal speech processing from those reflecting response biases or
strategies, namely controlled attentional processes that listeners use to respond to
the demands of specific listening contexts.
Lack of attention to the distinction between automatic and nonautomatic
processes may explain part of the discrepancy observed in the literature on orthographic effects in formal priming. While facilitation by orthographic congruency
between phonologically overlapping words was observed in some studies (e.g., Baum
& Leonard, 1999; Chereau et al., 2007; Jakimik, Cole, & Rudnicky, 1985; Miller &
Swick, 2003; Slowiaczek et al., 2003), others reported either no such effect at all (e.g.,
Burton, Jongman, & Sereno, 1996) or inhibition due to pure orthographic overlap
(e.g., `couch-touch' vs. `room-touch': Baum & Leonard, 1999; Leonard & Baum, 1997).
These incoherent data may actually reflect differences in the amount and type of
overlap between prime and target that were used in these studies, this factor being

itself highly relevant as regards the distinction between automatic and nonautomatic
processes.
It is a fact that studies on initial phonological overlap (e.g., `talk-tight', `sail-saint')
strongly suggest that the facilitation effect observed when prime and target share
only one onset phoneme is due to strategic processes. These are highly dependent
on task, interstimulus interval (henceforth, ISI), proportion of related items and / or
inclusion of repeated pairs in the experimental list (see data and reviews in Goldinger,
1996; Goldinger, Luce, & Pisoni, 1989; Goldinger, Luce, Pisoni, & Marcario, 1992;
Hamburger & Slowiaczek, 1996; McQueen & Sereno, 2005; Norris, McQueen, &
Cutler, 2002; Radeau, Morais, & Segui, 1995; Spinelli, Segui, & Radeau, 2001). When
prime and target share two or more initial phonemes, several factors seem to be at
play, namely prelexical facilitation, lexical competition, and strategic processes, and
their effects partly overlie in time (for a recent review, see McQueen & Sereno, 2005;
see also Goldinger, 1999, and Pitt & Shoaf, 2002). As already noted by Chereau et
al. (2007), it is therefore difficult to isolate the role of orthography by using initial
overlap. In addition, in this case at least, part of the orthographic priming effect can
probably be attributed to strategies as well.
In the present paper, we more particularly wanted to examine whether orthography modulates the final overlap priming effect. For sure, the facilitation effect
observed with a final phonological overlap between prime and target (e.g., `chaindrain') is stronger and more reliable than initial overlap effects, both through tasks
and materials. In addition, this effect seems to occur much earlier in the course of
target processing. It is transient, decreasing with long ISI (e.g., 500 ms, Radeau et
al., 1995), only occurs under unimodal (auditory-auditory) presentation (Cutler, van
Ooijen, & Norris, 1999; Dumay, Benraiss, Barriol, Colin, Radeau, & Besson, 2001;
Radeau, Segui, & Morais, 1994; Spinelli et al., 2001), and seems insensitive to both
absolute and relative (prime-target) word frequency (Radeau et al., 1995) as well as to
prime lexicality (e.g., Radeau et al., 1994; Slowiaczek, McQueen, Soltano, & Lynch,
2000). These characteristics suggest that at least part of the final overlap facilitation
effect reflects automatic activation of prelexical representations (e.g., McQueen &
Sereno, 2005; Monsell & Hirsh, 1998; Norris et al., 2002; Slowiaczek et al., 2000).
For this reason, the occurrence of an orthographic effect in final overlap priming
would provide strong evidence for the influence of orthography on early spoken word
recognition processes.
However, even for final overlap priming, one cannot rule out the possibility
that participants develop some strategies during the task, and that these produce or
at least enhance the reported phonological or orthographic priming effects. In some
studies examining orthographic modulation of the final overlap facilitation effect,
such strategies may have been induced by a long ISI (e.g., over 800 ms in Miller &
Swick, 2003) and / or by a large proportion of related trials (e.g., 50%, in Burton et al.,
1996), which increases the salience of the prime-target relationship.
The relationship between prime and target can be used in several ways, especially
in the lexical decision task (see e.g., Holender, 1992; Norris et al., 2002; Radeau, Morais,
& Dewier, 1989; Slowiaczek et al., 2000). In particular, due to the salience of the rhyme
(to which even young children are highly sensitive, e.g., Bradley & Bryant, 1983), if the

target rhymes with the preceding item, their phonological congruency may be more
consistent with a positive ("word") response than with a negative ("nonword") one.
As shown by Norris et al. (2002), listeners are thus biased towards saying "yes" to
targets rhyming with their primes, unless foils almost rhyming with their primes (e.g.,
`film-kilt', or `bulk-sulsh') discourage this strategy. Without such foils, this strategy
leads in lexical decision to an enhanced rhyme priming effect on word targets, but to
a null or inhibitory effect on nonword targets (Norris et al., 2002; see also Monsell
& Hirsh, 1998; Praamstra, Meyer, & Levelt, 1994).
Studying the effect of orthography on final overlap priming, Chereau et al.
(2007) tried to overcome the problem of strategic processing by using materials that
included foils having the same characteristics as those used by Norris et al. (2002).
This was assumed to reduce the use of a congruency checking strategy facilitating
positive responses for related trials and to discourage the listeners from resorting
to an anticipatory strategy: since in foils prime and target do rhyme except for their
final phoneme, anticipations should lead to answer "yes" erroneously to nonword foil
targets (e.g., `bulk-sulsh', since `sulk' is a word) and "no" to word foil targets (`filmkilt', since `kilm' is not a word). In lexical decision, Chereau et al. observed stronger
facilitation when prime and target shared both the phonological and orthographic
rime than when they only shared the phonological one. This orthographic "boost" (the
authors' term) persisted even when participants were forced to respond rapidly and
when a reversed lexical decision task (in which participants had to respond "yes" to
nonwords) was used in order to further reduce the impact of a congruency checking
strategy facilitating positive responses for related trials. Based on these findings,
the authors claimed for mandatory and automatic orthographic activation during
spoken word recognition.
However, as already noted by Norris et al. (2002) and by McQueen and Sereno
(2005), although including foils in the materials could help the listener to minimize
the anticipatory component of phonological priming, it could induce other strategies.
In particular, we hypothesized that by obscuring the phonological relations between
prime and target, the inclusion of foils may lead listeners not only to ignore (or at
least to pay less attention to) the phonological relation between prime and target, but
also, and concurrently, to rely more on other potentially relevant information such
as word spelling. In the present study, we checked for this possibility by comparing
a situation without foils (Experiment 1) to a situation with foils (Experiment 2).
Except for the presence or not of such foils, the materials were the same in the
two experiments. They included trials in which prime and target shared both their
phonology and orthography (henceforth, orthographically matching condition) as well
as trials in which prime and target only shared their phonology (pure phonological
overlap: henceforth, orthographically mismatching condition). Any difference in the
priming effect obtained in the orthographically matching and mismatching condition compared to an unrelated, control, condition would capture the influence of
orthographic knowledge. In addition, any gain of performance in the orthographically
mismatching condition compared to the unrelated condition would capture facilitation
due to phonological overlap.

Phonological and orthographic auditory priming

The same targets were thus paired with the three prime types that corresponded to
three conditions. For example, the target word "faute" ( /fot/, `mistake') was preceded
by "cote" ( /kot/, `rib' or `slope') in the orthographically mismatching condition, by
"saute" ( /sot/, `sudden change') in the orthographically matching condition, and by
"ville" ( /vil/, `town') in the unrelated condition. As illustrated, the final overlap of
monosyllabic pairs always involved the rime. In order to test the generality of the
effect, there were also disyllabic pairs, in which the final overlap always involved the
full second syllable. For example, the target "modele" ( /mdl/ , `model') was preceded
by "chandelle" ( /adl/, `candle') in the orthographically mismatching condition, by
"fidele" ( /fidl/, `faithful, loyal') in the orthographically matching condition, and by
"gitane" ( /itan/, `gipsy') in the unrelated condition.
In order to overcome the methodological limitations presented by some previous
studies, we tried to reduce the possibility for participants to develop response strategies
by using a short ISI (50 ms) and by presenting each participant with each target only
once. This led us to use three different experimental lists, with only 15% of related
trials in each list.
To further check whether the putative orthographic influence on formal priming
reflects an effect arising at a very early processing stage, in both Experiments 1 and 2
the same materials were presented for lexical decision and shadowing; the shadowing
response only requires an accurate analysis of the phonetic properties of the (word
or nonword) stimulus in order to build an articulatory plan, and does not rely on any
binary choice decision. As such, compared to lexical decision, it is regarded as biasing
participants towards the prelexical level, as being exempt of decisional processes
(Balota & Chumbley, 1984; Jakimik et al., 1985; Norris, 1986; Vitevitch & Luce, 1999),
and as far less sensitive to congruency biases (Norris et al., 2002). Comparison of
the influence of orthography in these two tasks is thus also critical to determine the
origin of such an effect.
In line with the objective presented above, we formulated three main predictions.
First, if orthographic knowledge was modulating the priming effect, we should find
stronger priming in the orthographically matching compared to the orthographically
mismatching condition. Second, assuming that, like the orthographic consistency
effect, the putative orthographic priming effect does not arise early in the processing
route (cf. Ventura et al., 2004), we expected orthography to modulate the priming effect
in lexical decision but not in shadowing. Third, even in lexical decision, orthographic
priming would emerge mainly when phonological relations between prime and target
were obscured by the presence of almost rhyming foils.

native French speakers and none of them reported any hearing or speech disorder.
Half of them were required to perform a shadowing task, and the others a lexical
decision task.
2.1.2

Materials
All the items were recorded by a male native French speaker on a Sony minidisc
recorder. They were digitized at a sampling rate of 32kHz with 16-bit analog-todigital conversion, using Sound Tools / DigiDesign editor software on a Macintosh
SI Computer.
The materials consisted of 936 pairs of word prime and word or nonword target.
They corresponded to 216 critical word pairs, 216 critical word-nonword pairs and
504 fillers. For each of these pair types, half of the pairs included two monosyllabic
sequences, while the other half included two disyllabic sequences.
For the critical word pairs, each one of 72 different target words was paired
with three different prime words. These primes corresponded to one of three priming
conditions. In the orthographically mismatching condition, prime and target ended
with the same phonological sequence, but with different spellings. In the orthographically matching condition, prime and target ended with the same phonological and
orthographic sequence. In the unrelated condition, prime, and target ended with
different phonological and orthographic sequences. The final overlap of monosyllabic
pairs always involved the rime, whereas the final overlap of disyllabic pairs always
involved the full second syllable. The syllabic structure of the prime was controlled
across conditions.
For the critical word-nonword pairs, each one of 72 different nonword targets was
paired with three word primes, two of which ending with the same phonology as the
target (related condition), and one sharing no information with the target (unrelated
condition). For example, the monosyllabic nonword "louge" ( /lu/ ) was preceded
by the monosyllabic word prime "rouge" ( /ru/, `red') and "bouge" ( /bu/, `hovel').
Similarly, the disyllabic nonword "goussive" ( /gusiv/ ) was preceded by the disyllabic
word prime "lessive" ( /lesiv/, `washing') and "missive" ( /misiv/, `missive'). The other
pairs were unrelated, as for example "louge" which was preceded by "pate" ( /pat/,
`pastry') and "goussive" which was preceded by "barrage" ( /bara/, `dam'). As shown
by these examples, the overlap was similar as the one used for the word pairs, with
a rime overlap for monosyllables and a full second syllable overlap for disyllables.
All the nonwords were pronounceable and included consistent rimes. The syllabic
structure of the prime was also controlled across conditions.
The complete list of critical word and word-nonword pairs is presented in
Appendix A, and the characteristics (i.e., word frequency, phonological, and orthographic uniqueness point, number of phonological, orthographic, phonographic, and
rime phonographic neighbors, acoustic duration, number of phonemes and graphemes
of the critical part, and number of phonemes and graphemes shared between prime
and target) of the critical word targets and primes are presented in Appendix B,
after suppressing the stimuli that had been discarded from the analyses following
preliminary data inspection (see the Results section).

Phonological and orthographic auditory priming

The 504 pairs of fillers included unrelated prime and target, half of these targets
being words and the other half nonwords.
Three lists of 648 trials (prime-target pairs) were constructed. Each one included
72 critical word pairs, 72 critical word-nonword pairs and all the 504 filler pairs.
Each of the 72 critical word targets and each of the 72 critical nonword targets was
preceded by one of the three possible primes. As regards the critical word pairs, the
same number of target words (12 monosyllabic and 12 disyllabic) was paired with
primes belonging to each of the three priming conditions. For critical word-nonword
pairs, 48 nonword targets (24 monosyllabic and 24 disyllabic) were paired with related
primes and the other 24 (12 monosyllabic and 12 disyllabic nonwords) were unrelated.
Thus, no critical word or nonword target was presented more than once within each
list, and across lists each target was preceded by each of the three primes. Each list
included only 15% of related trials, that is, trials in which prime and target shared
their phonology or their phonology and orthography.
Each of the three lists was split into six monosyllabic blocks and six disyllabic
blocks of 54 trials each. Within each block, there were six critical word pairs (2 for
each priming condition), six critical word-nonword pairs (4 phonologically related
pairs and 2 unrelated) and 42 fillers. The order of within-block stimulus presentation
was pseudorandom, with the constraints that the same response (word or nonword)
never occurred more than three times consecutively, and that the trials belonging to
the same priming condition or the targets ending with the same rime never occurred
successively. Each block always started with five filler trials.
2.1.3

Procedure
For each task, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups of 10
participants, corresponding to the three different lists. Thus, each participant was
presented with only one list and hence heard a given stimulus only once.
The stimuli were presented auditorily at a comfortable level through a pair of
SONY headphones. The participants were tested individually in a quiet room, in one
session that lasted about 75 mins. Those who participated in lexical decision were
instructed to listen carefully to the stimuli of each pair and to indicate, by pushing
one of the two response buttons placed in front of them, as quickly and accurately
as possible if the second stimulus of the pair was a real French word or a nonword.
Response latency was measured from the onset of the target to the button-press
response. Those who participated in shadowing were asked to repeat aloud the second
stimulus of each pair as rapidly and accurately as possible. The vocal response triggered a simple threshold voice key connected to a button box provided by the E-prime
software (Schneider, Eschman, & Zuccolotto, 2002 a; b).1 Naming latencies were

Tyler, Tyler, and Burnham (2005) suggested that the use of a simple threshold voice key does
not provide accurate RTs when the targets of different experimental conditions do not share the
same initial phonemes. This was not a problem in the present study: since the same targets were
used across priming conditions, we were able to avoid both problems related to differences in
articulatory requirements for producing different sounds and difficulties linked to the detection

measured from the onset of the target stimulus to the onset of the participants' vocal
responses. In this latter task, the whole session was recorded on a SONY minidisc,
which enabled us to identify occasional naming errors.
There was a 50 ms interval between the two stimuli of a pair. Presentation was
controlled and response latencies and errors were collected by the E-Prime 1.1 software
(Schneider et al., 2002 a; b).
In order to make participants familiar with the task, the session started with two
practice blocks of 14 monosyllabic trials each. This was followed by the presentation
of six monosyllabic experimental blocks. There was a 2 min break between each block
of trials and a 2 s interval between the response and the beginning of the next trial.
The same procedure was used for disyllabic blocks, which were also preceded by two
practice blocks. Feedback was provided only during the practice blocks.
Orthographic knowledge of the participants was estimated by asking them, at the
end of the experiment, to write down the critical stimuli they had heard in the main
task. This spelling task was divided into two parts. Stimuli were first presented as
prime-target pairs and participants were instructed to write down only the target of
each pair. Order of the pairs was pseudorandom. Then, only the prime stimuli were
presented one at a time and participants were instructed to write down each stimulus.
The aim of this procedure was to check the participants' orthographic knowledge
while keeping the presentation of the stimuli identical to the one applied during the
main task. The fact that participants only had to write down the targets in the first
part of the spelling task should also have prevented them from merely transposing
the spelling pattern of a word prime onto a nonword target.
2.2
Results

Response accuracy and response latency data were analyzed separately, as were data
on critical word and nonword targets. Preliminary inspection of the Reaction Time
data (RTs) led us to discard from further analyses deviant RTs, that is, those longer
or shorter than the mean RT observed on correct trials plus or minus 2.5 SDs. This
was done separately for monosyllabic and disyllabic target words. With this criterion,
2.9% and 1.6% of the RT data of lexical decision and shadowing were eliminated,
respectively.
In addition, we checked whether the critical word targets and primes had been
written as expected in the spelling task. Two word targets (`pipeau' and `beret') and
three word primes (`galet', `glaive', and `dome') led to less than 70% expected spellings.
The same criterion was applied to nonword targets in word-nonword related pairs,
since each critical nonword was expected to be spelled in the same way as its word
prime of the related condition, both items including only consistent rimes. Only one
nonword ( /ln/ ) led to less than 70% expected spellings. We decided to exclude these
three targets (two words and one nonword) and their associated word primes from
further analyses. Similarly, we excluded the complete set of stimuli corresponding
of different sounds with the voice key (see also Kessler, Treiman, & Mullennix, 2002; Rastle &
Davis, 2002).

to the primes `galet', `glaive', and `dome'. Finally, the target `role' and its associated

into account, in the following analyses, 66 complete word sets and 71 complete wordnonword sets. The data on these restricted sets of stimuli are presented in Table 1.

2.2.1

Word-word pairs
For critical word targets, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted by subjects
(F1) and by items (F 2) on the priming effects, which were calculated as the difference
between the results obtained in the unrelated and each of the related conditions.
This was done separately for RTs on correct responses and for accuracy scores, in
shadowing and lexical decision and, within each task, for critical word and nonword
targets. Within each analysis, orthographic overlap (with orthography matching or
mismatching the phonological relation between prime and target in the related condition) and number of syllables (mono- vs. disyllables) were treated as within-subject
factors. In the item analysis, given that the same targets words were used in all priming
conditions, orthographic overlap was treated as a within-item factor, while number
of syllables was treated as a between-item factor.
In shadowing, no significant effect was found either in the RT or in the accuracy
data (all F s  1).
In lexical decision, no significant effect was observed in the RT data (all F s < 1).
Only an unreliable effect of orthographic overlap was found in the accuracy data,
F1(1, 29) = 2.82, p>.1; F2(1, 64) = 5.65, p <.025: priming was stronger in the orthographically matching than in the orthographically mismatching condition. Neither number
of syllables, F 1(1, 29) = 1.04; F 2(1, 64) = 2.73, p >.1 in both cases, nor its interaction
with orthographic overlap, F1(1, 29) = 2.14; F2(1, 64) = 1.75, p >.1 in both cases, reached
significance.
The quasi absence of effect of orthographic overlap contrasts with the strong
and reliable facilitation due to phonological overlap between prime and target. As
a matter of fact, the Student t -tests comparing the RTs obtained in the unrelated
and orthographically mismatching conditions showed an RT advantage of the latter
condition in both lexical decision and shadowing, although the difference was not
reliable in the latter task [lexical decision: t 1(29) = 5.06; t 2(65) = 5.24, p <.0001 in both
cases, shadowing: t 1(29) = 2.65, p <.025; t 2(65) = 1.61, p>.1].2
2.2.2

Word-nonword pairs
Given that the orthographic information was not manipulated for nonword targets,
only the presence of the phonological facilitation effect was examined using ANOVAs
performed separately for each task on the RT (for correct responses) and accuracy
scores. Each analysis included condition (unrelated vs. related) and number of syllables
as within-subject factors. In the item analyses, since the same nonword targets were
used in both the unrelated and related conditions, this factor was treated as a withinitem factor, while number of syllables was a between-item factor.
In shadowing, the RT analyses showed a significant condition effect,
F1 (1, 29) = 16.72; F2 (1, 69) = 16, p <.0001, in both cases, reflecting facilitation due to

All significant results remained so even when the alpha level was adjusted (p <.017) according
to the Bonferroni method.

phonological overlap between prime and target. In addition, monosyllabic targets
led to faster RTs than disyllabic targets, F1 (1, 29) = 30.97; F2 (1, 69) = 14.67, p <.0001,
in both cases, but the interaction between condition and number of syllables was not
significant, F1 (1, 29) = 2.05; F2 (1, 69) = 2.19, p>.1, in both cases. No significant effect
was found in the accuracy data (all Fs  1).
Similar analyses performed on the RT data obtained in lexical decision also
showed facilitation due to phonological overlap, F1(1, 29) = 21.94; F2(1, 69) = 26.48,
p <.0001, in both cases. In this task, disyllabic targets led to faster RTs than monosyllabic targets, F1 (1, 29) = 13.84, p =.001; F 2 (1, 69) = 9.5, p <.005, and the interaction
between condition and number of syllables was significant in the subject analysis and
almost reached significance in the item analysis, F 1 (1, 29) = 4.07, p =.05; F 2 (1, 69) = 3.38,
p =.07. Although the facilitation effect was stronger for disyllables than for monosyllables, it was significant in both cases [monosyllables: F1 (1, 29) = 5.99; F2 (1, 34) = 5.8,
p <.025, in both cases, disyllables: F1 (1, 29) = 25.47; F2 (1, 35) = 23.16, p <.0001, in both
cases]. The analyses performed on the accuracy data only showed an unreliable effect
of number of syllables, F 1 (1, 29) = 4.9, p <.05; F 2 (1, 69) = 1.71, p >.1; neither the effect
of condition nor its interaction with number of syllables was significant (all Fs < 1).
In conclusion, using materials and experimental designs aimed at reducing the
intervention of strategies in a priming situation (final overlap, short ISI, low percentage
of related trials and a single presentation of each target to the same participant), in both
lexical decision and shadowing we failed to observe the orthographic effect previously
reported in the literature (e.g., Baum & Leonard, 1999; Burton et al., 1996; Chereau et
al., 2007; Leonard & Baum, 1997; Miller & Swick, 2003). Given the presence in both
tasks of a phonological facilitation effect for both word and nonword targets, failing
to find an orthographic influence in the present experiment is unlikely to be due to
a response bias or strategy that could somehow have interfered with normal speech
recognition processes and concealed the orthographic effect.
The absence of an orthographic modulation of the final overlap priming effect
observed here contrasts with the significant effect of orthography reported by Chereau
et al. (2007). In the next experiment, we tried to check whether this discrepancy
might be due to the fact that these authors included almost rhyming foils (of the type
proposed by Norris et al., 2002) in their experimental list, which was not the case here:
including such kind of foils obscures the phonological relation between prime and
target, and hence may lead participants to pay less attention to phonology and more
attention to other sources of potentially relevant information, such as orthography.
To check for this possibility, in Experiment 2 about 33% of the fillers were replaced
by pairs in which the target almost rhymed (or shared the second syllable) with its
prime, like `courbe - lourde' (/kurb/-/lurd/) or `litige - fatigue' (/liti/-/fatig/) for wordword pairs, and `cerne - terve' (/srn/-/trv/) or `demence - semenge' (/demas/-/sma/)
for word-nonword pairs. If such foil pairs were actually biasing listeners towards
paying more attention to orthography, we should, in comparison to the unrelated
condition, find stronger facilitation in the orthographically matching condition than
in the orthographically mismatching one.

3 Experiment 2
3.1
Method
3.1.1

Participants
A total of 60 undergraduate students of Universite Libre de Bruxelles (17 men and 43
women, aged 18 to 27 yrs; average: 21 yrs) were paid for their participation. All were
native French speakers and none of them reported any hearing or speech disorder.
Half of them were required to perform a shadowing task, the others were required
to perform a lexical decision task.
3.1.2

Materials
The critical stimuli were the same as those of Experiment 1, but foils replaced 33.3%
of the fillers (i.e., 168 out of 504 pairs). The characteristics of these stimuli were
similar to those reported in Norris et al.'s study (2002). On half of the foil trials, word
targets were preceded by word primes with which they almost rhymed (for example,
`courbe - lourde', (/kurb/ - /lurd/) or almost shared the second syllable (for example,
`litige - fatigue', (/liti/- /fatig/). On the other half of the foil trials, nonword targets
were preceded by word primes with which they almost rhymed (e.g., `cerne - terve',
/srn/-/trv/) or almost shared the second syllable (e.g., `demence - semenge', /demas//sma/).
Construction of the lists and blocks was identical to the one described for
Experiment 1, except for the fact that each list included, in addition to 15% of related
trials, 59% unrelated trials and 26% foils, and that each block included, in addition to
six critical word pairs and six critical word-nonword pairs, 28 fillers and 14 foils.
The order of within-block stimulus presentation was pseudorandom, with the
same constraints as for Experiment 1. Each block also started with five filler trials.
3.1.3

Procedure
The procedure was identical to that of Experiment 1.
3.2
Results

As in Experiment 1, response accuracy and response latency data were analyzed
separately for shadowing and lexical decision and, within each task, for critical
word and nonword targets. Preliminary inspection of the RT data led us to discard
deviant RTs from further analyses, separately for lexical decision and shadowing.
With this criterion, 3.2% and 1% of the RT data of lexical decision and shadowing
were eliminated, respectively. Only the data of the stimuli that were kept for the
analyses in Experiment 1 were taken into account. The results of Experiment 2 are
presented in Table 2.

3.2.1

Word-word pairs
ANOVAs similar to those performed in Experiment 1 on the data of word-word
pairs were used here. For shadowing, no effect emerged in the analyses performed
on the RT data, F1(1, 29) = 3.1, p >.05; F2(1, 64) = 2.10, p >.1, for orthographic overlap,
F 1(1, 29) = 2.73, p>.1; F 2 < 1, for number of syllables, and F 1; F 2 < 1 for their interaction, and only a trend towards an effect was found in the analyses performed on
Language and Speech

the accuracy data, F 1(1, 29) = 3.95, p =.056; F 2(1, 64) = 3.49, p =.066. Unexpectedly, it
reflected a priming effect that was slightly stronger (by 0.89%) in the orthographically
mismatching condition compared to the orthographically matching condition.
In lexical decision, the RT analyses showed a significant effect of orthographic
overlap, F 1(1, 29) = 11.88, p <.005; F 2(1, 64) = 4.97, p <.05, which interacted with
number of syllables, F1(1, 29) = 7.41; F2(1, 64) = 7.2, p  .01, in both cases. The analyses
performed separately on mono- and disyllables showed that the influence of orthography was restricted to disyllables, F1(1, 29) = 21.78, p <.0001; F2(1, 32) = 11.96, p <.005,
for monosyllables: F 1 and F 2 < 1. The accuracy analyzes only revealed a marginal
and unreliable effect of number of syllables, F 1(1, 29) = 3.96, p =.056; F 2(1, 64) = 2.01,
p>.1, but no effect of orthographic overlap or interaction of this factor with number
of syllables (all F s < 1).
So it seems that orthographic knowledge only modulated the lexical decision
RTs and that this effect was limited to the disyllabic stimuli. This observation is
confirmed by a combined analysis (ANOVAs) of the RT data from lexical decision
and shadowing that used the percentage of priming effect in relation to the control
baseline as a dependent variable. As a matter of fact, the ANOVAs (which included
orthographic overlap as a within-subject and within-item factor, number of syllables
as a within-subject and between-item factor, and task as a between-subject and withinitem factor) showed a marginal three-way interaction, F1(1, 58) = 3.56; F2(1, 64) = 3.76,
p =.06, in both cases, and the decomposition of this interaction showed that the
orthographic effect was indeed significant only in lexical decision when disyllabic
stimuli were used, F 1(1, 29) = 21.24, p <.0001; F 2(1, 32) = 11.46, p <.005.
As we had done in the previous experiment, we checked whether participants'
performances benefited from the phonological overlap between prime and target.
The comparison between the RTs obtained in the unrelated and orthographically mismatching conditions showed that this was indeed the case for shadowing,
t 1(29) = 6.12, p <.0001; t 2(65) = 2.80, p <.01. As regards lexical decision, a significant
phonological priming effect emerged for monosyllabic targets, t 1(29) = 3.24, p <.005;
t 2(32) = 4.36, p <.0001, but not for disyllabic ones (t 1 and t 2 < 1).3
3.2.2

Word-nonword pairs
ANOVAs similar to those performed in Experiment 1 on the data of word-nonword
pairs were used here. In shadowing, the RT analyses revealed a significant effect of
condition, F1(1, 29) = 8.57, p <.01; F2(1, 69) = 4.41, p <.05, reflecting an RT advantage
of the related condition over the unrelated one. Although monosyllabic targets led to
faster RTs than disyllabic targets, F 1(1, 29) = 45.54; F 2 (1, 69) = 24.5, p <.0001, in both
cases, this effect did not interact with condition (F1 and F 2 < 1). No significant effect
was found in the accuracy data (all Fs  1).
Facilitation was also observed in lexical decision in the RT data, F1(1, 29) = 15.37,
p <.0001; F 2(1, 69) = 6.21, p <.025. As in Experiment 1, disyllabic targets led to some3

All significant results remained so even when the alpha level was adjusted (p <.017) according
to the Bonferroni method.

what faster RTs than monosyllabic targets, F 1(1, 29) = 11.76, p <.005; F 2 (1, 69) = 5.12,
p <.05, but here this effect did not interact with condition (F 1 and F 2 < 1). The analyses
performed on the accuracy data only showed an unreliable effect of number of
syllables, F1(1, 29) = 6.58, p <.025; F2(1, 69) = 1.98, p >.1, but no effect of condition (F1
and F2 < 1) or interaction between these two variables, F1(1, 29) = 2.21; F2(1, 69) = 1.99,
p>.1, in both cases.
To sum up: contrary to what had been reported in Experiment 1, an influence of
orthographic congruency was observed here. However, this effect was limited to lexical
decision, and, in this task, was observed only when disyllabic stimuli were used.
As regards the phonological priming effect observed on word targets, in lexical
decision the presence of the foils had an effect in the expected direction, reducing the
size of the effect. While on the whole this decrease was less dramatic than the one
reported by Norris et al. (2002), who showed a reduction of the phonological priming
effect from 118 to 27ms, it was present for monosyllabic word targets (with, compared
to Experiment 1, a reduction of the phonological priming effect from 61 to 47 ms) and
was very strong for disyllabic word targets (with, compared to Experiment 1, a reduction from 44 to 4ms, an effect which is no longer significant). The lack of a significant
effect in the latter situation contrasts with the robust phonological facilitation effect
observed in all the other cases, both in the present experiment and in Experiment 1.
So, in the present lexical decision experiment, the presence for disyllables of an
orthographic effect seems to go along with the absence of phonological facilitation:
for disyllabic words the priming effect observed in the orthographically matching
condition did not differ much between Experiments 1 and 2 (53 and 50ms, respectively),
while the one observed in the mismatching condition clearly did, since it shrank
dramatically from Experiment 1 to 2. Hence, the orthographic effect observed here
does not seem to reflect an orthographic boost due to the congruency between the
orthographic and phonological representations of prime and target that characterized
the orthographically matching condition. It rather seems to reflect the interference
due to orthographic incongruence between the phonologically overlapping stimuli
of the orthographically mismatching condition.
This interference effect is probably related to the presence of foil pairs that made
phonological relations between prime and target less systematic than in Experiment 1.
These foils might have biased listeners towards paying less attention to phonology
and to resort more to other potentially relevant information, in the present case to
word spelling.
Note that in lexical decision the orthographic interference effect occurred despite
the fact that the inclusion of foils did not fully eliminate the listeners' tendency to
anticipate the target on the basis of the phonological form of the prime. As already
noted by Norris et al. (2002) and by Chereau et al. (2007), in lexical decision, responses
to foils were delayed and less accurate than responses to other fillers. This was the
case here for both word and nonword targets, whichever their length (see Table 3).
Contrary to what had been observed by Norris et al., a bias to assume that the target
will end in a way similar to the prime seems to have occurred here in shadowing too
(see also Table 3). This difference may be linked to the fact that, in Norris et al.'s
study, the presence of foils led to slower shadowing responses overall, which was
Language and Speech

C. Pattamadilok, R. Kolinsky, P. Ventura, M. Radeau, J. Morais

521

not the case here, since shadowing responses were on the whole as fast in the present
experiment as in Experiment 1. Much more important is the fact that, despite this
bias, in shadowing the presence of foils did not induce any modulation of the priming
effects by orthographic (in)congruency, and hence did not eliminate or even reduce
the facilitation due to phonological overlap.

4 General discussion
The aim of the present work was to examine whether orthographic knowledge influences speech processing automatically at a very early processing level. The influence
of orthographic knowledge was investigated using manipulation of the orthographic
congruency of stimuli presented in an auditory priming situation with final overlap.
A comparison between the priming effect obtained when prime and target shared the
same phonology and orthography and when they only shared the same phonology did
not show any hint of orthographic influence either in lexical decision or in shadowing,
except when foils, the partial overlap trials that aimed at turning the prime-target
phonological relationship less salient, were included in the materials. In the latter
case, the orthographic effect was found only in lexical decision, not in shadowing.
In addition, in lexical decision the orthographic effect was only observed on disyllabic stimuli, and for these its emergence coincided with the absence of facilitation due
to phonological overlap. Since in comparison with the no-foils situation (Experiment 1)
only the latter effect shrank when foils were included in the materials (Experiment 2),
this pattern of results seems to reflect interference by incongruent orthographic
representations rather than facilitation due to orthographic congruency.
At least two factors may explain why this orthographic interference effect was
restricted to disyllables. In particular, the length (and hence the number of syllables)
of the stimuli was confounded with both the type and the size of the overlap, namely

rime overlap in monosyllables and syllable overlap in disyllables. Given that in French
syllables are important not only for spoken word recognition (e.g., Kolinsky, Morais, &
Cluytens, 1995; Mehler, Dommergues, Frauenfelder, & Segui, 1981) but also as written
words processing units (Cole, Magnan, & Grainger, 1999; Doignon & Zagar, 2005),
orthographic incongruence may be more disturbing at this level than at rime level, in
particular when foils encourage listeners to pay attention to orthography. The degree of
orthographic similarity between prime and target of the orthographically mismatching
condition is another factor that might have contributed to the orthographic interference effect: when they only overlapped at phonological level, disyllabic prime and
target were orthographically less similar to each other than monosyllabic pairs were;
their average orthographic similarity was 22.4 and 50.6, respectively, according to
Marmurek and Kwantes' (1994) metric of orthographic similarity.4
In any case, the present data suggest that the influence of orthographic knowledge on spoken word recognition is rather limited. This will be discussed further
below, as a function of different related theoretical issues.
Over the last few years, it has consistently been shown that orthographic information has an impact on spoken word recognition. Far from being confined to
metaphonological judgments, orthographic effects have been reported in on-line
tasks as well. In particular, robust consistency effects have been reported in lexical
decision and lexically-contingent shadowing (e.g., Ventura et al., 2004; Ziegler &
Ferrand, 1998), and a modulation of priming effects by orthographic knowledge
has been observed in both lexical decision and shadowing (e.g., Chereau et al., 2007;
Slowiaczek et al., 2003).
Listeners do not seem to use word spelling in a strategic way to enhance their
performances in these on-line tasks. For example, orthographic inconsistency is very
frequent in the French orthographic system, but nevertheless hinders spoken word
recognition in French natives, as shown by the word consistency effect (Ziegler &
Ferrand, 1998; Ziegler, Ferrand, & Montant, 2004). In the same way, the orthographic
effect observed in the lexical decision situation used in Experiment 2 of the present
study reflected interference by incongruent orthographic representations without any
facilitation due to orthographic congruency. Thus, word spelling may affect auditory
priming even when this information is potentially harmful for performance.
The influence of orthographic knowledge on word recognition cannot be reduced
to congruency effects either, as shown by the very occurrence of the orthographic
consistency effect (Ventura et al., 2004; Ziegler & Ferrand, 1998; Ziegler et al., 2004).
However, as justified below, this does not imply that the observed effects arise early in
the processing system or that they are automatic, in the sense that they would act whenever listeners hear their native language, independently of the task or listening context.
In a former series of experiments, we argued that the word consistency effect first
reported by Ziegler and Ferrand (1998) was in fact restricted to situations involving
lexical activation and some lexically-related decision, as a robust consistency effect
4

This measure varies from 0 to 100, where a 100 score corresponds to perfect similarity. Only the
critical part of the stimuli (i.e., the rime of monosyllables and the second syllable of disyllables)
was taken into account in the computation of the degree of orthographic similarity.

had been observed in lexical decision and lexically-contingent shadowing, but not in
the standard shadowing task or when the shadowing response was made dependent
upon a formal criterion (Ventura et al., 2004).
However, other authors argued for early and / or automatic activation of orthographic representations by showing that the orthographic (in)congruency between
prime and target modulates formal priming effects not only in lexical decision
(Chereau et al., 2007; Slowiaczek et al., 2003), but also in shadowing (Slowiaczek et
al., 2003), a task known to be much less affected by strategies and response biases
(Norris et al., 2002). Yet, in the latter case the authors used initial overlap priming,
an effect that may be influenced by several factors, namely prelexical facilitation,
lexical competition, and strategic processes (e.g., Goldinger, 1996, 1999; McQueen &
Sereno, 2005; Pitt & Shoaf, 2002). Final overlap priming is likely to be a more adequate
situation to isolate the effect of orthographic knowledge, since it seems mainly due to
the activation of prelexical representations (e.g., McQueen & Sereno, 2005; Monsell
& Hirsh, 1998; Norris et al., 2002; Slowiaczek et al., 2000). Nonetheless, even final
overlap priming effects may be contaminated by the listeners' strategies or response
biases, in particular when decisions need to be made about the spoken targets. It is
thus important to dissociate the findings reflecting normal speech processing from
those resulting from a response bias or a strategic component, as shown by recent
studies on phonological priming (McQueen & Sereno, 2005; Norris et al., 2002).
In the present work, we tried to dissociate automatic from nonautomatic processes
in three ways. First, for all experiments we tried to reduce the intervention of response
strategies by using a short ISI (50ms) and by presenting each participant with each
target only once, a procedure that led to a very low rate of related trials. Second, we
directly contrasted lexical decision to shadowing, a situation that does not involve a
decisional component and which is known to be far less affected by response biases and
strategies (Balota & Chumbley, 1984; Jakimik et al., 1985; Norris, 1986; Norris et al.,
2002; Vitevitch & Luce, 1999). Third, we manipulated the presence of almost rhyming
foils, reasoning that, if orthographic effects were not automatic, they would emerge only
when decisions need to be made about the target, and mainly when blurred prime-target
phonological relations would lead participants to pay less attention to phonology and
more attention to word spelling. Using the same kind of foils, Chereau et al. (2007) did
observe stronger facilitation when prime and target shared both the phonological and
orthographic rime than when they only shared the phonological one.
In accordance with Chereau et al.'s (2007) observations, in the present study an
orthographic effect occurred in lexical decision when the experimental list included
almost rhyming foils. However, these authors did not use the no-foils situation or the
shadowing task. Importantly, in the present study no hint of an orthographic effect
was observed in shadowing or in lexical decision when no foils were presented.
The shadowing performance pattern shows that the influence of orthographic
knowledge in auditory processing does not reflect prelexical connections between
the orthographic and phonological systems. This is in agreement with the data on the
orthographic consistency effect (Ventura et al., 2004) and runs against the prediction
of highly interactive models of spoken word recognition. For example, the interactive activation account (e.g., Ferrand & Grainger, 1996; Grainger & Ferrand, 1994;
Language and Speech

524

Phonological and orthographic auditory priming

Ziegler & Ferrand, 1998) maintains that the interaction between the phonological and
orthographic representations can take place at any stage of speech processing and
so gives rise to orthographic effects in any speech processing situation. The results
reported here are more coherent with our proposition that orthographic knowledge
would affect speech processing only when lexical representations are activated, and / or
postlexically (Ventura et al., 2004; see also Kolinsky, 1998).
Still, neither Ventura et al.'s (2004) results on the orthographic consistency effect
nor the present shadowing data can exclude the possibility that lexical access automatically activates orthographic information (see Chereau et al., 2007, for various possible
mechanisms). For example, although the orthographic consistency effect does not
occur without lexical activation (Ventura et al., 2004), under an interactive account,
once activated, lexical representations might feedback to earlier representational
levels. But the present lexical decision data strongly suggest that the modulation
of formal priming by orthographic knowledge would take place at a rather late
processing level, since the listeners' response times were affected by the prime-target
incongruent spellings in only one specific listening context. It rather seems that it was
the very introduction of foils that, by de-emphasizing the prime-target phonological
relationship, induced the listeners to pay more attention to orthography, even if using
this information was actually detrimental to their performance.
Taken together, the present shadowing and lexical decision data therefore suggest
that orthographic information is not activated early in the speech processing system,
and that accessing the lexicon does not automatically activate orthographic representations. This supports the view that phonological and orthographic representations
may merely coexist and would be matched against each other at a rather late stage
of processing, for example at a decisional stage, much in the same way as lexical
and prelexical representations are integrated at a late stage in the Merge model of
phonemic decision-making (Norris, McQueen, & Cutler, 2000).
Investigating the influence of orthographic knowledge on speech processing
leads us to the existing debate about whether the speech processing system is pervious
to other information that is not originally present in the speech signal. The absence
of any orthographic effect in most of the formal priming situations reported in the
present study suggests that orthographic knowledge does not exert an early and
obligatory influence on speech processing. Contrary to the view that speech processing
is an entirely modular system, encapsulated from the written language system (e.g.,
Coltheart, 1999), we propose that it is modular at low levels (viz., prelexical) of
processing, but interactive at higher levels (possibly lexical and certainly postlexical;
Kolinsky, 1998; Morais & Kolinsky, 1994; Morais et al., 1996; 1997). Nevertheless,
it cannot be ignored that orthographic knowledge influences word recognition in
other situations than in formal priming, as shown by the orthographic consistency
effect (e.g., Ventura et al., 2004; Ziegler & Ferrand, 1998; Ziegler et al., 2003; Ziegler
et al., 2004). While the orthographic priming effect, as observed here, appears to be
postlexical, subject to context or response biases, the orthographic consistency effect
could still be automatic. Verifying this is a challenge for future research.
