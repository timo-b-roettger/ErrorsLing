Abstract Tonal languages differ in how they use phonetic correlates e.g. average pitch
height and pitch direction, for tonal contrasts. Thus, native speakers of a tonal language
may need to adjust their attention to familiar or unfamiliar phonetic cues when perceiving
non-native tones. On the other hand, speakers of a non-tonal language may need to develop
sensitivity to tonal correlates absent from their native system. The current study examines
and compares five language groups' perception of two synthesized Mandarin tones: the high
level tone and the high falling tone. It aims to examine how listeners from tonal and nontonal backgrounds identify and categorize acoustically equidistant pitches varying along two
phonetic dimensions: pitch onset and slope. Results reveal "universal" perceptual patterns
across groups and also tendencies caused by native tonal systems. Our findings confirm that
L1 tonal and prosodic systems affect speakers' sensitivity to novel perceptual cues and their
abilities to discern relevant phonetic differences.

Introduction
Native linguistic experience (L1) shapes our perception of sounds in other languages (L2)
(Best 1995; Flege 1995; Iverson and Kuhl 1995). Extensive research effort has been devoted
to studying how L1 affects learning of consonants and vowels in an L2 (for example: Bohn
and Flege 1990; Best et al. 2001; Aoyama et al. 2004; Best and Tyler 2007; Iverson and Evans
2007; Bohn and Best 2012). Recent research also sees a growing interest in L1 perception
and L2 learning of suprasegmentals such as lexical tones (for example: Wang et al. 2003;

Halle et al. 2004; Wayland and Guion 2004; Khouw and Ciocca 2007; Guion and Pederson
2007; Wayland and Li 2008; So and Best 2010; Peng et al. 2010; Sun and Huang 2012).
Various models have been proposed from phonological and phonetic perspectives to
account for L1's effects on L2 speech perception, e.g., the Perceptual Assimilation Model
(Best 1995), the Native Language Magnet Model (Iverson and Kuhl 1995), the Attend to
Dimension Model (Francis and Nusbaum 2002; Francis et al. 2008; Goldstone 1994, 1998),
and the Automatic Selective Perception Model (Strange 2011). A brief review regarding their
implications for cross-language tone perception is relevant here.
First, focusing on phonological aspects, the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) proposes that L2 sounds are assimilated into the L1 system based on a comparison of L2 phones
with L1 sounds. Learning tones in an L2 by adult tonal language speakers would require a
comparison of two inventories of tones, but PAM's predictions may suffer from a lack of
comparison of phonetic granularities of L1 and L2 tones. For adult speakers of non-tonal
languages, learning tones in an L2 would involve additional difficulty as their L1s uses
a different, though arguably comparable, mechanism for phonological processing of pitch
variations. PAM is faced with a bigger problem in its explanation of tone acquisition by
non-tonal language speakers, due to the lack of corresponding systems in the two languages
to compare. As suggested in Bohn and Best (2012), these problems can be addressed by
looking into the detailed phonetic parameters across languages.
Second, the Native Language Magnet model (NLM) proposes that L1 phoneme categories
are formed in early ages based on good exemplars, and will act as "magnets" to attract any
similar L2 phonemes. In this sense, the presence of a tonal system in L1 greatly affects how
an L2 tone will be grouped according to the L1 tonal categories. But NLM does not address
what directs L2 tones in the magnetizing process if an L1 does not contain tonal categories.
Problems may arise as tones contrast with each other in more than one dimension. Tonal
correlates such as pitch onset, pitch direction, or voice quality, may function as primary or
secondary cues in different tonal languages.
Thirdly, the Attention-to-Dimension Model (A2D) proposes that L2 perceptual learning
changes learners' auditory space represented in terms of a spatial multidimensional model
where distances along phonetic dimensions indicate perceptual features of categorization.
L2 learners thus achieve perceptual learning by redirecting attention or assigning different
weightings to perceptual cues, which results in the restructuring of the auditory space along
relevant dimensions. A2D examines selective attention at multiple phonetic dimensions, and
may account for the learning of L2 tones by tonal language speakers who need to learn to
re-direct their attention to fine phonetic details that may be crucial in their L1 and L2 but to
various extents. Non-tonal language speakers, however, have no similar native phonological
categories that can provide phonetic dimensions along which attention could be readjusted.
Last, the Automatic Selective Perception model (ASP) proposes that native speakers have
established the Selective Perception Routines (SPRs) to automatically detect the most reliable
cues in speech perception. Highly over-learned L1 SPRs may cause problems in L2 speech
processing when learners use their native SPRs to seek the wrong or less reliable information
in L2 input. L2 learning in this sense would require re-attuning learner's attention to the
acoustic-phonetic information that is most crucial in L2 contrasts. Therefore, ASP would
predict that L2 tone perception is influenced by existence and function of the established L1
SPRs that are used for distinguishing native tones. However, similar to the previous models,
ASP does not account for how the lack of SPRs for tone contrasts by non-tonal language
speakers would affect their perception of tones.
Overall speaking, these major models have taken an acoustic-phonetic, a phonological, or
a cognitive ground in explaining and predicting cross-language speech acquisition. However,

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:107-124

109

as reviewed, L2 tone acquisition poses challenges to them all as direct comparison or feature
weighting may not be very applicable. What's more, recent studies, especially those under
the frameworks of PAM and A2D, show more advancement in considering the interactive
functioning of phonetic and phonological factors for a more comprehensive understanding
of the learning process. For example, So and Best (2010) studied discrimination of Mandarin
tone pairs by naive listeners of Mandarin whose L1s were Hong Kong Cantonese, Japanese,
and Canadian English. Pairs of high-level versus low-rising, high-level versus high-falling,
and low-rising versus low-falling-rising tones were found to be difficult for all groups but to
various extents. The general perceptual difficulty was attributed to phonetic characteristics of
tones in each pair, whereas the various degrees of difficulty were attributed to the influence of
L1 phonological systems. What was left unaccounted for in the study is what phonetic cues are
crucial and how they function for different L1 groups. Francis et al. (2008) examined perceptual learning of Cantonese tones by Mandarin and English speakers after a training comprising
naturalistic stimuli. It was noted that Mandarin speakers assimilated Cantonese tones to their
L1 tone categories whereas English speakers to falling/rising intonation of English. Improvement in tone identification by both groups was interpreted as they had learned to reassign
weighting and redirect attention to pitch dimensions relevant to Cantonese tonal contrasts.
In sum, the mechanism underlying tone perception in L1 and L2 has been capturing extensive research effort. It is generally agreed that cross-language tone perception is influenced
by whether certain tonal types present themselves in one's L1. If both L1 and L2 are tonal,
then perceptual accuracy depends on how phonetic correlates of tones vary, probably along
a single dimension or multiple ones in each system. However, such questions still remain
unanswered as how tonal language speakers assign weights to cues along phonetic dimensions in their L1s, and how attention to the cues influences their ability to discern phonetic
differences in L2 perceptual dimensions. Acknowledging the crucial roles of perceptual cues
at both phonetic and phonological levels, we are interested in how they function interactively
in L1 and influence L2 tone perception.

Focus of the Study
As reviewed in previous sections, a satisfactory and comprehensive account of L2 tone
perception must take into consideration not only phonetic and phonological information but
also speakers' attention to fine details of such information in various dimensions. Studies
on perception of tonal contrasts are hence needed to further address how listeners rely on
perceptual cues in various dimensions to distinguish novel tones. As a first step following this
line of research, we investigate how perceptual cues are processed in judging pitch contours
by speakers from various language backgrounds. We focus on Mandarin tonal features in
two dimensions, i.e. pitch height and pitch slope. More specifically, we aim to investigate
and compare non-native listeners' ability to attend to novel cues and to phonetic differences
along novel dimensions in perceiving Mandarin tones.
Mandarin tones are distinctive in tonal features such as pitch onset and shape. They
are, however, found to be perceptually indistinguishable by not only speakers of non-tonal
languages but also by those whose L1s are tonal. For example, the high-level (T1) and highfalling (T4) tones have been reported to cause difficult for Cantonese, Japanese, and English
speakers (Li and Zhang 2010; So and Best 2010; Xi et al. 2010; Hao 2012). Similarly,
Northern Vietnamese speakers found the same pair most difficult in both perception (Wu
and Hu 2004) and production (Yang and Dushi 2008). Well documented yet not thoroughly
examined, the confusion caused by these two acoustically distinctive tones merits research
efforts in an investigation into the perceptual processes involved. Therefore, the contrast of

T1 and T4 in Mandarin is chosen as the focus of our research. A perception experiment is
designed to employ manipulation of two phonetic dimensions of Mandarin tones, so as to
examine how listeners from different tonal and non-tonal backgrounds identify and judge a
continuum of equidistant phonetic changes along the two dimensions.

Study Design
Our study compares perceptual patterns of Mandarin T1 and T4 contrasts by listeners who
are non-native speakers of Mandarin, in order to find out what perceptual correlates they
mainly rely on. Interactions and effects of equidistant changes along two pitch dimensions,
F0 onset and slope, are assessed in tone identification and goodness-fit.

Participants
One hundred university students from a variety of language backgrounds took part in the
experiment. Their L1s included tonal languages such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, and
Vietnamese, and also non-tonal languages such as English, German, Spanish and Hindi.
None of our participants reported having hearing problems. They all filled out a language
background questionnaire before testing. Their prior experience in Mandarin is summarized
in Table 1.
As shown in the table, our Cantonese listeners learned Mandarin for an average of 9 years,
which was the longest among the non-Mandarin groups. Thai and Northern Vietnamese
listeners all took Mandarin courses for about 8 months in China, so did the Indo-European
speakers who took intensive Mandarin courses for 4 months in Hong Kong. A brief interview
on learners' Mandarin experience and background was carried out at recruitment. Learners'
self-reports revealed that Cantonese listeners' formal training in spoken Mandarin at school
did not differ significantly from that of other groups. All Cantonese listeners lived in Hong
Kong all their life, where Cantonese is the major spoken language in daily use. Although
they had taken Mandarin courses for one or two hours each week in primary schools, they
had few opportunities to speak Mandarin off campus. Therefore, the experience in spoken
Mandarin of the four groups did not differ significantly considering the amount of formal
training and off-campus practice.
However, it is reasonable to doubt whether the longer exposure, even only incidental,
would lend benefit to Cantonese speakers. One would expect that the more-than-9-year formal

111

experience by the Cantonese participants would enable them to achieve a more native-like
performance when perceiving the synthesized Mandarin tones than the groups with much less
experience in Mandarin. Such difference if found should be interpreted as a result of combined
effects of L1 and language proficiency. Meanwhile, we recruited 29 native Mandarin speakers
as the control group. Testing five groups of listeners with various L1s and experiences in
Mandarin, our research expects to find out and compare perceptual patterns by and across
listener groups as a function of phonetic dimensions and L1s.

Stimuli
Our stimuli include two Mandarin tonal prototypes and 36 pitches synthesized from the
prototypes. The two prototypes are carried in two meaningful monosyllabic Mandarin words
b
"eight" (T1) and b
"a bully" (T4), and were recorded from a male native speaker of
Mandarin who was in his late 20s at the time of recording. The base syllable /ba/ was selected
for the following reasons: its combinations with all four tones are meaningful and common
Mandarin characters, and the characters out of the combinations are all of high frequency. Our
choice ensures naturalness of recording and minimum bias from word meaning in perception.
Each syllable was repeated 9 times. One clear utterance of T1 and one clear utterance of
T4 were chosen as the exemplars of the prototypes and the bases for stimuli preparation. The
average pitch value of our talker's T1 was 115 Hz, and the pitch range of his T4 was from
135 to 75 Hz. The bases were modified in 2 steps: duration modification and pitch synthesis
using Praat (Boersma and Weenink 2011). First, the duration of the two chosen syllables was
adjusted to 500 ms, and the duration-adjusted syllables were used as the prototypical T1 and
T4. Secondly, the pitch value of the prototypical T1 was modified along two dimensions, pitch
height (F0) and pitch slope (F0), at three points, i.e., onset (0 ms), 100 ms from onset, and
offset (500 ms). F0 refers to the average pitch of the first 100 ms from onset. F0 stands for
pitch difference between 101 ms and 500 ms. Thirdly, a 500-Hz low-pass filter was applied
to minimize influences of segmental information from the two prototypical syllables as well
as all the synthesized pitches. In this way, the stimuli were no longer words but more like
humming sounds to the ear.
Thirty six stimuli were then synthesized in 6 steps, 6 Hz apart from each step, along the
dimensions of pitch height (F0) and pitch slope (F0). Figure 1 below presents an illustration
of pitch manipulation and the outcomes. For example, as illustrated in the leftmost panel in
Fig. 1, the onset of F0 is set at 130 Hz and maintained for 100 ms. The onset-offset F0
difference is set to start from 0 to 30 Hz. With a 6-Hz step, 6 values of F0 is yielded: 0, 6,
12, 18, 24, and 30 Hz. In this way, 6 synthesized pitches with the same F0 onset but different
slopes (F0) are generated. They include a perfect level pitch at 130 Hz, and five contour
pitches with varying falling slopes (130-124, 130-118, 130-112, 130-106, and 130-100
Hz).
If the equal-distance manipulation in Hz is converted to semitone or log measurement,
differences between adjacent levels of pitches at lower frequency range are greater than those
at higher range, hence should be more detectable in perception. In other words, this validates
that the linearity of stimuli should not affect the perceptual non-linearity.

Procedure
Stimuli were presented in an ABX paradigm with A and B as two references (prototypical
T1 and T4) and X as the target. The X sound was chosen randomly from the 36 synthesized
stimuli.

Participants listened through headphones to stimuli played by computers in a speech lab
or a quiet classroom. They could adjust the sound volume to a clear and comfortable level.
In each trial, they heard a trio of sounds with 500-ms inter-stimulus-intervals. They were
instructed to identify whether X is similar to A or B, by clicking the corresponding button,
as shown in Fig. 2. They then were asked to click the button with the corresponding digit
to rate the degree of similarity between X and the A/B they just selected. The rating was on
a 5-point scale with 1 being "very similar" and 5 being "not very similar". The scale was
placed below the buttons of A and B on the computer screen.
The experiment was self-paced, and participants were allowed to listen to each trial as
many times as they wanted to. Once they made a decision, however, they could not replay
again. They were required to make a goodness-of-fit judgment before proceeding to the next
trial. After 10 practice trials at the beginning of the test, each participant completed two
complete test sessions. Each session contained 36 trials. All 36 synthesized stimuli were
presented once in one session, and the sequence was randomized. The T1/T4 presentation
order was consistent within one session, but reversed in the other session. The sequence of
the T1/T4 or T4/T1 order was counterbalanced across participants.

Prediction of Perceptual Outcomes
The tonal languages involved in the study are Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, and Northern
Vietnamese. Mandarin contains 4 phonemic tones: T1 (high level), T2 (high rising), T3
(low falling-rising), and T4 (high falling), of which T1 and T4 are the focus of the study.
Figure 3a shows the pitch contours of Mandarin tones (redrawn by referring to Lee et al.
2008). Cantonese contains 6 phonemic tones: high level, mid level, low level, high rising,

low rising, and extra low (Yip 2002). Pitch contours of the six Cantonese tones are shown
in Fig. 3b (redrawn by referring to Ma et al. 2006). Thai has 5 phonemic tones: high (high
rising), mid (mid falling), low (low falling), rising (low falling-rising), and falling (high
falling). Pitch contours Thai tones are shown in Fig. 3c (redrawn by referring to Wayland
1997; Yip 2002). Northern Vietnamese has 6 phonemic tones that differ in pitch contour
 tone), low falling (huyen tone),
and voice quality: high level (ngang tone), high rising (sac
glottalized low falling (na.ng tone), glottalized falling rising (nga tone), and laryngealized
falling rising (hoi tone). Tones in syllables with voiceless onset have higher pitch values
compared to tones with a voiced onset (Brunelle 2009). Pitch contours of Vietnamese tones
are shown in Fig. 3d (redrawn by referring to Brunelle 2009). The two short tones marked
 and na.ng tones with stops at syllable-final positions.

The non-tonal languages involved are Indo-European language. They are English, French,
Spanish, Russian, and Hindi, which all use pitch variations only at the sentential level for
contrasting at least the falling and rising intonation contours.
As reviewed in earlier sections, both phonetic and phonological features of a tonal and
prosodic system, as well as listeners' attention to fine details in various dimensions, must be
considered in order to account for L2 tone perception more satisfactorily. Predictions for perceptual outcomes are thus proposed as follows. First, tonal speakers should be different from
non-tonal speakers in their perceptual patterns of the synthesized pitches varied along the
two dimensions. The former groups should show a more confident classification of synthesized tones (indexed by a stronger preference in tone identification) and possibly categorical
perception of tonal stimuli. The non-tonal speakers, on the other hand, are expected to be less
certain in classifying stimuli containing modifications along the two phonetic dimensions.
Second, tonal speakers' results should show a clear perceptual boundary between T1/T4 categories, and the boundary may shift across L1 groups due to their distinctive ways in using the
relevant pitch dimensions to contrast their L1 tones. Furthermore, similar perceptual patterns

123

114

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:107-124

are expected if a tonal speaker's L1 shares similar tonal features as contained in Mandarin
T1 and T4.
But since the Mandarin T1 and T4 differ in at least two acoustic dimensions--average
pitch and pitch slope, it is possible that speakers of different tonal L1s vary in whether and
how closely they pay attention to relevant cues. It is predicted that Mandarin speakers should
find it easy to identify those that phonetically resemble their native T1 or T4. The more similar
a stimulus is to the prototype, the higher the identification percentage should be. Moreover,
Mandarin speakers should be more sensitive to changes in the dimension of pitch slope than
to those of pitch height, because the former is reported as the primary cue to tonal contrasts
in Mandarin (Li and Shuai 2011).
For Thai speakers, they should find it easier to identify pitches that are phonetically similar
as their native level and falling tones. However, as noted above since the two level tones in
Thai are slightly falling (Gandour et al. 1988; Gandour and Ponglorpisit 1990), the stimuli
with mild falling slopes may be assimilated as their level tones. Thai speakers should also be
sensitive to changes in the pitch height dimension, as there are three level tones at high, mid
and low-levels in Thai.
For Cantonese speakers, as their L1 does not use high-falling contours for tonal contrast as
our Mandarin prototypes, they may get confused by our stimuli. Similar to the Thai speakers,
Cantonese speakers should be more sensitive to changes in the pitch height dimension as
Cantonese contain 3 phonemic level tones. Moreover, the high level tone is said to have a
high falling variant (So 1996), which may complicate the identification of pitch contours.
Cantonese speakers may be able to detect the subtle allophonic difference, but it may also be
possible that they tend to ignore such difference in tone categorization.
For Northern Vietnamese speakers, because their L1 has one high level tone, they should
find most level pitches similar to this native tone. But since there are no typical high falling
tones in Northern Vietnamese, it may be difficult for these speakers to detect the falling
contour. Additionally, because multiple tone pairs in Vietnamese are mainly differentiated
by pitch height, Vietnamese speakers should be very sensitive to the pitch height dimension
as well.
For our Indo-European language speakers, because their L1s do not use pitch variations
to contrast lexical meanings but to signal intonation classes, they would find the distinction
between level and falling pitches comparable as that between rising and falling intonation
(such as that between a yes-no question and a general declarative in English). In this sense,
it is reasonable to assume that they should find it easier to distinguish between level pitches
and contour ones. However, as such distinction in their L1s is not phonemic, they may be
more likely to ignore pitch variations within the rising/falling intonation classes. Therefore, they should find it difficult to distinguish between falling pitch contours. Moreover,
as noted in previous studies, Indo-European speakers seem sensitive to changes in the pitch
height dimension. Therefore, they would perform better with the distinction between level
pitches.

Results
Percentages of T1 responses in T1/T4 classification and similarity ratings in each tone categories were tallied for each of the 36 stimulus. Mean values were then calculated for each
listener group for further analysis with L1 as the between-subject factor, and F0 onset and
F0 as the within-subject factors. Post-hoc analysis using the Bonferroni correction was
carried out in each L1 group for detailed effects of F0 onset and F0.

Tone Classification
Main effect of L1 is found on the percentage of T1 responses (F(4, 95) = 5.51, p <
.001, 2p = .188). Main effects are also found for both F0(F(2.42, 229.93) = 17.10, p <
.001, 2p = .153) and F0 (F(2.37, 225.29) = 95.42, p < .001, 2p = .498). To compare
the difference between language groups, a post-hoc comparison of the T1 response is conducted which reveals a significant difference between Indo-European and Mandarin speakers
( p < .01), and between Indo-European and Thai language speakers ( p < .01). There is also
significant difference between Cantonese and Thai speakers ( p < .05). Secondly, L1 is also
found to interact significantly with other factors. There are significant interactions between
L1 and F0 (F(9.68, 229.93) = 2.35, p < .05, 2p = .090), and between L1 and F0
(F(9.48, 225.29) = 2.57, p < .01, 2p = .098) in T1/T4 classification. A significant interaction between F0 and F0 (F(18.54, 1761.22) = 3.43, p < .001, 2p = .035) is found as well.

Similarity Scaling
Scores in similarity scaling were first grouped in two categories based on the results of tone
classification and then analyzed separately by category. For T1, a three-way ANOVA with
L1, F0 onset, and F0 as between-subject factors finds a main effect of L1 on the similarity
scaling of tokens judged as belonging to the T1 category (F(4, 15.8) = 3.28, p < .05).
The post hoc analysis reveals significant difference between Cantonese and Thai speakers
( p < .01), and also between Cantonese and Mandarin speakers ( p < .05). F0 onset and
F0 also influenced the similarity scaling significantly (F0 onset : F(5, 385.8) = 64.1, p <
.001, F0 : F(5, 146) = 24.3, p < .001). There were significant interactions between L1
and F0 onset (F(20, 39.3) = 1.66, p < .05), between L1 and F0 (F(20, 41.4) = 1.72, p <
.01), and also between F0 and F0 (F(25, 67.6) = 2.25, p < .001).
For T4, a three-way ANOVA with L1, F0 onset, and F0 as between-subject factors finds
main effects of all three on the similarity scaling of tokens judged as belonging to T4: L1,
F(4, 25.6) = 4.78, p < .001; F0 onset, F(5, 59.4) = 8.89, p < .001; and F0, F(5, 40.1) =
5.9, p < .001. Post-hoc analysis reveals significant differences between Cantonese and
Mandarin speakers ( p < .05), and between Cantonese and Vietnamese speakers ( p < .05).
No significant interactions were found between the three factors ( p > .05 for all).
For a detailed comparison of the effects of the two dimensions across L1s, 2-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA in each L1 groups is carried out with F0 and F0 as between-subject
factors. Table 2(a-c) summarizes the statistical results in tone classification, and similarity
scaling for both T1 and T4. Figure 4 is a schematic representation of T1/T4 identification
and similarity scaling as a function of F0 and F0.
As listed in Table 2, the effect of pitch slope (F0) is significant independent of L1 backgrounds, while the effect of pitch onset (F0) varies across L1 groups. Of all groups, Mandarin
speakers ranked the highest in their responses to variations of F0 in tone identification and
goodness-fit. Their performance also suggests a significant interaction between F0 and F0
in T4 goodness-fit.
As discussed earlier, the two pitch dimensions examined are used in different ways to
contrast tones in Cantonese, Thai, and Vietnamese. Native speakers of these tonal languages
should be more sensitive than non-tonal language speakers to changes along the two pitch
dimensions, but to different extents. Of the five groups, Cantonese speakers came as the
second in the degree of sensitivity to F0 in tone identification, to F0 in T1 goodness-fit, and
to F0 in T4 goodness-fit. Their performance suggests the strongest influence by F0 onset
in T4 goodness-fit.

Thai speakers' tone identification was the least influenced by either F0 onset or F0 in
all groups. In T1 similarity scaling, they appeared more sensitive to F0 than to F0 onset,
the former of which ranked the second and the latter the third of all groups. They seemed
less sensitive to F0 and not at all to F0 onset in T4 similarity scaling.
Northern Vietnamese speakers showed the greatest sensitivity to F0 onset but much less
so to F0 in tone identification. In similarity scaling of both T1 and T4, the influence from
F0 and F0 was intermediate on the performance of Vietnamese speakers, and ranked at the
last and the third respectively among the five groups.
Indo-European speakers appeared sensitive to both F0 and F0 at an intermediate level
compared with other groups. They were, however, the most sensitive group to F0 onset in
T1 similarity scaling but much less so to F0. Their sensitivity to F0 onset and F0 in T4
similarity scaling, however, was ranked the third and the last of all groups.
Summing up the statistical analysis of the three variables: L1, F0, and F0, the following general results are found: main effects of all three on both tone identification and
goodness-fit. Significant interaction between the three variables is also noted. Comparison
across L1 groups confirms the main effect of F0 on tone perception irrespective of L1. The
main effect of F0 onset and the interaction between F0 and F0, however, vary significantly
across language groups.

Discussion
First of all, results further confirm that our stimuli manipulated on a linear scale did not interfere with the nonlinear nature of our perceptual space. As mentioned in stimulus preparation,

Unfilled circles stand for T1, filled ones for T4; and upside-down triangles stand for uncertainty. The size of
circles indicates the degree of preference to one of the two tone categories

if our equidistant (in Hz) stimuli are converted to semitone or log measurement, distances
between adjacent steps in lower frequency ranges become greater than those in higher ranges.
Then differences between adjacent levels in higher ranges should be more conspicuous and
perceptually detectable. However, many of our participants could distinguish between adjacent pitch heights above 112 Hz, but seemed unable to detect the difference between 100
and 106 Hz. This confirms that the linearity in our stimulus matrix did not affect the actual
perception.
Secondly, the main effect of L1 on tone identification and goodness-fit suggests that the
tendency to identify a pitch as belonging to the level or falling tone category is significantly

123

118

different across listener groups. Listeners' L1s affect the overall tone perception, and also
determine the relative weighting assigned to different phonetic dimensions. L1's influence
on cue (re)weighting finds evidence in the various interactions between L1 and F0, and also
between L1 and F0. These joint-effects indicate that listeners of different L1s give different
weights to F0 and F0 when they distinguish between level and falling pitch contours.
There are cross-language effects of F0 and F0 in addition to the influence of L1's
phonological system. Influences of the native prosodic system are reflected in L1's main
effect, the interaction between L1 and F0, and the interaction between L1 and F0. F0
is not the only primary cue in distinguishing level and falling pitch contours, but F0 also
interferes with the judgment of the pitch contour.
In the detailed analysis of F0 and F0 within each language group, the percentage of
T1 response was interpreted as an index of L1 influence, while the similarity scaling an
indication of phonetic distances discernible to listeners. For example, Mandarin speakers
found both F0 and F0 (though no significant interaction between the two) an important cue
to the classification of level and falling contours, which is a reflection of the status of these
cues in their native tonal inventory.

L1 Influence
Five groups of listeners were recruited including native Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indo-European speakers. They were comparable regarding the formal training in
spoken Mandarin and off-campus opportunities to practice Mandarin. Therefore, we hypothesized that difference in their perceptual performance if confirmed, may be results of L1
influences.

Mandarin
Recall that Mandarin has three contour tones (high rising, low falling-rising, and high falling)
and one level tone (high level), which contrast with each other mainly in pitch slope and
direction. These two cues have been proved the most robust in perceptual distinction of
Mandarin tones. Hence, Mandarin listeners should be sensitive to the F0 (pitch slope)
changes. This prediction is confirmed in our data. Mandarin listeners did show the sharpest
sensitivity to the dimension of F0 in both tone identification and goodness-fit, suggesting
that they relied on pitch direction as one of the major perceptual cues to distinguish tones.
Strong influence of F0 onset is found in tone identification and goodness-fit of T4 exemplars,
but not in goodness-fit of T1 exemplars. As shown in Fig. 4, stimuli with a F0 smaller
than 12 Hz were predominantly identified as T1 irrespective of their F0 onsets. Such result
seems to suggest a categorical boundary at around 12 Hz between the level and falling tonal
contours. Boundaries at similar ranges were reported in neurolinguistic research on Mandarin
tone perception (Xi et al. 2010). Secondly, similarity scaling scores of both T1 and T4 relied
strongly on F0, but slightly less dependent on F0 onset in T4 and much less so in T1. The
strong but varied roles of F0 onset and F0 can be explained by the allophonic variations of T3
in Mandarin. T3 is a contour tone with mid-falling-rising pitch change, and has been argued
to be the only one that is phonologically low but realized as low/mid-rising or low/mid-falling
in phonetic contexts (Lin and Wang 1984; Cao 2002; Wang et al. 2012). These allophonic
variations of T3 may overlap with our falling pitches at lower F0 frequency ranges, and
confused our Mandarin speakers in goodness-fit of T4 tokens. In sum, F0 is the primary
perceptual cue that Mandarin speakers relied on in tone identification and goodness-fit. In

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:107-124

119

judging the fine details contained in equidistant exemplars of T4, phonological and phonetic
features of another tone seem influential in the process.

Cantonese
As reviewed earlier and generally agreed upon, of the 6 tones in Cantonese, 3 are level: high,
mid, low, and 2 are contour tones with low F0 onset: high-rising (low-mid), and extra-low
(low-falling). Cantonese speakers were predicted to be sensitive to pitch onsets and average
F0. In our results, however, Cantonese speakers seemed to find F0 much more influential
than F0 onset in tone identification. Only in goodness-fit of T1/T4 exemplars, did F0 onset
prove itself a more important cue than F0. Cantonese speakers have been reported unable
to distinguish various level tones in isolation, but the presence of three level tones may have
sharpened their sensitivity to the overall distinction between level tones and rising/low-falling
tones in Cantonese. In this sense, they may have grown more tolerant to phonetic variations
along the dimension of F0 onset at least in isolated contexts. Moreover, F0 onset and F0 only
interacted with each other significantly in T4 but not in T1 similarity rating. In addition to the
three level tones, Cantonese contains only a phonologically low tone (T21) with a phonetic
realization of a slight falling pitch contour. The association of a falling pitch with a certain F0
onset and the lack of steep pitch slopes, may together contribute to the interaction of F0 onset
and F0 in the similarity of T4 tokens and also to a somewhat stronger reliance on F0 onset.
So in our study, Cantonese speakers used general pitch direction as the main cue to
distinguish level tones from falling ones, whereas in fine differentiation of level tones they
resorted to F0 onset.

Thai
Thai listeners in this study labeled the majority of the stimuli as level tones, ranked the highest
of all five groups. They were, however, not sensitive to F0 onset in either tone categorization
or in similarity scaling of T4 exemplars. Only when judging T1 goodness-fit, were Thai
speakers affected by the two factors. Our results show that all pitches higher than 106 Hz and
with a slight falling (smaller than 24 Hz) were identified as belonging to the T1 category.
Only when the falling is steep (greater than 24 Hz), did Thai speakers considered the pitch
as high-falling as T4.
Recall that Thai has 5 phonemic tones: high (high rising), mid (mid-falling), low (low
falling), rising (low falling-rising), and falling (high falling). As Mandarin, Thai uses both
pitch slope and shape to contrast tones, e.g. as in the high falling tone. So, Thai speakers
should be sensitive to changes along the pitch slope dimension. But, their high and mid tones
are usually described as level tones with slight falling (Gandour et al. 1988; Gandour and
Ponglorpisit 1990). This means that phonetic falling at certain onset would not trigger the
recognition of a falling tone in Thai. The high-falling must be associated with higher onset
and steeper falling. Together this explains Thai speakers' tendency in classifying only stimuli
with higher than 112 Hz-onset and 30 Hz-F0 for a true falling tone.

Northern Vietnamese
The Northern Vietnamese speakers were greatly influenced by F0 onset and F0 in tone
identification, and also in similarity scaling of T1 exemplars. Their performance in tone
identification was the only group that showed a significant interaction between the two factors.

123

120

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:107-124

They were, however, only sensitive to F0, but not to F0 onset in similarity scaling of T4
exemplars.
Northern Vietnamese speakers relied on both F0 onset and F0 in categorizing tones: the
higher the F0 onset is, the greater the F0 must be (the steeper the pitch slope) so that a
stimulus may sound like a high-falling tone. The joint effect may be accounted for by the
Northern Vietnamese tonal system. Recall that the tone inventory of Northern Vietnamese
contains 6 tones contrasting in both pitch contours and voice quality: high level, high rising,
low falling, glottalized low falling, glottalized falling rising, and laryngealized falling rising.
As tones in syllables with voiceless onset have higher pitch values compared to tones with
a voiced onset, pitch height may be another cue to distinguish tones, though this cue may
not be as robust as the others. So, Vietnamese speakers should be sensitive to both F0 and
F0 in tone classification. Our results confirm this hypothesis. More interestingly, Northern
Vietnamese speakers showed a stronger preference to T4 than other groups. This may be
explained by the fact that there are more falling tones in Vietnamese, which provides its
speakers a greater tolerance to variations to the falling tone category. In similarity scaling,
F0 onset did not play a significant role, as F0 did, in goodness-fit of T4 exemplars. This
suggests that Vietnamese speakers may have relied on the fine phonetic details of L1 tone
prototypes in similarity scaling of non-native stimuli. So, though they perceived stimuli as
belonging to the T4 category, they detected the phonetic differences between a stimulus and
the prototypical falling tones.

Indo-European Languages
None of the Indo-European languages in our study uses pitch variations in differentiating
lexical meanings, but all languages involved have the distinction between general falling and
rising contours for pragmatic purposes. As expected, Indo-European speakers were sensitive
to F0 in tone categorization. This is in accord with the finding from other research (So and
Best 2010). Interestingly, our Indo-European speakers showed a very sharp sensitivity to F0
onset in T1 goodness-fit (even higher than all tonal language groups), in addition to their
sensitivity to F0. This suggests that these speakers' sensitivity should be mainly based on
physical acoustic features rather than on phonological or phonetic characteristics of tones.
Though on average, our Indo-European speakers had learned Mandarin for over a year, they
were not able to make usage of their limited knowledge in Mandarin tones.
To summarize, the five groups of listeners showed distinctive patterns in their perceptual
judgments of the synthesized tones. In T1/T4 identification, all groups except for Thai showed
strong sensitivity to variations of F0 onset, but only Mandarin and Thai listeners were sensitive
to F0. Results of similarity rating of T1 samples showed that all groups were significantly
influenced by variations of both F0 onset and F0. Results of similarity rating of T4 samples
showed that all groups were significantly influenced by F0, but only Mandarin, Cantonese
and Indo-European listeners were affected by changes to F0 onset. These preferences/ biases
towards changes along the two phonetic dimensions indicate clear and strong effects from
the listeners' native prosodic systems that use these dimensions for lexical or pragmatic
contrasts.
Recall that our Cantonese listeners learned Mandarin for a much longer time than other
groups. So, we hypothesized that their more-than-9-year Mandarin experience would enable
them to achieve a more native-like performance compared with those with much less experience in Mandarin. Our results show that the Cantonese group's performance was not more
similar, than those of non-native groups, as that of the native Mandarin speakers. Instead,
their perceptual patterns resembled more of those by the Indo-European group, who only

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:107-124

121

learned Mandarin for fewer than two years on average. Our previous studies as cited earlier
had shown that even very advanced Hong Kong Cantonese learners of Mandarin had difficulties in perceiving Mandarin high-level and high-falling tones. Our Cantonese participants
in this study had learned to speak the Standard Mandarin in primary schools, but did not
have many opportunities to practice it or to talk with native speakers. Cantonese group's formal Mandarin experience lent them little advantage in perceiving the synthesized Mandarin
tones. On the other hand, with a shorter period of Mandarin learning, N. Vietnamese and
Thai groups' performances were both much closer to that of the Mandarin speakers.
This pattern of results suggests that the listeners' L1 tonal systems assert a much stronger
effect on their perception than their formal experience in Mandarin does. This is further
confirmed by a lack of a significant correlation between duration of Mandarin leaning and
listeners' identification scores (Pearson correlation, r = -0.088, p = 0.293.). So, it is safe
and appropriate to conclude that the difference between the listener groups is not due to their
varying amount of Mandarin formal learning experience, but the different L1 tonal systems.

Influence of Other Factors
In addition to native linguistic experience, effects of other factors are also identified. Mandarin
has four phonemic tones: high-level, low-rising, mid-rising-falling, and high-falling. Pitch
direction should serve as the primary cue in tone discrimination whereas pitch height at onset
should play a less robust role than pitch slope. Therefore the unexpected significant role of
F0 in the Mandarin group should be a result of the factors other than their L1. This may be
due to the nature of the stimuli used in the study. Our T1 prototype is at around 110 Hz, so
stimuli with an F0 onset at around 110 Hz with minor acoustic variations should be more
likely to be perceived as a fair exemplar of T1. Other stimuli that are acoustically distant
from the prototype may be less likely to be perceived as T1. This is confirmed by the highest
percentage of T1 responses to stimuli with F0 onset at 112 and 118 Hz.
Indo-European listeners' performance also shows a significant role of F0. Their sensitivity
to the F0 dimension is interpreted as an outcome of their psychophysical ability in distinguishing between pitch differences (Wang 1976; Peng et al. 2010). Peng et al. (2010) studied
the categorical perception of Mandarin lexical tones, and reported that non-tone language
speakers performed the best in discriminating between the pure level and slightly falling pitch
contours. In our study, F0 of 0 Hz and F0 of 6 Hz did not trigger T4 identification. This
may be attributed to the experience in Mandarin our Indo-European listeners had gained.
Though limited, such experience may have lent them an advantage than naive speakers in
making general judgment on the level-falling distinction. But of course, our Indo-European
speakers' experience in Mandarin was still not sufficient to help direct their attention to
phonological features rather than phonetic details in tone categorization.
Cantonese listeners showed weaker sensitivity to the F0 dimension, compared with
Mandarin listeners. However, they were found sensitive to the difference in F0 between
12 and 18 Hz. This is in conformity with previous studies such as Peng et al. (2010), which
proposed that these values of F0 may fall into the range where native Cantonese listeners
would draw the boundary between Mandarin T1 and T4 categories.

Conclusion
Our study examined the perception of synthesized Mandarin tones by speakers from 5 L1
groups. In addition to roles of the L1, we also assessed effects of F0 onset and F0 in

123

122

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:107-124

categorizing pitch contours, by varying our stimuli in equidistant acoustic steps along these
two dimensions. Results reveal the main effect of L1 on perception of the level versus falling
tonal contrast. Speakers' sensitivity to the two phonetic dimensions of F0 and F0 also varies
across L1 groups.
We confirmed that L1 tonal/prosodic system affects the identification of the level and
falling pitch contours. For example, mid and low level tones in Thai are slightly falling,
which prompts the Thai participants to classify a majority of the stimuli to the T1 category.
Secondly, in both the pitch height and pitch slope dimensions, the status of pitch correlates
in the native tonal system greatly affects the perception of relevant cues in specific ways. For
example, Mandarin listeners showed greatest sensitivity to changes of pitch slope among all
listener groups, because pitch slope is the primary perceptual cue in contrasting Mandarin
tones.
As discussed previously, current L2 learning or perception models predict that the L1
phoneme categories alter the perceptual space in the perceptual learning of L2 sounds in
various ways, and L1 Selective Perception Routines as proposed by the ASP Model affect
the attention to the cues in the L2 input. Our research confirms that phonological features and
phonetic characteristics of both L1 and L2 jointly influence how L2 sounds are perceived. As
tonal contrasts may occur in various dimensions, a satisfactory account of L2 tone perception
should also take into consideration listeners' various degrees of attention to fine phonetic
details in a multidimensional way.
Finally, our study used synthesized pitches modified along specific phonetic dimensions.
These systematic continua enable an examination on not only how important a specific
phonetic cue is to our perception of certain sounds, but also how well we can distinguish
along the continuous changes of a specific phonetic cue. Future studies may use continua of
semitones that match more with the human perceptual scale. Production of tones could be
examined and correlated with analysis on tone perception, so as to discuss how L1 affects L2
production as well as to examine the relationship between tone perception and production.
