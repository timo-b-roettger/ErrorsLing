Purpose: In this study, the authors investigated (a) the effects of task, vocal distinctiveness
of the competing talkers, and meaningfulness of the competitor on older listeners'
identification of a target in the presence of competition and (b) the factors that are most
predictive of the variability in target identification observed among older listeners.
Method: Seventeen older and 5 younger adults identified a target in the presence of
a competing message. Identification was measured for 2 target types (message; talker),
3 vocal-distinctiveness levels (same talker; different talkers-same sex; different talkers-
different sex), and 2 competitors (meaningful speech; nonmeaningful time-reversed
speech). Multiple regression analyses were used to identify variables that were
predictive of intersubject variability.
Results: Significant age-related differences were found in the benefit obtained from
increasing vocal distinctiveness. Older listeners showed reduced target identification
when (a) the competitor was normal speech compared with time-reversed speech
and (b) the target was message identification compared with talker identification.
Variability among listeners in the older group was partially explained by auditory
and cognitive factors.
Conclusion: Age-related declines in multitalker environments are not solely due to
lower-level deficits in perceptual organization but are also a consequence of an
interaction between lower-level and higher-level processes.
KEY WORDS: aging, speech perception, hearing loss, perceptual organization

A

pervasive complaint among older listeners is that speech understanding in adverse environments becomes exceedingly difficult
with advancing age (e.g., Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics,
and Biomechanics [CHABA], 1988; Crandell, Henoch, & Dunkerson,
1992; Fozard & Gordon-Salant, 2001; Pichora-Fuller & Singh, 2006;
Plomp, 1978; Willott, 1996). Yet, the mechanisms that underlie these difficulties are not completely understood and may be due to a combination
of sensory, perceptual, and cognitive factors. A deeper understanding of
the mechanisms that underlie older listeners' receptive communication
problems is warranted, given the social and emotional consequences of
impaired communication on the aged and their quality of life (Corso,
1977; Jacobs-Conduit, 1984; Pichora-Fuller & Schow, 2002).

Older listeners' speech-understanding problems have
been investigated from diverse perspectives (cf. Bergman,
1980). One approach has been to identify where in the
system speech-understanding deficits arise (e.g., CHABA,
1988; Humes, 1996). Under this approach, changes in
the auditory periphery, central auditory nervous system,
and /or modality-general cortical regions may be implicated. The relative contributions of these "regions"
have been explored in two primary ways. Under the first
method, performance is compared between older and
younger listeners for specific experimental manipulations. For example, the finding that older listeners show
less improvement in identification accuracy for modulated noise maskers (e.g., Dubno, Horowitz, & Ahlstrom,
2002; Duquesnoy, 1983; Summers & Molis, 2004) may be
evidence of age-related degradations in the processing of
temporal information (e.g., George, Festen, & Houtgast,
2006; see also Pichora-Fuller, Schneider, MacDonald,
Brown, & Pass, 2007, who simulated such age-related
temporal distortions). Under the second method, the factors accounting for the variable performance among older
listeners are identified. A number of studies have found
that the majority of variance among older listeners in
speech-in-noise tasks can be accounted for by changes
in absolute hearing sensitivity (e.g., Divenyi & Haupt,
1997a, 1997b; Dreschler & Plomp, 1980, 1985; Humes, 2002;
Humes & Christopherson, 1991; Humes & Roberts,
1990; Humes et al., 1994; van Rooij & Plomp, 1990, 1992).
However, the role of cognitive factors may become more
apparent when careful steps are taken to ensure audibility of the signal in older listeners with threshold elevations (e.g., Humes, Lee, & Coughlin, 2006) or when
older listeners with normal-hearing sensitivity are included (e.g., George et al., 2007). For example, Humes
et al. (2006) recently showed that factors related to
memory accounted for much of the variance in speechunderstanding among individual older listeners. Others
have also highlighted the contributions of age-related
declines in speed of processing (e.g., Wingfield, 1996)
and attention (e.g., McDowd & Shaw, 2000) to older listeners' speech-understanding problems.
Taken together, both lower-level (auditory) and higherlevel (cognitive) factors have been shown to contribute--
albeit to varying degrees--to age-related declines in speech
understanding. Undoubtedly, speech understanding in
adverse environments encompasses a set of fundamental processes that range from the basic to the more abstract (see Pichora-Fuller, 2003; Wingfield & Tun, 2007,
for reviews). Rather than focusing exclusively on overall
changes to message comprehension, understanding agerelated declines can be augmented by also exploring
changes to its constituent operations.
One such intermediate process involves perceptual
organization of the complex signals. In environments

436

with more than one talker, listeners receive a signal that
carries the acoustic mark of the different talkers whose
voices may overlap in frequency and time. In his model of
auditory scene analysis, Bregman (1990) proposed that
both lower-level and higher-level processes are involved
in partitioning the complex signal into distinct auditory
objects. Initially, the complex signal is organized on the
basis of physical cues, including its spectral and temporal characteristics. Further organization is achieved
through the use of schema that operate on the basis of
stored prototypes or mental representations derived from
past experience.
Several physical grouping cues facilitate the perceptual organization of multitalker environments (e.g.,
Darwin, 2008). Potentially, age-related changes in peripheral encoding, including deficits in hearing sensitivity and spectrotemporal processing, may result in
an impoverished representation of the complex signal
and may effectively degrade the use of physical grouping
cues. A difference in the fundamental frequency (F0) of
competing talkers is one physical grouping cue that older
listeners may use less effectively. In younger listeners
with normal hearing, recognition of competing sentences
(Bird & Darwin, 1998; Brokx & Nootebom, 1982) as well
as competing vowels (Assmann & Summerfield, 1990;
Culling & Darwin, 1993; de Cheveigne, Kawahara,
Tsuzaki, & Aikawa, 1997; Meddis & Hewitt, 1992;
Scheffers, 1983) improves as F0 is parametrically increased. Past work has shown that cochlear hearing loss
appears to deleteriously affect perceptual organization
on the basis of F0 cues (Arehart, 1998; Arehart, King, &
McLean-Mudgett, 1997; Arehart, Rossi-Katz, & SwenssonPrutsman, 2005; Mackersie, Prida, & Stiles, 2001; RossiKatz & Arehart, 2005; Summers & Leek, 1998). Research
also supports the idea that age may affect the use of F0
cues (Summers & Leek, 1998; Vongpaisal & PichoraFuller, 2007; see also Divenyi & Simon, 1999).
Alain and colleagues (Alain, Dyson, & Snyder, 2006;
Alain, McDonald, Ostroff, & Schneider, 2004) theorized
that older adults may rely on more controlled processes
or schema in perceptual organization to compensate for
lower-level deficits in F0 processing. Electrophysiological evidence reported by Snyder and Alain (2005) corroborates this possibility. In younger listeners, perceptual
organization of competing vowels appears to be guided
by automatic primitive processing of physical grouping
cues (i.e., F0). Conversely, older listeners appear to rely
on more controlled processes in perceptual organization
to compensate for deficits in the automatic processing of
physical grouping cues. The notion that older listeners
may rely more on higher-level processes to perceptually
organize competing messages leads to an important
question: What are the consequences of this recruitment
on subsequent operations (e.g., lexical decoding)?

In line with a basic information-processing model in
which resources are finite and shared, allocation of resources to earlier processing stages may place a greater
drain on later operations. This idea has been recently
applied to the study of older listeners' general speechin-noise difficulties (e.g., McCoy et al., 2005; Murphy,
Craik, Li, & Schneider, 2000; Pichora-Fuller, Schneider,
& Daneman, 1995; Schneider, Daneman, Murphy, &
Kwong See, 2000; Wingfield, McCoy, Peelle, Tun & Cox,
2006; see also Pichora-Fuller, 2007, for a recent review).
The approach used in these studies considers not only
the contribution of sensory degradations but also the functional effect of reallocating a limited store of processing
resources to the recovery of impoverished information at
the periphery (compare Rabbit's "effortfulness hypothesis," 1968, 1991).
The current study has two primary goals: (a) to explore the contribution of lower-level and higher-level
processes to age-related changes in perceptual organization and speech understanding within a multitalker
environment and (b) to characterize what factors are
most predictive of these changes. Specifically, we quantify age-related decrements in identifying a target signal
as a function of the distinctiveness of the competing talkers, the meaningfulness of the competing message, and
the nature of the target signal. Furthermore, we consider the extent to which auditory and cognitive factors
are predictive of individual variability in target identification among older listeners.
The role of lower-level deficits is measured by varying the distinctiveness of the competing talkers' vocal
characteristics. Following Brungart (2001), we use the coordinated response measure (CRM; Bolia, Nelson, Ericson,
& Simpson, 2000) to assess speech perception of a target
talker in the presence of a competing talker. Brungart
demonstrated that the identification of a target message
improved as the voices of the competing talkers became
increasingly distinct. Humes et al. (2006) employed the
CRM to examine the effects of age on the use of vocal
distinctiveness in target message identification. Their
study included two levels of vocal distinctiveness: two
different talkers of the same sex and two different talkers of a different sex. The results showed that both a
group of young listeners and a group of elderly listeners
were better at identifying target words when the target
and competing talkers were spoken by talkers of a different sex compared with when the talkers were of the
same sex. However, the amount of improvement was less
in the older group of listeners. In the present study, we
explore how age impacts the usefulness of such cues for
three levels of talker distinctiveness within the CRM (cf.
Brungart, 2001): (a) target and competing message are
spoken by the same person, (b) target and competing
message are spoken by different talkers of the same sex,
and (c) target and competing message are spoken by

talkers of a different sex. Older listeners are predicted to
show reduced benefit from increasing the distinctiveness of the talkers' vocal characteristics to the extent
that degradations in peripheral encoding restrict the
primitive processing of physical grouping cues.
We also hypothesize that factors other than the vocal distinctiveness of the competing talkers will influence
older listeners' performance. Accordingly, the nature of
the listening task is manipulated in two additional ways.
First, the linguistic meaningfulness of the competing
message is altered through time reversal. Time reversal
effectively minimizes the linguistic content of a message
and generally maintains its spectral properties, if not
its fine temporal structure (e.g., Rhebergen, Versfeld, &
Dreschler, 2005). Second, the nature of the target is
changed from identification of the target message ("what")
to identification of the target talker ("who").
Past work has shown that age-related decrements in
message understanding may be more pronounced when
the competing message is meaningful (Coughlin, 2004;
Larsby, Hallgren, Lyxell, & Arlinger, 2005; Tun, O' Kane,
& Wingfield, 2002; Tun & Wingfield, 1999). Tun et al.
(2002) posited that older listeners were more susceptible
to higher-level interference from a meaningful competitor. The deleterious effect of a meaningful masker on
older listeners' identification of a target message can also
be interpreted in the context of informational masking
whereby speech understanding is impeded by factors other
than physical (i.e., energetic) masking (Li, Daneman, Qi,
& Schneider, 2004; Schneider, Li, & Daneman, 2007). If
peripheral degradations in the encoding of the target
signal are the sole contributor to older listeners' poorer
performance, there should be little if any improvement
in performance from manipulating the linguistic content
of the competing message. However, other factors beyond
physical grouping cues also contribute to perceptual organization. Therefore, we expect that older listeners' target identification will improve when linguistic content of
the competitor is removed.
In multitalker environments, older listeners' problems are not necessarily restricted to understanding a
talker's message but may also include problems discriminating and/or identifying who the talker is (e.g., Jerger
et al., 1993; Yonan & Sommers, 2000). Work by Pilotti,
Beyer, and Yasunami (2001) and Sommers (1997) suggests that older listeners' ability to encode a talker 's vocal characteristics is strongly tied to the conditions under
which talker identification is measured--that is, agerelated deficits are more pronounced under more difficult listening conditions. Both Pilotti et al. and Sommers
proposed that older adults are at a greater disadvantage
in more complex listening tasks due to an interplay between lower-level and higher-level processing: Increased
task complexity requires a greater draw on processing

resources to recover peripheral signals that are presumably degraded in the older adults. Younger listeners are
not immune to such effects. Shafiro and Gyri (2007)
provided evidence of such "performance costs" in younger listeners using the CRM corpus. By increasing the
processing load, the accuracy with which listeners
detected and identified key information decreased (see
also Gallun, Mason, & Kidd, 2007).

Method
Listeners
Two groups of listeners participated in this study.
One group consisted of 5 young adults: 4 female and
1 male, aged 23-25 years, m = 23.8 (s = 0.84). Younger
listeners were required to be at least 18 years of age and
have normal-hearing sensitivity, which is defined as
audiometric thresholds of 20 dB HL (American National Standards Institute [ANSI], 2004) or better at octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz, inclusive. The
primary purpose of including the younger listener
group was to corroborate that the benefit listeners receive from physical grouping cues in multitalker environments diminishes with age. However, an added
purpose was to assess the feasibility of the experimental
tasks before implementing them with the older group.
Accordingly, the results of the younger group are presented in a mostly descriptive, rather than inferential,
manner.

In the present study, the accuracy with which older
listeners identify a target talker ("who") is measured as a
function of the competing talkers' vocal distinctiveness
and the linguistic meaningfulness of the competitor. Comparison of scores between the target-message and targettalker tasks will provide insight into the scope of older
listeners' difficulties in multitalker environments. Older
listeners are predicted to have more problems identifying
the target message compared with the target talker. Competing message identification is presumed to be more resource demanding given its requisite level of lexical access.
Finally, the extent to which listener age, hearing
status, and cognitive ability are predictive of age-related
differences in perceptual organization and speech
understanding is considered. We predict that the largest
amount of variability among the older listeners will be
accounted for by a combination of both auditory and cognitive factors. This prediction is based on the putative
contribution of both lower-level and higher-level processes
to perceptual organization.

The other group consisted of 17 healthy older adults:
10 female and 7 male, aged 65-83, m = 74.0 (s = 5.48). For
inclusion in the older group, listeners were required to be
at least 65 years of age with no greater than a moderately
severe hearing loss in the test ear (see Table 1). Listeners
with hearing loss demonstrated test results consistent
with a cochlear site of lesion: absence of an air-bone gap
exceeding 10 dB at any frequency, normal tympanometry,

and absence of otoacoustic emissions in regions of threshold loss. All older listeners passed a screening of gross
cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975), rated their
overall health as good or better, and reported no history of stroke, serious head trauma, or neurodegenerative disease.

Stimuli and Apparatus
The experiments are based on the CRM, an intelligibility task that was originally developed for multitalker communication research (Moore, 1981). The
CRM is a publicly available speech corpus (Bolia et al.,
2000), and all stimuli have an identical phrase structure:
"Ready [call sign] go to [color] [number] now." There are
256 unique phrases in the corpus (8 call signs ["arrow,"
" baron," "charlie," "eagle," " hopper," " laker," " ringo,"
& "tiger"] x 4 colors [" blue," "green," "red," " white"] x
8 numbers [1-8]). Eight different talkers (4 male and
4 female) were recorded producing each of the 256 phrases
for a total of 2,048 available phrases. Following the original recordings, all phrases were band-pass filtered (80-
8,000 Hz), were set to the same comparable lengths, and
were root-mean-square (RMS)-equalized.
Prior to generating the experimental stimuli, two
changes were made to the original corpus. First, the sampling rate of the CRM files was decreased from 40 kHz to
16 kHz while maintaining a 16-bit resolution to maximize
computational efficiency. Second, 350 samples at the beginning and 700 samples at the end of each phrase were
removed in order to compensate for audible noise at the
onset/offset of a large number of CRM files (most likely
because of the way in which the phrases were originally
recorded). Evaluation of the down-sampled, "no-click" signals suggested that both modifications were successful
and did not affect speech intelligibility or speech quality.
All subsequent stimuli that were derived from the CRM
corpus were based on the modified corpus.
Both normal and time-reversed stimuli were generated. The normal stimuli were original CRM phrases
drawn from the modified corpus and used as both targets
and competitors in the message- and talker-identification
tasks. Time-reversed stimuli served only as competitors
and were created by reading in a normal stimulus and
re-recording it backwards in time via a customized
MATLAB program. As shown in Figure 1, the amplitude spectrum of a normal CRM phrase is the same as
its time-reversed counterpart. All signals were RMSequalized and presented at 65 dB SPL to the younger
listeners with normal hearing. Because of threshold
elevations among the older listeners, the 65 dB SPL
stimuli were amplified using the National Acoustic
Laboratories-Revised (NAL-R) prescriptive formula

based on individual thresholds1 (Byrne & Dillon, 1986).
The frequency-shaped amplification was implemented
through digital filtering (via a linear-phase finite impulse
response [FIR] filter) prior to the experiment. Stimuli
were customized for each individual listener and were
stored on a personal computer prior to being played out
over earphones.
The signals were played out in the following way: Two
different signals were sent simultaneously from a custom
MATLAB program to separate channels of a Tucker-Davis
Technologies (TDT; Alachua, FL) microprocessor (TDT
RX6). Following digital-to-analog conversion and low-pass
filtering (cutoff = 8,000 Hz) by the microprocessor, the signals were routed separately through programmable attenuators (TDT PA5) and then combined in a mixer (TDT SM5)
before being delivered to the test ear of the listener with
Sennheiser (Sennheiser Electronic Corporation, Wedemark,
Germany) HD-25-SP earphones. In older listeners with
symmetrical hearing thresholds (difference < 20 dB HL),
the test ear was randomly selected. In older listeners with
asymmetrical hearing thresholds, the ear with the better
hearing thresholds was selected as the test ear (cf. Table 1).
Both signals were played simultaneously and were aligned
at their onsets. No further corrections were made to adjust
the talkers' speaking rate. The relative level of both signals was equal (0 dB SNR) for all experimental conditions.

Tasks and Procedure
At the initial session, the older listeners underwent
a comprehensive audiometric evaluation and completed
the Mini-Mental State Examination to determine if
they met the study 's eligibility requirements. Qualified
listeners gave informed consent and were scheduled to
return for additional testing sessions. For all tasks, listeners were seated in a sound-attenuated booth in front
of a computer monitor. The monitor displayed a graphical user interface (GUI), which listeners navigated with
a computer mouse. Daily test sessions were approximately
1 hr and did not exceed 2 hr. Listeners were compensated
$10/hr for their participation.

Identification of the Target Message
The message identification task required listeners to identify the color-number coordinates that were
1
Even with the NAL-R frequency-shaped amplification, several listeners
may have received limited audibility (<15 dB SL) in the higher frequencies
(Listener K  3 kHz; Listeners A, E, N, and P  2 kHz). We identified these
cases of limited audibility in the following way: Each listener 's thresholds
were compared to noise shaped to have the same long-term average speech
spectrum of the unamplified CRM corpus and the same noise amplified
based on the listener 's thresholds according to the NAL-R routine. The plots
for the comparison used the 21-band Speech-Intelligibility Index (ANSI
S3.5, 1997) as the basis of the auditory filters, with filter shapes based on
Moore and Glasberg 's (1983) roex filter approximations.

associated with a specific call sign from the CRM. Listeners received two simultaneous signals, only one of
which included the specific call sign. Listeners were told
that the Baron call sign would always denote the target
message. The competing message differed on two dimensions: (a) physical (vocal) distinctiveness and (b) linguistic meaningfulness. The competing message was
produced by the same speaker as that of the target message (SS), a different speaker of the same sex (DS), or a
different speaker of a different sex (DD). Vocal distinctiveness of the competing talkers was presumed to be
negligible in the SS condition and most pronounced in
the DD condition, with the DS condition falling between
these two extremes. Additionally, the competitor was
either another phrase drawn from the CRM corpus in
which the message's meaning was preserved or was a
time-reversed version of a CRM phrase in which the overall linguistic meaningfulness of the message was removed. For both types of competitors, the selected phrase
had to use a non-Baron call sign and had to include a
color-number combination that was unique from the
target.
At the outset of each session, listeners were
presented with a short block (40 trials) of target phrases
in quiet (8 talkers x 5 target phrases) and a short block of
practice trials. Listeners were required to identify the
target message in quiet with at least 90% accuracy to
verify that the amplification scheme adequately restored
signal audibility. This criterion also established that listeners were able to discern all images on the GUI and
were proficient in controlling the computer mouse. For
the experimental trials, listeners received two competing

440

phrases. Listeners were instructed to pick which color-
number pair was associated with the Baron call sign. A
signal could only be listened to once before a response was
required. No feedback was provided. For both the normal
and time-reversed competitors, listeners received two
blocks of 128 trials each. Stimuli were presented without
replacement so that each unique color-number combination associated with the Baron call sign was included
for the 8 different talkers (4 colors x 8 numbers x
8 talkers = 256 trials). Within a block, the vocal distinctiveness of the competing messages (SS, DS, or DD)
varied randomly from trial to trial.

Identification of the Target Talker
Similar to the target-message task, listeners were
presented with two competing signals and were to identify, by name, the talker associated with the Baron call
sign. The competitor was varied in terms of its vocal distinctiveness and linguistic meaningfulness. To control
for the frequency with which listeners were exposed to a
given speaker, all listeners completed this task after the
message identification task. The talker identification
task involved three different phases: (a) name selection,
(b) training with pretest/posttest, and (c) experimental
testing. Most listeners completed all three phases within
a single test session.
Name selection. Pilot testing with all 8 talkers was
carried out to determine which 4 talkers were most vocally distinctive. The vocal distinctiveness of the CRM
talkers was evaluated in a small group of young, normalhearing listeners who were recruited solely for the pilot

testing. Two phrases were sequentially presented, and
the pilot group reported if they were produced by the
same talker or two different talkers. Subsequently, 2 male
talkers (CRM Talkers 0 and 1) and 2 female talkers (CRM
Talkers 4 and 7) were selected as targets on the basis of
their vocal distinctiveness. At the start of the experimental session, listeners heard five sample phrases from
each of the 4 talkers before being prompted to provide
the examiner with a name for the talker. Most listeners
reported that they selected a particular name by associating the talkers' vocal characteristics with an individual they knew personally or by a name that is particularly
descriptive. For example, many listeners reported that
Talker 3 had a higher-pitch voice such that it reminded
them of a granddaughter or caused the listeners to select
a "childlike" name. The names that individual listeners
selected were retained throughout the session.
Training, pretest, and posttest. Following name selection, listeners underwent training to pair the talkers
with their names. The general structure of the training session was similar to that developed by Yonan and
Sommers (2000). During training, listeners were presented with two concatenated phrases in which the talker
always used the Baron call sign. At the same time, the
talker's name was prominently displayed on the computer screen. When the auditory/visual signals ended,
listeners were prompted (via a "play" button) to listen
to the next talker and read their name. Listeners were
presented with 64 pairs of trials so that each named
talker was heard 32 times (128 trials/4 talkers). The
order with which the talkers were played out was randomized. A pretest and posttest administered immediately before and after training was used to gauge the
training's effectiveness. For both the pretest and posttest, listeners were presented with 64 trials in quiet
(4 talkers x 16 phrases) and were instructed to select the
name of the talker using the Baron call sign from a closed
set of responses. A signal was presented only once before
a response was required and no feedback was provided.
Most listeners showed substantial improvements in identification accuracy from the pretest to the posttest. Several listeners scored remarkably high on the pretest
(>90%) such that the benefit of training was restricted.
Inspection of the pretest and posttest scores suggests
that training was never detrimental. To proceed with the
experimental tasks, listeners had to demonstrate at
least 90% accuracy on the posttest. Two of the 17 older
listeners could not achieve this criterion so did not complete the experimental portion of the talker identification task.
Experimental trials. After demonstrating their proficiency in identifying the four talkers in quiet, listeners
were assessed on how well they identified the target
talker in the presence of a competing talker. Two blocks

of trials were presented, with the type of competitor (normal or time-reversed) kept constant within a block. The
order with which listeners received the normal or timereversed competitor was randomized across listeners.
Each block consisted of 128 trials. Stimuli were presented
without replacement so that each unique color-number
combination associated with the Baron call sign was
included for the 4 named talkers (4 colors x 8 numbers x
4 named talkers). Within a block, the vocal distinctiveness of the competing talkers (SS, DS, or DD) varied
randomly from trial to trial. The competing talker could
be a familiar (i.e., named) talker using a non-Baron call
sign or 1 of the 4 CRM talkers who did not receive a name
designation.

Cognitive Measures
Cognitive abilities were evaluated with the standard form of the MicroCog Assessment (Powell et al.,
1993), which is made up of 18 subtests. Five indexical
scores of cognitive functioning are derived from combinations of the various subtests and include attention /
mental control, memory, reasoning /calculation, spatial
processing, and reaction time.
The MicroCog Assessment was administered and
scored according to the procedures described in the examiner 's manual. Listeners were seated at the same
computer station that was used for the competing speech
tasks. All questions and instructions were displayed on
the computer monitor. Listeners were presented with
preprinted instructions that explained how to select their
responses. The instructions also emphasized that both
accuracy and speed were important to the test but that
accuracy was more important. Before starting the test,
listeners were queried as to whether specific images and
sounds were discernible. All listeners reported that the
images were visible. The auditory signals, presented over
loudspeakers, were adjusted to be at a comfortable listening level. During test administration, listeners could
elect to pause a subtest unless otherwise noted. An announced break occurred at the midpoint of the 18 subtests. All listeners completed the MicroCog assessment
within 1 hr.

Results
In this section, we report older listeners' identification of a target signal as a function of the distinctiveness
of the competing talkers, the meaningfulness of the competing message, and the nature of the target signal. Following presentation of the group results, the variability
in performance among individual older listeners is considered. Finally, we describe a series of multiple regression models; these models assess the contribution of

auditory and cognitive factors to the prediction of variance
among older listeners.

Target-Message Identification and DVoice
Benefit (Baseline)
Target message identification was measured at three
levels of the competing-talkers' vocal distinctiveness.
Figure 2 displays the percentage of trials in which the
younger and older groups identified the color-number coordinates of the target message as a function of the
vocal distinctiveness between the target and the normal (meaningful) competitor.
In both groups, identification of the target message
was poorest when the competing message was spoken by
the same talker as that of the target (ScoreSS = E30%).
Both groups showed monotonic improvements in target
message identification as the vocal distinctiveness increased. For both groups, identification accuracy was
best for the DD level of vocal distinctiveness (Younger
ScoreDD = 88%; Older ScoreDD = 52%). The total improvement in identification accuracy due to increased
vocal distinctiveness was defined as DVoice Benefit
(ScoreDD - ScoreSS). As shown in Figure 2, the younger
and older groups differed in the extent of their DVoice
Benefit. The younger listener group showed approximately 60 percentage points of DVoice Benefit (from 31%
to 88%), whereas the older listener group showed only
25 percentage points of DVoice Benefit (from 27% to 52%).
A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance
(RM ANOVA) was conducted on the arcsine-transformed
Figure 2. Percentage of trials in which both the color-number
coordinates of the target message were correct in the younger and older
groups as a function of the competing talkers' vocal distinctiveness.

percent-correct scores2 (Studebaker, 1985) to examine
the within-subject effect of vocal distinctiveness and the
between-subjects effect of listener group on identification of the target message. There was a strong main effect of vocal distinctiveness such that increasing the
vocal distinctiveness of the competing talkers significantly
improves identification of the target message, F(2, 40) =
73.6, p < .001, partial h2 = .786. However, consistent with
the significant main effect of listener group, the older
group showed poorer overall identification of the target
message compared with the younger group when collapsing across levels of vocal distinctiveness, F(1, 20) =
13.9, p = .001, partial h2 = .411. Furthermore, DVoice
Benefit was significantly lower for the older group as
supported by the Listener Group x Vocal Distinctiveness
interaction, F(2, 40) = 2.6, p < .001, partial h2 = .387.
Compared with the younger group, the older group
demonstrated poorer overall identification accuracy and
reduced DVoice Benefit when both the target and competitor were meaningful. What remains to be determined
is whether such decrements persist under different listening conditions. Using identification accuracy of a target message against a meaningful competitor as the
baseline, changes in older listeners' performance were
calculated as a function of (a) minimizing the competing message's meaningfulness through time reversal
(DMeaning Benefit) and (b) shifting what constitutes
the target signal from the message to the talker (DTarget
Type Benefit). The remainder of the analyses focus exclusively on the older adults, with the results of the younger listeners presented for descriptive purposes only.

Target Message Identification
and DMeaning Benefit
Figure 3 displays the percentage of trials in which
the younger and older groups selected the correct color-
number coordinates as a function of both the vocal
distinctiveness of the competing signals as well as
the meaningfulness of the competitor. With the timereversed competitor, the younger listener group showed
near-perfect identification of the target message across
all levels of vocal distinctiveness. By contrast, the performance of the older listener group differed as a function of the vocal distinctiveness of the competing signals.
The total improvement in identification accuracy due to
removing the meaningfulness of the competing message was defined as DMeaning Benefit (ScoreTREV -
ScoreNORM). The younger group showed considerable
DMeaning Benefit when the vocal distinctiveness of

across all levels of vocal distinctiveness (42, 43, and
38 percentage points, respectively).
A mixed-model RM ANOVA examined the effect of
competitor type and vocal distinctiveness on the older
group's identification of the target message. Significant
main effects were found for both competitor type, F(1,16) =
482.1, p < .001, partial h2 = .986, and vocal distinctiveness,
F(2, 32) = 69.83, p < .001, partial h2 = .814. The lack of
a Competitor Type x Vocal Distinctiveness interaction,
F(2, 32) = 0.102, p > .05, partial h2 = .006, was consistent
with the considerable benefit that the older group received from minimizing the meaningfulness of the competitor (DMeaning Benefit) across all levels of vocal
distinctiveness. Stated differently, DVoice Benefit in the
older group was comparable regardless of the meaningfulness of the competitor. Next we consider whether additional benefit was realized through alteration of what
constitutes the target signal.

Target Identification and DTarget
Type Benefit

the competing talkers was less pronounced (SS: E65 percentage points; DS: E47 percentage points). DMeaning
Benefit was noticeably smaller at the DD level of vocal
distinctiveness in the younger group (E11 percentage
points), consistent with the group's high accuracy of
identification with the normal competitor at this level.
In the older group, DMeaning Benefit was comparable

The accuracy with which the target talker ("who")
was correctly identified with both the normal and timereversed competitor is displayed in Figure 4 as a function of the vocal distinctiveness between the competing
talkers (DS and DD). The SS condition was not included
in the analysis because the target talker was the same as
the competitor. The younger group identified the target
talker with high accuracy across all conditions. For both
the DS and DD conditions, target-talker identification in
the older listeners was better when the competitor was

nonmeaningful (see Figure 4, right panel), compared
with when the competitor was meaningful (see Figure 4,
left panel). With the normal competitor, target talker
identification in the older listeners decreased as vocal
distinctiveness increased (DS = 77%, DD = 68%) and
was relatively stable with the time-reversed competitor
(DS = 91%, DD = 94%).
The primary reason for including the target talker
task was to compare how identification of a target message compared to identification of a target talker at different levels of vocal distinctiveness. However, a main
difference between the target message and target talker
identification tasks was the number of response choices
available to a listener. In the message identification task,
listeners were instructed to select from 32 unique color-
number coordinates, whereas in the talker identification
task, listeners were confined to four choices. To facilitate
comparisons between these two tasks, the data from the
message identification task were reanalyzed to consider
the proportion of times in which listeners correctly identified the "color" coordinate, irrespective of the number
coordinate. As the CRM task includes four levels of color,
chance performance would be 25% and, hence, comparable between the message and talker tasks. Even when the
target message scores were recalculated, they closely followed the older group's original color-number scores for
the DS and DD conditions (cf. Figures 2 and 5).
The accuracy with which listeners identified a target signal was plotted as a function of vocal distinctiveness for both the target talker tasks and target message
tasks. The extent to which changing the type of target influenced identification can be seen by comparing
Figure 5. Percentage of trials in which the target was correctly
identified in the younger and older listeners as a function of the
competing talkers' vocal distinctiveness. Results (with SDs) are shown
for both the target message ("what") and the target talker ("who")
tasks. The younger group is plotted for descriptive purposes.

the older group's performance at a given level of vocal
distinctiveness (DTarget Type Benefit = ScoreTALKER -
ScoreMESSAGE). As shown in Figure 5, the older listener
group shows substantial DTarget Type Benefit (43 percentage points) in the DS condition; DTarget Type Benefit is
noticeably less in the DD condition (13 percentage points).
A mixed-model RM ANOVA was performed for the
group of older listeners to examine the effect of target
type and vocal distinctiveness on target identification.
Consistent with the main effect of target type, F(1, 14) =
61.0, p < .001, partial h2 = .813, older listeners showed a
significant improvement in identification when the target was the talker rather than the message. Although
the main effect of vocal distinctiveness was not significant, F(1, 14) = 2.5, p > .05, partial h2 = .154, the Target
Type x Vocal Distinctiveness interaction is F(1, 14) =
154.5, p < .001, partial h2 = .917, suggesting that DTarget
Type Benefit differs between the two levels of vocal
distinctiveness.
As a group, the accuracy with which older listeners
correctly identified a target signal presented against a
competitor significantly improved with (a) removing the
meaningfulness of the competitor and (b) changing what
constitutes the target signal. However, notwithstanding
these findings, another notable trend emerged: The extent to which identification accuracy improved was considerably different among individual older listeners.

Individual Variability
Although the group of older listeners showed significantly poorer identification of the target message,
individual listeners varied in both their overall performance and the extent to which identification accuracy
changed with manipulating vocal distinctiveness, meaningfulness of the competitor, and/or the type of target
signal. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify variables that were predictive of intersubject variability within the older group. The set of predictor variables
included the absolute age of the listener as well as auditory and cognitive factors.
Hearing sensitivity in older adults was represented
by averaging auditory thresholds at 1, 2, and 4 kHz (i.e.,
high-frequency pure-tone average [HF PTA]). As reported
in Table 1, there was noted variability in the audiometric
thresholds of individual older listeners. Although there
was a positive relationship between age and degree of
hearing loss, age alone only accounted for 43% of the variance in pure-tone average (Pearson's correlation coefficient: r = .659, p = .002).3
3
Identification of a target message in modulated speech-shaped noise
(MSSN) was originally included as another auditory measure. However,
given the high identification accuracy with which older listeners performed
in this condition as well as a significant relationship between HF PTA and
MSSN, only the HF PTA measure was retained.

Five cognitive indices were derived from the 18 subtests
of the MicroCog assessment: attention, memory, reasoning, visuospatial processing, and reaction time. Listeners' raw scores were transformed into standardized
(scaled) scores to permit comparison across the five indices, with the mean of each index equal to 100 and the
SD set to 15 (Powell et al., 1993). Figure 6 shows the distribution of the individual older listeners' standardized
scores on each of the five indices. The average score of
the younger listeners is shown with asterisks. In each
panel, the solid line represents the mean score of 100,
with the two dashed lines at 85 and 115 representing
1 SD below and above the mean, respectively. Across
the indices, there is noted variability in the standardized scores for the older listeners: Attention, m = 99 (s = 10);
Reasoning, m = 97 (s = 14); Memory, m = 94 (s = 13); Spatial
Processing, m = 91 (s = 17); Reaction Time, m = 85 (s = 14).
Pearson product-moment correlations were computed for older listeners' scores on each cognitive index
as well as the absolute age of the older listeners. The
correlations matrix is shown in Table 2. Among the older
listeners, there is no correlation between age and any of
the five indices. Additionally, the only relationship between the cognitive indices is found for memory and attention, which reveals a moderate relationship between
these two predictor variables. As a consequence, all five
indices were retained as predictor variables in the regression models.

Identification Accuracy
The roles that age, auditory sensitivity, and cognitive ability play in identification accuracy of a target
message presented against a meaningful competitor were
considered in a series of multiple regression analyses.
The dependent variable was the older listeners' arcsinetransformed percent-correct scores at the DD level of
vocal distinctiveness. The variability in the older listeners' scores was especially pronounced in this condition, ranging from a low of 29% to a high of 90% (cf. error
bars in Figure 2). The results of seven regression models
are presented in Table 3. Inferring the role of specific

predictor variables on older listeners' performance
is moderated by the relatively small number of data
points (17) compared with the number of predictor variables (7). In light of this, and to facilitate comparison
across models with different numbers of predictor variables, the relative amount of variance accounted for
by the predictors is discussed in terms of adjusted R2
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001).
Model 1 involved a simple regression with age as the
sole predictor variable. Age significantly predicted identification accuracy in older listeners, accounting for 54%
of the adjusted variance in individual scores. Model 2
used auditory sensitivity as the sole predictor variable
and also was a significant predictor, accounting for 42% of
the adjusted variance in older listeners' scores. Model 3,
which combined auditory sensitivity and age, accounted
for 57% of the adjusted variance. Cognitive variables did
not significantly predict identification accuracy in the
older listeners when considered alone (Model 4) or when
considered in combination with age (Model 5).
The final two regression models included all auditory and cognitive measures and either included age as a
predictor (Model 6) or did not (Model 7). When all predictor variables were included, the model accounted for a
total of 65% of the adjusted variance in listeners' scores.
Only the HF PTA variable was significant. When the
contribution of age was excluded from the model, the

auditory and cognitive variables accounted for the same
amount of adjusted variance in listeners' scores as when
age was included (65%). In Model 7, HF PTA and the
cognitive indices of reaction time and reasoning were
significant.

Relative Benefit
As with overall identification accuracy, older listeners also varied considerably in the amount by which identification accuracy changed with specific experimental
manipulations. As shown in Figure 7, individual listeners
received variable benefit from increasing the competing
talkers' vocal distinctiveness (see top panel), minimizing
the linguistic meaningfulness of the competitor (see middle panel), and changing the type of target (see bottom
panel).
As shown in the top panel of Figure 7, a demarcation
among listeners was found when plotting older listeners' absolute score in the SS condition against DVoice
Benefit. Although the majority of older listeners showed

DVoice Benefit that neared or fell below the group average (25%), a small number of older listeners demonstrated DVoice Benefit that exceeds the group average.
Indeed, the data of these listeners were particularly
noteworthy, as they approximate the average DVoice Benefit of the younger listeners (depicted by asterisks).
There was also noted variability in the extent to
which minimizing the competing message's linguistic
meaningfulness improved identification accuracy. In
Figure 7 (middle panel), listeners' absolute score in the
SS condition is plotted against DMeaning Benefit. The
DMeaning Benefit ranged from 22 percentage points
(Listener G) to 66 percentage points (Listener I), with
the group average at 42 percentage points. Interestingly,
listeners who showed higher-than-average DVoice Benefit tended to show higher-than-average DMeaning Benefit (e.g., Listeners I and R). Among listeners who showed
lower-than-average DVoice Benefit, a more complex pattern emerged for DMeaning Benefit. Some listeners
persisted in showing lower-than-average benefit (e.g.,
Listeners G and K), whereas some showed improved
benefit (e.g., Listeners F and L).
With the exception of a few outliers (e.g., Listeners L
and H), there was far less variability among listeners in
the extent to which changing the type of target facilitated identification accuracy. In Figure 7 (bottom panel),
listeners' absolute score in the DS condition with a target
message is plotted against DTarget Type Benefit. The majority of listeners showed performance that approximated
the group average (43%).
A series of multiple regression models was used to
assess factors that might be predictive of the variable
benefit that individual older listeners received for each
of the experimental manipulations. The dependent measures were DVoice Benefit, DMeaning Benefit, and DTarget
Type Benefit, respectively. The inclusion of independent
variables within the models was similar to that outlined
in Table 3. The first three regression models used age
(Model 1), auditory sensitivity (Model 2), or the cognitive
measures (Model 3) as the predictor variables. Model 4
included both age and auditory sensitivity as the predictor variables, whereas the predictor variables in Model 5
included age and the cognitive measures. Model 6 included
all the predictor variables (age, auditory sensitivity, and the
cognitive measures), and Model 7 removed age as a predictor and included only auditory sensitivity and the cognitive measures.
Using age as the sole predictor variable (Model 1)
accounted for 73% of the adjusted variance in DVoice
Benefit among individual older listeners. When auditory
sensitivity was considered alone (Model 2), 20% of the
adjusted variance in individual listeners' scores was accounted for. Negligible variance was accounted for by the
cognitive predictors (Model 3). Including age in a model

with auditory sensitivity (Model 4) or in a model with the
cognitive measures (Model 5) accounted for a comparable
amount of the adjusted variance in DVoice Benefit (72% or
74%, respectively). Similarly, inclusion of all the predictor
variables (age, HF PTA, and cognitive measures) in Model 6
accounted for a total of 71% of the adjusted variance in listeners' scores. When age was removed (Model 7), the amount
of predictive variance accounted for dropped to 43%.
Less variance was accounted for when DMeaning
Benefit, rather than DVoice Benefit, was the dependent
variable. However, there were noted parallels in the relative contributions of the models. Age alone (Model 1)
accounted for 37% of the adjusted variance in DMeaning
Benefit among individual older listeners. Adding age
into a model with either auditory sensitivity (Model 4) or
the cognitive measures (Model 5) accounted for 39% of
the adjusted variance. When all the predictor variables
were included (Model 6), 33% of the adjusted variance in
listeners' scores was accounted for. The predicted variance dropped to 12% when age was removed (Model 7).
When DTarget Type Benefit was the dependent variable,
a negligible amount of predicted variance was realized
from the different models. At most, 10% of the adjusted
variance in older listeners' scores was accounted for
when age was the sole predictor variable (Model 1). Models 2-7 accounted for less than 10% of the adjusted variance in DTarget Type Benefit among older listeners.

Discussion
A primary aim of this study was to examine the
extent to which age deleteriously affects the perceptual
organization of speech and speech understanding in a
multitalker environment. Specifically, we quantified
older listeners' difficulty identifying a target signal as
a function of both the physical and linguistic properties
of the competing message and by altering what constitutes the target signal. Such a design was motivated by
the notion that both lower-level and higher-level processes contribute to the organization of competing speech
signals and, as a consequence, may be implicated in older
listeners' speech-understanding problems.

Usefulness of Vocal Distinctiveness:
Between and Within Age Groups
As a baseline, we compared the ability of younger and
older listeners to utilize cues related to vocal distinctiveness. This comparison verified that the benefit listeners
received from physical grouping cues in multitalker environments diminishes with age. Significant age-related
differences were found in overall identification accuracy
and in the extent to which performance improved when
increasing the vocal distinctiveness of the competing

talkers over three discrete levels. This finding is consistent with previous studies (Humes et al., 2006; Summers
& Leek, 1998; Vongpaisal & Pichora-Fuller, 2007).
Within the group of older listeners, age and DVoice
Benefit were negatively correlated. One reason for this
relationship may be that with advanced age comes an
increased difficulty extracting the physical features that
characterize vocal distinctiveness. Such an explanation
is consistent with studies that show age-related decline in
complex-tone pitch perception (Alain, McDonald, Ostroff,
& Schneider, 2001; Grube, von Cramon, & Rubsamen,
2003). In the present study, the peripheral encoding degradations that accompany advanced age may directly
limit the extent to which lower-level processes support
perceptual organization of the competing messages into
separate auditory objects.
However, one finding suggests that older listeners
could, at least temporarily, partition the competing messages into separate auditory objects. An analysis of the
older listeners' errors revealed a marked trend. The majority of errors (70%) corresponded to all or part of the
competing message. If the poorer performance of older
listeners is due solely to deficits in formulating auditory
objects on the basis of degraded physical grouping cues,
a distributed pattern of errors across all response alternatives would be expected. Instead, the distribution of
errors was skewed toward identification of the competing message and called into question whether signal
degradations were the limiting factor to correct identification. Others have used error analysis with the CRM
stimuli to reach similar conclusions with both young
(Brungart, 2001) and older adults (Humes et al., 2006).
Although the error analysis supports the idea that the
two competing messages are partitioned, the exact temporal location of this partitioning is unknown.
Because peripheral degradations do not appear to
be a complete explanation of older listeners' problems,
we also explored the extent to which their difficulties
persisted under different listening conditions. Using identification accuracy of a target message against a meaningful competitor as the baseline, changes in older listeners'
performance were calculated as a function of (a) minimizing the linguistic meaningfulness of the competing
message through time reversal and (b) shifting what constitutes the target signal from the message ("what") to the
talker ("who"). The motivation behind these manipulations was to consider the role that other factors, beyond peripheral degradations, have on age-related changes in
competing-speech perception.

Linguistic Meaningfulness of Competitor
Older listeners were predicted to have more difficulty when the competitor's message was linguistically

448

meaningful compared with when its linguistic meaningfulness was minimized. To the extent that a linguistically meaningful masker would produce both energetic
and informational masking (e.g., Li et al., 2004; Schneider
et al., 2007), removing its meaningfulness through time
reversal would lessen the total amount of masking (cf.
Rhebergen et al., 2005). Less informational masking occurs when the competing-speech signals are manipulated
in a manner that enhances their perceptual uniqueness
(e.g., Arbogast, Mason, & Kidd, 2005; Brungart, 2001).
The results support this prediction: Older listeners
showed a significant improvement in identification accuracy when the linguistic meaningfulness of the competing message was removed. Such a finding is in line
with other studies that explored the effect of a competing
message's meaningfulness on older listeners' speechunderstanding problems (Coughlin, 2004; Larsby et al.,
2005; Tun et al., 2002; Tun & Wingfield, 1999). Additionally, the large improvement in performance seen
when removing the linguistic meaningfulness of the competitor was consistently observed across all levels of vocal
distinctiveness. Whereas identification of a target message
improved by only 25 percentage points when enhancing
the competitor's vocal distinctiveness, older listeners received considerably more benefit (E40 percentage points)
from minimizing the competitor's linguistic meaningfulness. That older listeners realize greater benefit
when modifying the competing message on a mostly
linguistic level as opposed to an acoustic level supports
the idea that lower-level deficits are not the only factor
limiting correct identification of the target message. Instead, older listeners' difficulties in competing-speech
tasks appear to stem from an interplay between both
lower-level and higher-level processes.

Type of Target Signal
The accuracy with which listeners identified a target message was compared to the accuracy with which
they identified a target talker. Older listeners were predicted to have more difficulty identifying a target message ("what") than a target talker ("who") given the
greater amount of lexical access required for message
identification. The experimental findings align with this
prediction. Older listeners' identification of the target
talker was superior to identification of the target message when the competing signals were spoken by different talkers of the same sex. Importantly, the physical
stimuli were exactly the same in the target-message and
target-talker tasks. However, despite the fact that the
acoustics of the stimuli were the same and, hence, had
comparable representations in the periphery, identification accuracy improved by more than 40 percentage
points when listeners identified who was talking rather
than the content of the message being spoken.

Individual Variability
An additional aim of this study was to identify what
factors are most predictive of the individual variability in
identification accuracy among older listeners. The overall
accuracy with which individual listeners identified a competing message and the extent to which performance improved with signal manipulations differed considerably
among individual older listeners. If older listeners are
unable to perceptually organize the competing messages
into distinct auditory objects because of degraded physical grouping cues, the auditory measure alone would be
expected to account for a large portion of the predicted
variance. A strong relationship between peripheral variables and listeners' performance has been offered in support of the primary contribution of peripheral factors
(absolute sensitivity and psychoacoustic abilities) to agerelated changes in speech understanding (e.g., Divenyi &
Haupt, 1997a, 1997b; Dreschler & Plomp, 1980, 1985;
Humes, 2002; Humes & Christopherson, 1991; Humes &
Roberts, 1990; Humes et al., 1994; van Rooij & Plomp,
1990, 1992). However, we hypothesized that a contribution of both auditory and cognitive factors would account
for the largest portion of the variance, consistent with the
role of both lower-level and higher-level processes on perceptual organization of multitalker environments.
To assess this prediction, a series of multiple regression models were built using age, peripheral hearing status, and cognitive ability as predictor variables. Adjusted
R2 was compared across these models in an effort to identify which set(s) of predictor variables accounts for the
largest portion of the variance in overall identification
accuracy and relative benefit while controlling for differences in the models' complexity (i.e., number of predictors).
Such analysis is tempered by relationships among the
predictors (e.g., age and peripheral hearing status). Yet,
there is evidence that both auditory and cognitive factors
contribute to older listeners' overall performance: When
both auditory and cognitive variables are included in a regression model, age can be removed from the model without compromising its predictive power. This is not the case
when considering differences in individual benefit from
the specific experimental manipulations. Removing age as
a predictor of the benefit that older listeners receive from a
vocally distinct competitor deleteriously impacted the
model's predictive power. Age, peripheral hearing status, and cognitive abilities were less effective as predictors
when considering changes in identification accuracy from
manipulating the linguistic meaningfulness of the competitor or the nature of the target signal.

Interpretation in the Context
of Theoretical Models
The present study provides insight into age-related
changes in perceptual organization, which is conceived

as an intermediate process to recognition of a desired
message (e.g., Pichora-Fuller, 2003; Wingfield & Tun,
2007). Even though linguistic operations can be triggered
in the absence of signal detection (e.g., Carpenter, Miyake,
& Just, 1995), auditory objects may form the input to linguistic operations that underlie message comprehension.
Therefore, it is informative to interpret the current experimental results in the context of theoretical models of
age-related changes in spoken-language processing.
There is an extant body of work that supports an
"age-complexity effect" (Salthouse, 1991); basically, older
adults are at a greater disadvantage in more complex
tasks given that increases in task complexity are met by
increased demands on a finite, and potentially depleted,
store of processing resources (e.g., Cerella, 1990; Craik &
Byrd, 1982). In speech-in-noise tasks, older listeners' performance may be compromised because of reallocating a
limited store of processing resources to recover impoverished information at the auditory periphery (e.g., McCoy
et al., 2005; Murphy et al., 2000; Pichora-Fuller et al.,
1995; Schneider et al., 2000; Wingfield et al., 2006). For
example, Schneider et al. (2000) showed that when testing
both younger and older listeners under identical stimulus
conditions (same signal-to-noise ratio), older listeners are
under greater amounts of perceptual stress. Because of
this increase in stress, there is a reallocation of processing
resources from higher stages to lower stages in order to
recover the impoverished perceptual information. When
both the younger and older listeners in Schneider et al.'s
study were tested under conditions of equal perceptual
stress (variable signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to criterion performance), the negative effects of age on performance mostly disappeared (see also Murphy, Daneman,
& Schneider, 2006).
The present analysis focused on the factors that contribute to age-related decrements among older listeners.
Differences in design prevent direct comparison between
the current study and studies that compare performance
between young and older listeners. However, despite differences in approach, similar conclusions can be drawn.
Age-related changes in competing-speech perception are
appropriately framed in interactive terms rather than
modularizing deficits to a particular processing stage.
In the current study, identifying a target message in
the presence of a linguistically meaningful competitor is
conceived to be an operationally harder task than identifying a target message in the presence of a nonmeaningful competitor. Likewise, identifying what a talker
said is conceived to be an operationally harder task than
identifying who a talker is given the task's requisite level
of access. Indeed, older adults had greater difficulty identifying a target message over a target talker, and their
difficulty was exacerbated when the competing message
was linguistically meaningful.

Summary

ANSI. (2004). Specifications for audiometers (ANSI S3.6-2004).

The current study confirmed age-related decrements
in the effectiveness of certain physical grouping cues in
the perceptual organization and identification of competing messages. Specifically, the accuracy with which older
listeners identified a target message at increasing levels
of vocal distinctiveness was worse than that of younger
listeners. However, as a group, older listeners showed significant improvements in target-signal identification from
removing the meaningfulness of the competitor and altering the nature of the target signal from a message
("what") to a talker ("who"). Individual older listeners
differed considerably in the extent to which the experimental manipulations impacted target-signal identification. A combination of auditory and cognitive factors
accounted for the largest amount of variability in absolute identification scores among the older listeners. In
contrast, the age of individual listeners accounted for the
largest amount of variability in changes in identification
accuracy with a vocally distinct competitor. Taken together, these findings suggest that age-related declines
in multitalker environments are not solely due to lowerlevel deficits in perceptual organization but are also a
consequence of an interaction between lower-level and
higher-level processes.
