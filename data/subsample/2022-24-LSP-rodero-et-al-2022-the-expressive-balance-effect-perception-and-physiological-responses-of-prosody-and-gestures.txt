Abstract
The ability to deliver a speech effectively and persuade the audience is fundamental in
the professional landscape. Nonverbal features, such as voice and gestures, are crucial
to improving listeners' perception and information processing in a public presentation. In nonverbal communication research, most studies have mainly examined the
individual effects of these features and not their combined influence. Therefore,
this study analyzes the direct and interaction effects of intonation, speech rate, and
hand gestures on the speakers' credibility and effectiveness and the participants' psychophysiological response (attention and arousal). Results showed that the best combination was a moderate intonation at a medium speech rate with a moderate
number of hand gestures. These results supported the so-called Expressive Balance
Effect. Speakers must maintain the expressive load of the different nonverbal cues
in balance to be more effective and credible and enhance the listeners' cognitive processing. These findings are helpful recommendations for public speakers.

The ability to communicate effectively is a crucial aspect of social interaction. The relevance of acquiring oral communication and public speaking skills is critical in professional settings but also in social and personal spheres (van Ginkel et al., 2015). Most
communication and linguistic research have examined the influence of the content
(Guyer et al., 2019), but how a person says something is also relevant for cognitive
processing and social understanding. Literature shows that prosody and gesture features influence how an individual perceives and understands a message, which is
one way to assess its effectiveness (Beattie & Shovelton, 2005; Dargue et al., 2019;
King et al., 2020). Nonverbal cues can also affect the speakers' credibility (Jackob
et al., 2011; Rodero, 2015) and arouse listeners' emotions (Jackob et al., 2011;
Talley & Temple, 2015).
The problem here is that, on the one hand, most studies about the impact of nonverbal features have examined their individual effects (e.g., Maricchiolo et al., 2009).
However, research on the combined influence of different nonverbal cues is still
scarce (Jackob et al., 2011). Considering that different combined variations might
benefit the persuasive power of messages (Jackob et al., 2011), multivariable studies
are encouraged (Bavelas & Chovil, 2000; Guyer et al., 2019) and are needed to determine the optimal combination of nonverbal cues that optimizes listener's perception,
information processing, and emotional response. By analyzing how different
amounts and modalities of prosody cues and gestures interact, we could find the
optimal combination and whether the speaker should find an expressive balance
among the different features to improve the listeners' cognitive processing. We will
call this mechanism the Expressive Balance Effect.
On the other hand, Gordon and Druckman (2018) concluded that many of these
studies have theoretical research or an application-demonstration orientation, with
no empirical data to support the analysis. Moreover, few studies have employed psychophysiological methods to analyze how nonverbal cues, especially vocalics, are cognitively processed (Rodero, 2020; Rodero et al., 2017). Consequently, the main goal of
this study is to examine the individual and combined influence of intonation, speech
rate, and hand gestures on the speakers' credibility, effectiveness, physiological
arousal (measured with electrodermal activity (EDA)), and attention (measured with
heart rate).
We will combine self-report and physiological measures to identify the importance
of these different nonverbal cues. Self-report measures are not enough to study cognitive and emotional information processing, as the mental experience is a complex
process that requires the description of psychological states and the physiological reaction registered in response to the stimulus (Potter & Bolls, 2012). Bettiga et al. (2017)
has demonstrated that self-reported arousal measures are not sufficient to explain the
overall emotional response of individuals. To experience an emotional reaction, both
arousal and cognition are necessary (Singh & Churchill, 1987). This phenomenon is
called embodiment. Embodiment means that cognition involves the reaction of a
physical body. In other words, emotions are the cognitive recognition of the
body's reaction (Damasio, 2000; Schachter & Singer, 1962). Furthermore, arousal

Rodero et al.

661

plays a significant role in forming attitudes (Kim & Morris, 2007). All in all, we used
both self-report and physiological measures to obtain a complete description of the
psychological state experimented by participants, as many authors have suggested
(Caruelle et al., 2019).
The main contributions of this research will be threefold: (a) to show what is the
individual and combined influence of the different features; (b) to describe the
Expressive Balance Effect that takes place when different nonverbal cues act in combination, and (c) to demonstrate how these nonverbal features affect the individuals'
cognitive, emotional, and physiological response.

Influence of Prosody: Intonation and Speech Rate
Prosody is the set of nonverbal features composed of intonation, emphasis, and rhythm,
amongst others (Rodero, 2015). These features have an important role in language
since they influence the perception of a speaker (Varghese & Nilsen, 2020;
Weinstein et al., 2020) and cognitive processing (Rodero, 2020; Rodero et al.,
2017). The present study will focus on two prosody elements - intonation and
speech rate.
First, intonation is defined as a spoken sequence of pitch variations that can influence the listeners' response (Elbert & Dijkstra, 2014). Intonation can be emphatic (with
many variations), moderate (with medium tone variations), and monotonous (with few
variations). There are few studies about intonation in public speaking, even though it is
a significant variable in a speech since it shows the pitch progression throughout the
message. Research has shown that different intonation styles produce various perception effects, but findings are mixed. Some, like Jackob et al. (2011), found that a more
varied intonation facilitates source credibility but also dynamism (Addington, 1968),
while others found that tone variation does not affect the perception of credibility
(Chebat et al., 2007; Gelinas-Chebat et al., 1996). As for the effectiveness, there is
little agreement about the influence of intonation. Some studies found that this
feature does not affect the attitude towards the message (Gelinas-Chebat et al.,
1996) or its persuasion (Elbert & Dijkstra, 2014). In contrast, Jackob et al. (2011)
showed that significant changes in intonation increase speech persuasiveness.
Similarly, Rodero et al. (2017) demonstrated that a high-low pitch range enhances listeners' memory and attention. Overall, these findings indicate that the role of intonation
is still not clear. Therefore, we formulate the following research question:
RQ1: What is the intonation's effect on the speaker's perceived effectiveness (RQ1a) and
credibility (RQ1b) when delivering a speech?

Secondly, the speed at which the speaker delivers the message is another relevant
prosody factor for processing. Speech rate, which is typically measured in words per
minute (wpm), can be classified into slow (150-160 wpm), moderate (180 wpm),
and fast (200-220 wpm) (Rodero, 2020). Literature shows that variables such as persuasiveness, credibility, comprehension, and social influence vary according to speech

662

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 41(6)

rate (Buller & Aune, 1992; Jackob et al., 2011). However, empirical findings are still
inconsistent. Speakers with a moderate speech rate are perceived as more competent
and credible than slow or fast speakers (Guyer et al., 2019; Rodero, 2020). In contrast,
one study found that a fast speech rate, compared to a moderate or a slow one,
increased the perceptions of the source's credibility (Chebat et al., 2007). Fast speakers
could be more persuasive since they would be perceived as knowledgeable and expert
(Ostermeier, 1991). Conversely, slow speakers are perceived negatively, specifically as
less truthful, less fluent, less emphatic, less animated, and less extroverted (Addington,
1968; Apple et al., 1979). However, the findings are inconsistent. Some studies have
shown that fast speed facilitates persuasiveness (Apple et al., 1979; Jackob et al.,
2011), whereas others concluded that persuasiveness is higher for a slower speech
(Yokoyama & Daibo, 2012). Finally, a meta-analysis of 18 studies found a curvilinear
relationship between the speech rate and persuasiveness, with the moderate speech rate
(181 wpm) being associated with greater persuasion (Kim et al., 2019). 180 wpm also
was the optimal speech rate in two different studies one of them using psychophysiological measures (Rodero, 2016, 2020). The results showed that speech rate affected
the listener's recall and recognition of information, with moderate speech
(180 wpm) being the best processed and confirming the so-called Moderate
Dynamic Mechanism (Rodero, 2016). Speech rate must be fast enough to attract the
listener's attention but moderate not to hinder comprehension. A significant limitation
of most of the studies reviewed is that they frequently compare only two delivery rates
at a time, and they do not consider the whole spectrum of delivery rates (Kim et al.,
2019). Therefore, more research comparing the effects of different delivery rates is
advisable. That said, previous findings suggest that the ideal speech rate would be
the moderate one. Thus, our first hypothesis is:
H1: A moderate speech rate, in comparison to a slow or a fast one, will lead to higher
levels of the speaker's perceived effectiveness (H1a) and credibility (H1b).

Influence of Hand Gestures
Along with prosody, literature has also shown the relevance of other nonverbal communication cues, such as gestures and facial expressions, on comprehension (Dargue
et al., 2019) but also on the evaluation and perception of the message and the
speaker (King et al., 2020). In this study, we will focus on hand gestures.
Hand gestures refer to the arm and hand movements accompanying speech (Wagner
et al., 2014). According to research, they benefit comprehension (Dargue et al., 2019)
and support memory (Clough & Duff, 2020). Apart from these facilitative outcomes,
hand gestures also influence the perception of the speaker's abilities and traits, such as
warmth and dominance (Gnisci & Pace, 2014), honesty (King et al., 2020), credibility
(Maricchiolo et al., 2009), and persuasiveness (Jackob et al., 2011; Maricchiolo et al.,
2009). They also enable immediacy between speaker and listeners (Talley & Temple,
2015) and stimulate emotional reactions (Jackob et al., 2011). Likewise, gestures

Rodero et al.

663

influence the recipient's perception of the message by making it more persuasive
(Jackob et al., 2011; Peters & Hoetjes, 2017) and effective (Beattie & Shovelton,
2005).
Literature has mainly analyzed the diverse influence of different types of gestures by
maintaining the gesture amount equal (e.g., Maricchiolo et al., 2009; Talley and
Temple, 2015), which allowed researchers to find that the absence of gestures had a
negative effect on the evaluation of the message (Peters & Hoetjes, 2017). This
raises the question of whether the rate of hand gestures is also relevant and not just
the presence of these cues. A different amount of gestures could have a different
effect on the perception and processing of the message. Previous experiments have
shown that speakers are considered warmer and more dominant if they produce a
high gesture rate (Gnisci & Pace, 2014). However, only a few studies have manipulated
the frequency of hand gestures, and they have focused on speakers' attributions other
than credibility. Therefore, we argue that more research is needed, and we formulate
the following research question:
RQ2: What is the effect of the number of gestures on the speaker's perceived effectiveness
(RQ2a) and credibility (RQ2b)?

The Expressive Balance Effect in Processing Nonverbal Cues
One of the main criticisms of studies about nonverbal cues' effect is their common
single cue approach (Bull, 1986; Burgoon et al., 1990; Clough & Duff, 2020; De
Waele et al., 2019). Most experimental research analyzes the separate effects of one
single cue rather than investigating the combined effects (Jackob et al., 2011; Loehr,
2012; Yokoyama & Daibo, 2012).
There are few studies combining different non-verbal cues. De Waele et al. (2019)
analyzed the interplay between verbal and vocal features (voice pitch and speech rate)
and concluded that the impact of combined vocal cues differs from the sum of separate
effects. Guyer et al. (2019) examined the combined effects of intonation and speech
rate. Their results showed that the simultaneous combination of different levels of
these features had an additive effect on perceptions of the speaker and recipient attitudes towards the message. Rodero (2015) found an interaction effect between intonation/stress and speech rate. Jackob et al. (2011) combined voice and gestures and
showed that vocal emphasis and gestures were perceived as more vivid, powerful, selfassured, and livelier. Therefore, research of isolated cues might have underestimated
their combined effects. For these reasons, in this study, we will also analyze the interaction among different non-verbal features.
We can infer from previous studies that a high expressivity versus apathy or monotony is perceived as more positive. Individually, a more dynamic intonation, faster
speech rate, and a larger number of hand gestures could attract more attention and
improve perception and processing (Gnisci & Pace, 2014; Guyer et al., 2019;
Jackob et al., 2011; Rodero, 2020; Rodero et al., 2017). However, we do not know

664

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 41(6)

whether a combination of more than one high expressive cue could be detrimental to
enhancing cognitive processing. Following the compensation hypothesis, different
nonverbal cues might coordinate with one another to find an expressive balance.
The compensation hypothesis was firstly applied to nonverbal communication by
Patterson (1973) in the context of immediacy. Patterson stated that when a comfortable
level of intimacy is reached, any change in one of the nonverbal behaviors, such as eye
contact, requires a reciprocal change in one or more of the other behaviors to maintain
equilibrium. More recent literature has suggested that speakers compensate verbal
activity and gestures to achieve influence so that if there is reduced verbal activity,
more gestural behavior is required (Maricchiolo et al., 2009). Therefore, an abundance
of hand gestures combined with emphatic intonation and a fast speech rate might cause
an excessive expressivity load. With all nonverbal cues at a high expressive level, the
speaker might be perceived as overwhelmed or exaggerated, and an overload of information could occur. Therefore, we will test what we call the Expressive Balance Effect
to analyze if the different features combine and readjust to find an equilibrium or
expressive balance. Based on the above, we pose the following research questions:
RQ3: What is the most effective and credible combination between intonation, speech
rate, and gestures?

Finally, a common limitation of existing research is the use of self-report scales and
the lack of consistency due to different measures (Burgoon et al., 1990). Most of the
studies that were discussed above about the influence of prosody (e.g., Guyer et al.,
2019; Rodero, 2015; Varghese and Nilsen, 2020; Yokoyama and Daibo, 2012) and
other nonverbal behavior (e.g., Dargue et al., 2019; Gnisci and Pace, 2014; Talley
and Temple, 2015) used self-report measures and a theoretical-research or an
application-demonstration orientation (Gordon & Druckman, 2018). In contrast, physiological measures have been pointed out as a promising approach with some advantages. The first one is a real-time measurement simultaneously that individuals are
exposed to the nonverbal stimuli. But the second one is the possibility to register the
subjects' unconscious or implicit response. Self-report measures describe conscious
psychological states while physiological techniques can register unconscious
responses, which is very important when analyzing nonverbal cues. When an emotional reaction is elicited, this response may or not be perceived consciously and
vice versa. Moreover, many nonverbal cues are unconsciously processed. In the
study by Ohme et al. (2009), participants found no conscious differences between
the two ads, but the commercial with a hand gesture elicits higher arousal measured
with EDA. Therefore, this measure can be a reliable procedure to explore their
effect. However, few studies on the effects of nonverbal communication have used
physiological data. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, some of these
studies (Kelly et al., 2004; Wu & Coulson, 2007) found that gestures increase language
comprehension. Consequently, we combine self-report measures with psychophysiological measures in the current study. We now formulate the last research questions

Rodero et al.

665

related to the different prosody features and the relationship between self-report measures and physiological results.
RQ5: What is the intonation style that attracts more attention and emotional activation?
RQ6: What is the quantity of gestures that attracts more attention and emotional
activation?
RQ7: What is the combination of intonation and gestures that attracts more attention and
emotional activation?
RQ8: Is there any relation between the participants' self-report and physiological
response?

Method
Design
The design was a 3 intonation (monotonous-moderate-emphatic) by 3 speech rates
(slow-moderate-fast) by 3 gestures (few-moderate-many) x 2 (scripts) within-subjects
experiment applied to effectiveness and credibility. The statistical analyses of physiological data (arousal and attention) were submitted to a 3 (intonation styles) by 24-s
(length of the speeches), 3 (speech rates) by 24-s, and a 3 (gestures) by 24-s repeated
measures ANOVA. Four professional actors (two male and two female) were trained to
perform two speeches in front of a camera. The intonation styles, speech rates, gestures, and actors were within-subjects factors. Speeches were between-subjects factors.

Stimuli
For the experiment, 216 videos were recorded, 108 on each speech, 27 by each of the
four speakers.
First, we wrote four different speeches with popular content among young university students, as they were the sample. We looked for non-emotional information. The
scripts were written following the rules of oral language, simple complexity and prepared for a brief public presentation as an elevator pitch. They maintained the same
structure and number of words. Secondly, we conducted a pretest for choosing two
of them. We wanted to analyze different messages to reduce the effects of the
content. A sample of 60 students ranked all the scripts in 7-point scales: (a) their interest in the topic, (b) the understanding level, and (c) the neutrality vs. emotion they felt
when reading them. The Tattooing text (M = 5.68, SD = 1.40), followed by the
Amazonas (M = 5.28, SD = .93), attained the highest total scores in the three variables
and were selected for the final experiment. Each actor recorded 54 videos--27 with the
Tattooing text and 27 with the Amazon text.

666

Each video lasted an average of 24 s, which is the average duration of an elevator
pitch. The discourses needed to be short for three reasons: (1) participants had to watch
many videos, (2) we needed to control all the variables, and (3) due to the extensive
data generated in physiological responses. Nonetheless, the length of the discourses
was not a problem for the experiment, as all of them had the entire structure and
sense (introduction, development, and conclusion) and were pretested successfully
for understanding.
Each speech was recorded by each speaker representing the combination of the different nonverbal features with a different expressive load level (- = + ): three intonation styles (monotonous -, moderate = , emphatic + ), three speech rates (slow -,
moderate = , fast + ), and three quantity of gestures (few -, moderate = , many + ).
These conditions (3 x 3 x 3) mean 108 videos in total, 27 videos by each speaker.
Regarding the intonation variable, vocal cues were measured by acoustic analysis
software Praat to keep constant values across speakers when expressing each intonation style (monotonous, moderate, emphatic). Intonation was calculated by obtaining
the speaker's pitch range (maximum pitch minus minimum pitch). An ANOVA was
performed to test if pitch range was similar among speakers on every condition. The
data showed no significant differences across actors when making comparisons
within the same condition. Table 1 shows the data.
The speech rate variable was measured by calculating the number of words per
minute (w/m). ANOVA showed no significant differences in any of the speech rate
conditions.
The number of gestures on each condition was controlled with Codimg's performance analysis software. This video analysis software classifies and quantifies gestures. The gestures were illustrators defined as speech-related gestures (Ekman &
Friesen, 2010). As is shown in Table 1, there were no significant differences in the
gesture conditions either.
The shooting set was a TV studio with a teleprompter to read the speeches, optimal
acoustic conditions, equal lighting conditions, and plain dark blue background. All the
actors used the same professional lavalier microphone. Therefore, loudness was normalized and maintained constant in all the recordings.

Participants
Once the stimulus was created, a sample formed by 120 university students (79 females
and 41 males) aged between 20 and 30 years (M = 21, SD = 1.08) participated in the
study. We recruited 120 participants, a considerable number in psychophysiological
studies (Potter & Bolls, 2012). Participants were randomly selected from some communication courses. They were divided into two groups. Sixty watched the
Tattooing videos and 60 the Amazonas videos. Therefore, all the participants were
exposed to all the experimental conditions except speech.

Dependent Variables
Effectiveness scale. For measuring effectiveness, we used the Rodero et al., scale
(2013), validated to rate voice perception. The effectiveness index measured how
clear, natural, pleasant, understandable, and persuasive the speaker was perceived.
All four dimensions were measured on a 5-points scale, with 1 representing the
minimum value and five the maximum. The scale had a high Cronbach Alpha coefficient ( = .93).
Credibility scale. Credibility refers to the characteristic of being trustworthy. This
study analyzed three dimensions: competence, trustworthiness, and goodwill of the
speaker applying the McCroskey and Teven credibility scale (1999). Competence
refers to having experience, knowledge, and leadership abilities; trustworthiness
means character, and goodwill refers to the intention toward the listener of the
message. All three dimensions were measured on a 5-point scale with larger
numbers representing a higher credibility level ( = .94).
Psychophysiological measures. Physiological arousal and attention were collected, time-locked to the stimuli presentation. EDA measures the sympathetic
nervous system's activity to index motivational response and an increase in emotional activation or arousal. Arousal is the state of being activated and physiologically alert, awake, and attentive. Therefore, an increase in EDA can also
indicate more attention to the stimulus. The electrodermal activity was quantified
by measuring the conductance of a constant voltage (.5 V) delivered to two
8 mm AG/AGCL electrodes placed on the participants' fingers of the non-dominant
hand. A Biopac bioamplifier MP-160 generated EDA values. For each participant,
the signal was calibrated before the experimental session and was recorded with a
sampling rate of 1,000 Hz and Low pass filters (LP: 66.5 Hz, Q = 0.5 and LP:
38.5 Hz, Q = 1). The registers were taken each half a second, with 48 registers
in total by each video.
Attention was measured using an electrocardiogram (EKG), from which we
extracted heart rate using the R-wave peaks. Three Beckman standard 8 mm
Ag-AgCl electrodes were placed on the participants' chest with a ground electrode.
ECG was recorded with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz a band-pass filter of 0.5-35 Hz.
Milliseconds between the QRS-complex in the electrocardiogram were converted
into heart rate and used as a physiological measure of attention, with lower beats per
minute (BPM) rates indicatives of greater levels (Potter & Bolls, 2012). The registers
were taken each half a second, with 48 registers in total by each video. Changes in heart
rate index the cognitive resources allocated to processing information; thus, it can
measure attention to different messages (Potter & Bolls, 2012). The heart rate deceleration predisposes individuals to be more receptive to external information by increasing the cognitive resources allocated to encoding information.
Therefore, cardiac activity was used in this study as a physiological measure of cognitive processing, while EDA is a physiological measure of emotional processing.
Arousal and attention are interlinked (Potter & Bolls, 2012). If the stimulus is effective
and credible, individuals should pay more attention to the stimulus allocating more

Rodero et al.

669

cognitive resources and feeling more aroused and motivated with higher activation of
the sympathetic nervous system (Bell et al., 2018; Bettiga et al., 2020).

Convergent Validity: Arousal and Valence Self-Report Measures
To control the perceived emotional response across the different videos (Caruelle et al.,
2019), we applied the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale to measure arousal and
valence, the two dimensions that define emotions (Bradley & Lang, 1994). Self-report
arousal was operationalized as the intensity of the emotion and was measured on a
5-point scale. Self-report valence was measured on two 5-point scales: positive and
negative emotion. The valence scale was computed by subtracting the positivity
score from the negativity score for a given subject and message.

After providing informed consent, the physiological sensors were attached to the participants' bodies, fingers for EDA, and chest for ECG. After attaching the electrodes,
participants were placed in a comfortable chair. Each participant watched the videos
using professional studio headphones. The order was random. Immediately after
each message, the participant completed the effectiveness and credibility scales.
This exact procedure was repeated with all the videos. The sensors were then
removed. The experiment was conducted in two different sessions with the same
number of videos. Each lasted 40 min. Participants received two credits for their
participation.

Results
Convergent Validity: Arousal and Valence Self-Report Measures
A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to examine the effect
of arousal and valence on effectiveness and credibility. Arousal had a significant main
effect on effectiveness F (1, 119) = 493.91, p < .001, partial 2 = .125, and credibility,
F (1, 119) = 565.11, p < .001, partial 2 = .140. Also, there were significant effects for
valence in effectiveness, F (1, 119) = 109.88, p < .001, partial 2 = .067, and credibility, F (1, 119) = 187.99, p < .001, partial 2 = .109. Also, the interaction between
arousal and valence was significant, F (1, 119) = 15.83, p < .001, partial 2 = .030; F
(1, 119) = 11.43, p < .001, partial 2 = .022.
Along with this, there were also positive correlations among all the self-report variables: effectiveness and arousal (r = .851, p < .001); effectiveness and valence (r =
.757, p < .001); credibility and arousal (r = .869, p < .001); and credibility and
valence (r = .810, p < .001). The more effective and credible participants perceived
the message, the more they considered it positive and arousing.

Intonation, Speech Rate, and Gestures Self-Report
To test RQ1, H1, RQ2 and RQ3, a 3 (intonation styles) by 3 (speech rates) by 3 (gestures) by 2 (scripts) factorial MANOVA was performed on the two dependent variables: effectiveness and credibility. There were no significant differences by script in
effectiveness, F (2, 118) = 2.23, p = .1835, partial 2 = .000, or credibility, F (2,
118) = 3.86, p = .049, partial 2 = .000.
About the effectiveness variable, the combined dependent variables resulted in significant main effects for intonation, F (2, 118) = 1149.36, p < .001, partial 2 = .142,
speech rate, F (2, 118) = 729.74, p < .001, partial 2 = .095, and gestures, F (2, 118)
= 12.62, p < .001, partial 2 = .002. The moderate style was the most effective regarding intonation, followed by emphatic and monotonous. The post-hoc tests showed significant differences among all the intonation types. The moderate rate obtained the
highest value in the speech rate, followed by fast and slow. The post-hoc tests
showed significant differences among all the speech rate types. Also, the moderate
quantity was the most effective for gestures, followed by many and few gestures.
The post-hoc tests showed significant differences among moderate and many with
few gestures.
The results also were significant for all the interactions: intonation by speech rate, F
(2, 118) = 100.43, p < .001, partial 2 = .028, intonation by gestures, F (2, 118) =
10.38, p < .001, partial 2 = .003, and speech rate by gestures, F (2, 118) = 3.54, p =
.007, partial 2 = .001.Concerning the two-way interaction of intonation by speech
rate, the highest level was for the combination of moderate intonation-moderate
speech rate followed by the emphatic intonation-moderate speech rate, moderate
intonation-fast pace, emphatic intonation-fast speech rate, emphatic intonation-slow
speech rate, moderate intonation-slow speech rate, monotonous intonation-moderate
speech rate, monotonous intonation-fast speech rate, and monotonous intonation-slow
speech rate. The most effective interaction between intonation and gestures was moderate intonation-moderate gestures, followed by moderate intonation-many gestures,
moderate intonation-few gestures, emphatic intonation-moderate gestures, emphatic
intonation-few gestures, emphatic intonation-many gestures, monotonous intonationmany gestures, monotonous intonation-moderate gestures, and monotonous
intonation-few gestures. About speech rate and gestures, the most effective interaction
was moderate speech rate and gestures, followed by moderate speech rate-many gestures, moderate speech rate-few gestures, fast speech rate-many gestures, fast speech
rate-moderate gestures, fast speech rate-few gestures, slow speech rate-few gestures,
slow speech rate-moderate gestures, and slow speech rate-many gestures, as shown
in Table 2.
Finally, the interaction between intonation, speech rate, and gestures resulted in significant main effects, F (2, 118) = 11.89, p < .001, partial 2 = .007.
About the credibility variable, the dependent variables resulted in significant main
effects for intonation, F (2, 118) = 1466.95, p < .001, partial 2 = .174, speech rate, F
(2, 118) = 576.88, p < .001, partial 2 = .077, and gestures, F (2, 118) = 10.49,
p < .001, partial 2 = .002. The moderate style was the most credible regarding

intonation, followed by emphatic and monotonous. The post-hoc tests showed significant differences among all the intonation types. The moderate obtained the highest
credibility regarding speech rate, followed by fast and slow. The post-hoc tests
showed significant differences among all the speech rate types. Concerning gestures,
the moderate quantity was the most effective, followed by many gestures and few gestures (see Table 2). The post-hoc tests showed significant differences among moderate
and many with few gestures.
In credibility, the results also were significant for all the interactions: intonation by
speech rate, F (2, 118) = 122.97, p < .001, partial 2 = .034; intonation by gestures, F
(2, 118) = 12.44, p < .001, partial 2 = .004, and speech rate by gestures, F (2, 118) =
6.63, p < .001, partial 2 = .002. Concerning the two-way interaction of intonation by
speech rate, the highest level was for the combination of moderate intonation-moderate
speech rate, followed by the emphatic intonation-moderate speech rate, the emphatic
intonation-fast pace, the moderate intonation-fast speech rate, the emphatic intonationslow speech rate, moderate intonation-slow speech rate, monotonous intonationmoderate speech rate, monotonous intonation-fast speech rate, and monotonous
intonation-slow speech rate. The most credible interaction between intonation and gestures was moderate, then moderate intonation-many gestures, emphatic intonationmoderate gestures, emphatic intonation-few gestures, moderate intonation-few gestures, emphatic intonation-many gestures, monotonous intonation-many gestures,
monotonous intonation-moderate, and monotonous intonation-few gestures.
Regarding the interaction between speech rate and gestures, the most credible was
moderate speech rate-many gestures, moderate in both cases, moderate speech
rate-few gestures, fast speech rate-many gestures, fast speech rate-moderate gestures,
fast-speech rate-few gestures, slow speech rate-few gestures, slow speech ratemoderate gestures, and slow speech rate-many gestures.
The interaction between intonation, speech rate, and gestures resulted in significant
main effects, F (2, 118) = 10.42, p < .001, partial 2 = .006. The final order of the

Rodero et al.

673

interaction was similar for effectiveness and credibility, especially in intonation and
speech rate and intonation and gestures (see Table 2).
These results answer RQ1: A moderate intonation led to higher speaker effectiveness and credibility. Similarly, H1 was confirmed since the moderate speech rate led
to higher speaker effectiveness (H1a) and credibility (H1b). For RQ2, a moderate quantity of gestures led to higher speaker effectiveness and credibility. For RQ3, the most
effective and credible interaction was moderate intonation, speech rate, and gestures.
Finally, relations between variables were analyzed using Pearson Correlation analysis. All correlations were significant at p < .001. There was a strong correlation
between effectiveness and credibility (r = .903), as well as between these variables
and the independent ones. For effectiveness: Intonation (r = .262), Speech Rate (r =
.068), and Gestures (r = .034). For credibility: Intonation (r = .324), Speech Rate (r
= .115), and Gestures (r = .034). The most influencer variable was intonation, followed
by speech rate, and gestures.
Physiological measures. Regarding intonation, the psychophysiological data were analyzed by applying 3 (intonation) x 24 (time) repeated-measures ANOVA for the
arousal and attention dependent variables. For physiological arousal, the results were
significant for the interaction intonation by time, F (2,118) = 1.52, p = .014, partial
2 = .027. The emphatic style achieved the highest arousal (M = .40; SD = .06), followed by moderate (M = .37; SD = .05), and monotonous (M = .32; SD = .04).
For attention, the results were significant for the interaction between time and intonation, F (2,118) = 2.24, p < .001, partial 2 = .024. The emphatic style achieved the
lowest level (M = .94; SD = .23), followed by moderate (M = 1.19; SD = .25), and
monotonous (M = 1.40; SD = .23). Figure 1 shows the results for EDA and heart rate.
These results answer RQ4: the intonation style that caught more attention and emotional activation were two, in this case, the emphatic and the moderate in this order,
with no significant results among them.
About speech rate, the design was 3 (speech rate) x 24 (time) repeated-measures
ANOVA for the same variables. There were significant results for arousal in the interaction with time, F (2,118) = 3.95, = .050, partial 2 = .049. The fast speech rate
achieved the highest level (M = .42; SD = .67), followed by moderate (M = .39; SD
= .70), and slow pace (M = .38; SD = .53). For attention, there were no significant

results, F (2,118) = 2.16, = .145, partial 2 = .025. Figure 2 shows the results for this
variable.
These data answer RQ5: the speech rate with the highest emotional activation level
was the fast pace.
Concerning gestures, the data were analyzed using a 3 (gestures) x 24 (time)
repeated-measures ANOVA. In arousal, the results were significant for gesture by
time, F (2,118) = 2.49, <.001, partial 2 = .037. The model with many gestures
achieved the highest arousal (M = .39; SD = .05), followed by moderate (M = .36;
SD = .05), and few gestures (M = .34; SD = .05).
HR analysis for gestures had significant results for the interaction between time and
gesture, F (2,118) = 1.53, p = .012, partial 2 = .036. The many gestures model
achieved the lowest level (M = .99; SD = .23), followed by moderate (M = 1.13; SD
= .24), and monotonous (M = 1.23; SD = .26). Figure 3 shows the results for EDA
and heart rate.
These results answer RQ6: the number of gestures that grabbed more attention and
emotional activation also was two, many and moderate in this order, with no significant
results among them.
Finally, we only analyzed the interaction intonation-gestures in the psychophysiological analysis due to the high number of combinations. There were significant results
in intonation by gesture for physiological arousal, F (2,118) = 1.30, p = .029, but not
for heart rate, F (2,118) = .791, p = .930. The best combination was moderate
intonation-many gestures (M = .49; SD = .06), followed by emphatic intonation-many
gestures (M = .43; SD = .06), emphatic intonation-few gestures (M = .41; SD = .06),
moderate intonation-moderate gestures (M = .37; SD = .06), monotonous intonationmoderate gestures (M = .35; SD = .06), emphatic intonation-moderate gestures (M =
.34; SD = .06), moderate intonation-few gestures (M = .34; SD = .06),monotonous

intonation-few gestures (M = .29; SD = .06), and monotonous intonation-many gestures (M = .28; SD = .06).
These data answer RQ7. The combination of intonation and gestures that attracted
more emotional activation was moderate intonation with many gestures. There were no
significant results in the heart rate (attention) interaction.
To answer RQ8, we first compared the physiological data with the perception of
effectiveness and credibility. There were positive correlations among all the variables: HR and effectiveness (r = .042, p < .001); EDA and effectiveness (r = .056,
p < .001); HR and credibility (r = .047, p < .001), and EDA and credibility (r =
.060, p < .001). HR and EDA also had a significant correlation (r = .033, p < .001).
It is important to note that these significant correlations are small, as physiological
data are processed second-by-second during message exposure while self-report
results show average ratings. They are different measures. As Potter and Bolls
(2012) remark, the temporal dynamics must be considered, as they can produce
modest correlations. In any case, the significant correlations showed that the higher
attention and body activation or arousal, the more effective and credible the
message was perceived by participants.
Along with correlations, multiple regression analyses were conducted to test
whether arousal (EDA), attention (HR), self-report arousal, and self-report valence
were predictors of effectiveness and credibility. First, regarding effectiveness, results
indicated that predictors explained 77% of the variance, F (4, 6,955) = 5840.97,
p < .001. Effectiveness was significantly predicted by EDA ( = -.014, p = .021), selfreport arousal ( = .681, p < .001) and self-report valence ( = .241, p < .001), but not
by HR ( = -.009, p = .158). Secondly, for credibility, results showed that predictors
explained 81% of the variance, F (4, 6,955) = 7377.75, p < .001. Credibility was significantly predicted by EDA ( = -.019, p < .001), self-report arousal ( = .628,
p < .001) and self-report valence ( = .326, p < .001), but not by HR ( = -.003, p =
.618). Therefore, both arousal and valence predicted judged effectiveness and credibility. Moreover, in both models, the high values of explained variance showed a strong
association among arousal (EDA measurement and self-report), self-report valence,
and the dependent variables. Heart rate was not found as a predictor of these variables,
which can be considered logical, as HR does not measure the emotional processing
(valence or arousal) but the cognitive processing (effort or attention).

676

The interaction effect between arousal (EDA measurement) and self-report arousal
on effectiveness and credibility was significant ( = .087, p < .001). With the interaction effect added, the predictors still explained 77% of the variance, F (5, 6,956) =
4688.17, p < .001. On the contrary, the interaction between EDA and self-report
arousal on credibility was not significant ( = -.010, p = .579).
Finally, the interaction effect between HR and self-report arousal on effectiveness
was significant ( = -.185, p < .001). With the interaction effect added, the predictors
still explained 77% of the variance, F (5, 6,954) = 4682.09, p < .001. On the contrary,
the interaction between HR and self-report arousal on credibility was not significant (
= -.053, p = .288). In conclusion, there were significant main effects on effectiveness
and credibility but no evidence of a relevant interaction among variables.
We calculated each nonverbal combination's expressivity load to compare the
results and weighted them depending on the variables' final order. The result is
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4 exhibits the expressivity level with a clear descent line from high to low.
Therefore, the combination styles that achieved the highest effectiveness, credibility,
attention, and arousal levels were those with a high expressivity load. In contrast,
the low expressivity level was in the last positions. In line with the results obtained
by the different elements individually, participants preferred moderate-high expressive
styles.
The results also show the crucial role of intonation. Intonation drew a clear trend,
divided into three segments. The first segment is the most effective, credible, appealing, and arousal styles that are moderate, followed by an intermediate area of emphaticmoderate and a third segment, in the end, with all the monotonous styles. In the first
segment (three first positions in Figure 4), only gestures increase the expressivity
level to many when the intonation style and speech rate are moderate. When intonation

is emphatic, as it is the feature with more weight, then the rest of the elements do not
need a high expressivity. In this case, the speech rate maintains moderate, and gestures
drop to moderate or low (positions 3 to 6). If intonation is emphatic and speech rate is
fast, both with high load, then gestures have to decrease the expressivity level (positions 6 to 8). If intonation is moderate, but the speech rate is fast (or vice versa), gestures make compensation and drop to moderate or low (positions 8 to 11). Therefore,
this first segment represents combinations of high expressivity achieved through a
compensation mechanism, a balance among the different nonverbal cues, in which
speech rate and gestures are distributed depending on the intonation expressivity load.
In the intermediate segment (from 11 to 18 positions), we can see an emphatic intonation area but with less expressivity than the first segment (descendent line), as this
high load in intonation is compensated by a fall in the other elements. When intonation
is emphatic, only one of the other features can be high. If the speech rate is moderate,
then gestures are many. If the speech rate is fast, then gestures are few and vice versa.
In the last part of this segment, there is an area with less expressivity in which intonation is at a moderate level with a slow speech rate and gestures modulating the
relationship.
Finally, in the last segment (positions 19 to 27), as intonation is always monotonous, then speech rate or gestures or both are moderate-high, except in the last positions in which the expressivity is very low. The worst perception in the last position
is for the lowest expressivity load.

Discussion
The goal of this research was to examine the individual and combined influence of different nonverbal cues (intonation, speech rate, and hand gestures) on the speakers'
credibility, effectiveness, physiological arousal (measured with EDA), and attention
(measured with heart rate).
Analyzed individually, the results showed that a moderate expressivity load
increased the effectiveness and credibility levels while a high load aroused the most
significant participants' emotional activation and grabbed the most attention compared
in both cases to a low level of expressivity.
First, the most effective and credible intonation was moderate, followed by
emphatic and monotonous, while the highest level of arousal and attention was for
the emphatic style, then moderate and monotonous intonation. Therefore, participants
perceived that the moderate intonation was the most effective and credible, although
their body response was more intense with the emphatic. This result seems logical
since a more active and dynamic style with constant tone variations should elicit
higher arousal and attention levels. As shown in some studies about intonation
(Rodero et al., 2017), tone changes, by introducing a novel signal acoustically, can
act as orienting elements catching the listeners' attention and causing a more robust
activation. The physiological results in this study suggest that this is what occurred.
Therefore, according to previous studies, these findings have shown that tone variations facilitate source credibility and persuasiveness (Jackob et al., 2011), as they

678

Journal of Language and Social Psychology 41(6)

are perceived as more dynamic (Addington, 1968). The results for the monotonous
intonation were the worst rated, however. This style was perceived as less effective
and credible, with less attention and autonomic arousal. The absence of pitch variations
reduced the participants' activation and attention, and the perception was the most negative in terms of effectiveness and credibility. Therefore, on the whole, the optimal perception and processing was a style between moderate and emphatic.
Secondly, the speech rate's results were consistent and showed that the moderate
pace was the most effective and credible, followed by fast and slow. Again, individually and in self-report, the optimal level of expressivity was moderate, around
180 wpm, as in previous studies that have shown that this rate improves persuasion
(Kim et al., 2019), attention and memory (Rodero, 2016, 2020), and that speakers
are perceived as more competent and credible as opposed to slow or fast speakers
(Guyer et al., 2019; Rodero, 2015). The moderate speech rate, at 180 wpm, was the
most positively perceived, as it was slow enough to follow the information effectively
but dynamic enough to consider the speaker as credible, according to the Moderate
Dynamic Mechanism (Rodero, 2016). However, the fast speech rate attained the
highest physiological activation, although there were no significant results in heart
rate. As with intonation, it seems reasonable to think that a more dynamic pace can
produce higher arousal. This result is in line with studies showing that fast speakers
can be perceived as more credible and persuasive (Chebat et al., 2007; Jackob et al.,
2011; Ostermeier, 1991). By contrast, a paused style is less dynamic and sounds
more monotonous; thus, it elicits less body activation. For this reason, the slow pace
was the rate perceived as the less effective and credible in this study, according to previous research (Addington, 1968; Apple et al., 1979; Rodero, 2016, 2020). Therefore,
the results showed that the optimal expressivity level was moderate-fast.
Third, regarding the influence of gestures, the results showed that this feature significantly contributed to the perception of effectiveness and credibility. Moreover,
the number of hand gestures influenced the participants' physiological response. The
most effective and credible style was using a moderate quantity of gestures. As hand
gestures illustrate the message, reinforcing the meaning of the words, a moderate
use was perceived as more effective and credible, in line with other studies showing
that hand gestures stimulate emotional reactions and enhance comprehension
(Dargue et al., 2019). Therefore, once again, in self-report, a moderate expressivity
level was preferred for perceiving effectiveness and credibility. However, as in intonation and speech rate, the physiological response showed that the style arousing the
strongest emotional activation and catching the greatest attention was many hand gestures. The explanation can be the same as before. In this case, the most dynamic and
active style, with many hand movements, is this that attracted more attention and elicited more activation. Previous experiments have shown that speakers are considered
warmer and more dominant if they produce a high gesture rate (Gnisci & Pace,
2014). Therefore, a more changing stimulus with more movement was the most arousing. According to previous studies (Maricchiolo et al., 2009; Peters & Hoetjes, 2017),
fewer gestures had a negative effect. As this model was the most static and less expressive, logically, it was perceived as less effective and credible with little activation and

Rodero et al.

679

attention. Therefore, the results also showed that the optimal expressivity level was
moderate-high in gestures.
However, the critical part of the study is the combination of the different nonverbal
cues. The first important conclusion is that the expressivity level showed a descent line
from high to low (see Figure 4). The high expressivity load styles were those that
achieved the highest effectiveness, credibility, attention, and arousal levels and were
more positive in valence. Moreover, the correlations and regression analyses
between the self-report measures and physiological results showed that the more effective and credible participants perceived the message, the more attention they paid and
body activation or arousal they felt. Therefore, the more expressive the style, the higher
level of attention and autonomic arousal, as attention measured via HR increased with
high levels of activation of the sympathetic nervous system registered with EDA
(Bettiga et al., 2020). Along with this, there was a strong association among arousal
(EDA measurement and self-report), self-report valence, and the dependent variables.
All in all, this means that the results were very robust, as the conscious psychological
state reflecting more effectiveness and credibility in moderate-high expressive styles
was according to the unconscious physiological response allocating more resources
to cognitively process expressive messages (or more attention) and eliciting a stronger
emotional-motivational response in these concrete videos. The physiological measures,
especially EDA, influenced attitudes (credibility and effectiveness), as in the study by
Bettiga et al. (2017).
The second important conclusion is that intonation has been revealed as a very influential factor in combining the different nonverbal cues. Speech rate and gestures adjust
their expressivity load depending on intonation, especially gestures with a high variation depending on the rest of the elements. Moreover, the correlation results showed
that this prosody feature was the most influential when the nonverbal cues acted
together.
Examining the data, we can conclude that the findings can be explained following
the so-called Expressive Balance Effect, hypothesized in this study, which aligns with
the compensation hypothesis. The different nonverbal cues analyzed in this research
interacted to find an equilibrium or an expressive balance. We detected two different
internal rules in the effect. The first one is that the expressivity load has to be high.
To be perceived as effective and credible and to arouse a high activation and attention,
the nonverbal cues individually or in combination should place in a moderate-high
level of expressivity. If one of the features has a low load, the others must increase
it. The second internal rule is that intonation is the feature with the most significant
influence. The rest of the elements make a balancing effect by adjusting the needed
expressivity load to a moderate-high level.
This study can only be interpreted within the context of the laboratory experiment in
which it was conducted. One significant limitation was reproducing the analyzed styles
combining different nonverbal cues, and achieving a natural presentation.
Nevertheless, many training hours with the actors attained accurate and natural
styles. Another limitation is that we examined a limited number of nonverbal cues
and variations of these features. Further research should extend the number of

nonverbal cues and analyze if the effect found in this study is also produced with (a)
other changes and (b) different elements. Therefore, these studies could analyze other
intonation variations and types of gestures and other nonverbal features, such as facial
expressions or postures. Furthermore, future agenda should keep exploring individual
responses through combined methods, including physiological measures, as these techniques are a promising and beneficial approach. Finally, participants were exposed to
short speeches to reduce a possible fatigue problem, control the variables, and analyze
the great quantity of data registered in the physiological response, but future studies are
necessary to test long-length speeches and other types of messages and formats.

Conclusions
The first conclusion of this study is that the different nonverbal cues analyzed (intonation, speech rate, and gestures) must be used with a moderate expressivity load to be
perceived as effective and credible and with a high load to increase participants' emotional activation and attention. When these features act simultaneously, they combine
by compensating their load to attain a moderate-high expressivity level. This mechanism is what we have called the Expressive Balance Effect. This moderate-high
level of expressivity is perceived as the most effective and credible and achieved the
highest participants' attention and arousal. Consequently, this style is the most recommendable for speakers in public presentations. The second important conclusion is that
intonation has been revealed as a very influential factor in combining the different nonverbal cues. Therefore, these results have relevant academic and professional applications. First, this study extends the current research about the effects of combining
different nonverbal cues for successful public speaking performance. Second, the
results can also help communicative success in oral communication, learning languages, and teaching programs.
