Evidence suggests that cultural experiences and learning multiple languages have measurable effects on children's
development of executive function (EF). However, the precise impact of how bilingualism and culture contribute to observed
effects remains inconclusive. The present study aims to investigate how these factors shape the development of early EF
constructs longitudinally, between monolingual and bilingual children at ages 3, 31/2 and 4 years, with a set of EF tasks that
are uniquely relevant to the effects of bilingualism and cultural practices. We hypothesize that the effects of bilingualism and
cultural backgrounds (i.e., Eastern) are based on different, though related, cognitive control processes associated with
different EF constructs. Results revealed a significant bilingualism effect on cognitive control processes measuring selective
attention, switching, and inhibition; while an effect of culture was most pronounced on behavioral regulation/response
inhibition. Contributions of bilingualism and cultural experiences on individual EF constructs across development are
discussed.

Introduction
Executive Function (EF) is a construct referring to the
critical cognitive mechanisms that enable the individual
to control attention, monitor context, and select a relevant
action to navigate through task demands (Diamond, 2013).
While there is a notable correlation between EF and
academic readiness (Riggs, Blair & Greenberg, 2003;
Diamond, Barnett, Thomas & Munro, 2007; Blair &
Razza, 2007; Best, Miller & Naglieri, 2011), recent
literature indicates that the development of EF is largely
affected by individuals' everyday experiences such as
cultural practices and language learning. In particular,
better EF performance has been found in children
from Eastern cultures where early self-regulation is
emphasized (Oh & Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson,
Moses & Lee, 2006b; Yang, Yang & Lust, 2011; Tran,
Arredondo & Yoshida, 2015). Furthermore, an even larger
literature suggests that exposure and learning more than
one language generates cognitive competition that may

promote EF, an effect known as the "bilingual advantage"
(Costa, Hernandez & Sebastian-Galles, 2008; Kroll &
Bialystok, 2013; Sebastian-Galles, Albareda-Castellot,
Weikum & Werker, 2012; Singh et al., 2015; Wimmer &
Marx, 2014; Yoshida, Tran, Benitez & Kuwabara, 2011;
Yow & Markman, 2015; Yow, Li, Lam, Gliga, Chong,
Kwek & Broekman, 2017). The bilingual advantage is
broadly understood as bilinguals' enhanced cognitive
control ability when compared to their monolingual
counterparts. The effect is believed to stem from
bilinguals' daily exposure and use of multiple languages,
where learners are required to make fast and adaptive
changes from context-to-context (Bialystok, 1999, 2001;
Bialystok & Martin, 2004; Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008).
However, there are disputes regarding the robust
effects and independent contributions of bilingualism and
cultural experiences on the development of EF (Paap
& Greenberg, 2013; Anton et al., 2014; Dunabeitia,
Hernandez, Anton, Macizo, Estevez, Fuentes & Carreiras,
2014; Gathercole, Thomas, Kennedy, Prys, Young, Vinas
Guasch, Roberts, Hughes & Jones, 2014). There are three
key issues associated with the lack of robust effects.
First, although bilingual speakers are often immersed
in multiple cultural backgrounds, individuals' cultural
background may not always be controlled when testing
bilingual children. This has been an issue given the
increased studies suggesting the role of culture in EF
task performances (Carlson & Choi, 2008; Carlson &

Culture and bilingualism on executive function
Meltzoff, 2008; Sabbagh, Moses & Shiverick. 2006a;
Yang et al., 2011; Yang & Yang, 2016). Second, there
is an inconsistency in the literature associated with age.
The target age group is often narrowly selected to control
for other potential influences on cognitive outcomes, such
as language achievement and schooling, and thus may not
translate beyond the examined age (Anton, Dunabeitia,
Estevez, Hernandez, Castillo, Fuentes, Davidson &
Carreiras, 2014; Dunabeitia et al., 2014; Tare & Linck,
2011). As a result, previous studies may not always
capture the important trajectories of how experiences
interact with EF in early development, particularly during
the preschool period when EF is rapidly changing and
developing (Kopp, 1982; Carlson, 2005). Third, different
types of EF tasks may operate on different sub-skills -
attention, inhibition, task switching, and working memory
(Anderson, 1989; Welsh, Pennington & Groisser, 1991;
Zelazo, Carter, Reznick & Frye, 1997), yet there is
not a clear understanding of the type of experiences
different EF tasks are sensitive to. In particular, studies
often select a target task to minimize potential confounds
when examining various factors, which may leave out the
possibility that bilingualism and culture may differentially
impact cognitive performances when different EF tasks
are considered. The present study addresses these issues
in a single study to document the precise nature of
the potential impact of bilingualism and culture on the
development of early EF.
Culture and executive function
One way of assessing distinctions between Eastern
and Western cultures is based on the structural degree
of these societies as they differ in relation to their
citizens' goals, needs, collectivism and individualism
(Triandis, 1994, 1995). Eastern (or collectivistic) cultures
place emphasis on obedience to authority figures,
interdependence among peers, early maintenance of selfregulation, strict academic training, structured instruction
on self-regulating responses, and less focus on the
importance of recreation (Tobin, Wu & Davidson, 1989;
Ho, 1994; Wu, 1996; Chen, Hastings, Rubin, Chen, Cen &
Stewart, 1998; Nisbett, Peng, Choi & Norenzayan, 2001;
Parmar, Harkness & Super, 2004; Oh & Lewis, 2008).
Western (or individualistic) cultures, on the other hand,
value practices of individualism, independence, selfexpression, and recreation (Ahadi, Rothbart & Ye, 1993;
Chao & Tseng, 2002; Parmar, Harkness & Super, 2004).
Cross-cultural studies have reported how Eastern and
Western cultural practices affect EF processes differently
(Witkin & Berry, 1975; Markus & Kitayama, 1991;
Nisbett et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2011; Tran et al.,
2015). In particular, individuals' cultural backgrounds
have been linked to differences in attentional control
in adults and children (Oh & Lewis, 2008; Varnum,

715

Grossmann, Kitayama & Nisbett, 2009; Yang et al.,
2011; Kuwabara & Smith, 2012; Tran et al., 2015).
For example, four-year-old monolingual children from
Korea respond more accurately than their monolingual
peers from the U.S. on cognitive measures of attention
(Yang et al., 2011). This Korean cultural advantage has
been explained through the Eastern values of disciplined
behavior and self-regulation (Chao & Tseng, 2002; Chen
et al., 1998). Previous studies have also linked Eastern
cultural experiences to children's task performances that
are relevant to RESPONSE INHIBITION, such as those found
in delay of gratification tasks (Oh & Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh
et al., 2006a). Delay of gratification tasks require children
to inhibit prepotent responses, such as peeking while the
experimenter is wrapping the gift (Gift Delay task) or
taking the marshmallow when the experimenter is not
present (Marshmallow task), to receive a reward (Mischel,
Ebbesen & Zeiss, 1972; Kochanska, Murray, Jacques,
Koenig & Vandegeest, 1996). Other variants of response
inhibition tasks include the Day/Night task where children
are instructed to say "day" when shown a moon card
and "night" when shown a sun card (Gerstadt, Hong &
Diamond, 1994), and the Bear/Dragon where children
perform motor movements when the bear instructs and
resist when the dragon commands (Reed, Pien & Rothbart,
1984). These tasks do not require children to recruit
multiple cognitive processes for task success, such as
flexibility, switching, and monitoring of attention, which
are vital in tasks that switch between different rules or
dimensions within the same task, such as the Dimensional
Change Card Sorting task (Bialystok, 2017).
In comparison to those tested in Eastern cultures,
children from Latin American cultures have received
little attention in terms of EF measurement. However,
a study by Bornstein and Cote (2004) compared mothers'
parenting cognitions, specifically attributions about childrearing and self-perceptions of parenting effectiveness
across different cultures (Japanese, Argentine, and
European American in the U.S.) and found that Argentine
mothers held parenting views and cognitions that were
more closely related to those of European American
mothers in the U.S. than Japanese mothers. This finding
demonstrates in part that Argentines hold cultural attitudes
and behaviors that are between the two extremes
of individualism and collectivism, whereas Americans
in the U.S. are classified on the extreme end of
individualism (Triandis, 1995; Haskins & Eggleston,
2003). Furthermore, research has identified Argentina as
having a "less-tight" collective societal structure (versus
a more structured collectivistic country such as China),
where individuals are considered more liberal-minded
and able to express themselves by allowing deviation
from the rules and setting fewer standards in their social
context (Burns & Charlip, 2006; Triandis, 1994, 1999;
Haskin & Eggleston, 2003). The present study focuses

on three cultures (Western, Latin American, and Eastern)
that differ in the degrees of individualism/collectivism to
document how cultures with different societal structure
may influence cognitive performance measuring response
inhibition and their relation to bilingualism.

Bilingualism and executive function
In contrast to cultural influences on response inhibition
performance, the bilingual cognitive advantage has often
been documented in EF tasks that require multiple
dimensional shifts. Dimensional shifting tasks require
cognitive control processes including monitoring of
source information, switching between multiple rules,
selective attention to the relevant feature, and the
suppression of stimulus interference (Bialystok &
Martin, 2004; Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee
& Bialystok, 2008). Dimension Change Card Sorting
(DCCS; Zelazo, Frye & Rapus, 1996) is a common
dimensional shifting task that has been linked to bilingual
advantage in preschoolers (Bialystok & Martin, 2004;
Martin-Rhee & Bialystok, 2008). In the DCCS task,
children are asked to first sort a set of bi-dimensional
cards by attending to one dimension (pre-switch; e.g.,
shape), then they are asked to sort the same cards by
shifting their attention to another dimension (post-switch;
e.g., color). As such, co-activation of two rules, inhibition
of the tendency to attend to a previous relevant feature
(e.g., shape), selective attention to the newly relevant
feature (e.g., color), and flexible switching between both
dimensions are required for success in the DCCS task
(Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008; Frye, Zelazo & Palfai, 1995;
Zelazo, Muller, Frye & Marcovitch, 2003; Kloo & Perner,
2005; Fisher, 2011). See Table 1 for processes associated
with each EF task employed in the present study.
These overlapping cognitive processes are also relevant
to the way bilingual children learn and process two
languages at the same time (Bialystok, 2001), where
co-activation of two languages in the bilingual brain
is required for successful language comprehension and
production (Bialystok, 2017; Blumenfeld & Marian,
2007; Brysbaert, 1998; Francis, 1999; Gollan & Kroll,
2001; Guttentag, Haith, Goodman & Hauch, 1984;
Kroll & Dijkstra, 2002; Smith, 1997). Thus, language
processing and selection taps into a general executive
system for successful switching between two different
languages, that requires selective attention to the relevant
language and inhibition of the non-relevant language
(Bialystok, 2017; Bialystok & Martin, 2004; Kroll &
Bialystok, 2013). Therefore, the present study specifically
tests bilingual children by including EF measures that
are relevant to the overlapping processes sensitive to the
bilingual cognitive effect.
Furthermore, recent literature on bilingualism
indicates that diverse bilingual profiles, such as the

Day/Night

Bear Dragon
Gift Delay

degree of bilingualism, language-switching experiences,
and script variation, impact EF and yield different
outcomes (for a comprehensive review see Schwieter,
2016). For instance, research by Leon-Guerrero, Smith
and Luk (2016) suggests that the daily use of
bilingual preschoolers' non-dominant language (along
with chronological age) has a direct impact on EF tasks.
This research highlights the importance of daily bilingual
usage and consideration of both languages - dominant
and non-dominant - when analyzing the relationship
between bilingualism and EF. Moreover, a recent study
with children from middle-socioeconomic backgrounds
revealed bilingual (Russian-Hebrew) children who were
proficient (balanced) in both languages outperformed
Hebrew monolinguals and unbalanced bilingual (i.e.,
those who were more proficient in one language,
Russian or Hebrew) on EF tasks measuring response
inhibition and shifting (Prior, Goldwasser, Ravet-Hirsh &
Schwartz, 2016). The present study aims to control SES,
vocabulary knowledge, and bilingual language history
while following up on the developmental periods when EF
is rapidly changing to address the influences of bilingual
and cultural experiences on EF performances.
Additive effects of bilingualism and culture
Interestingly, recent cross-cultural work has suggested
the potential role of additive effects on cognitive task
performances. Research by Yang et al. (2011) documented
that four-year-old Korean-English bilinguals in the
U.S. outperformed monolinguals in Korea and in the
U.S. (while Korean monolinguals outperform English

monolinguals) on the Attention Network Test (ANT;
Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz & Posner, 2002), a nonverbal attention control measure. This additive effect is
considered in terms of the combined effect of bilingualism
and culture, where processes inherent in bilinguals'
enhanced cognitive control ability and in Eastern cultural
emphasis on early behavioral regulation enhances EF
performance (Yang et al., 2011). However, precisely
HOW bilingual and cultural experiences influence EF
task performances is not clearly understood. Previous
reports on the independent EF effects via bilingualism
and cultural experiences (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &
Martin, 2004; Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008; Kalashnikova
& Mattock, 2014; Okanda, Moriguchi & Itakura, 2010;
Oh & Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006a) suggests
processes related to response inhibition may be influenced
by culture, while tasks measuring general cognitive
control abilities (including response inhibition) may
also be sensitive to bilingualism. The present study
will document whether the additive effect is separately
combined or integrated, by documenting the development
of response inhibition processes when bilingual and
cultural experiences co-occur.
Culture specification
The present study includes three countries: the
United States (U.S.), Argentina, and Vietnam, each
representing Western, Latin American, and Eastern
cultures, respectively in terms of the degrees of
individualism to collectivism (Hofstede, 1980, 1991,
2001; Vuong, 1976; Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler
& Tipton, 1985; Gold, 1992a, 1992b; Ho & Chiu, 1994;
Lytle, Brett, Barsness, Tinsley & Janssens, 1994; Nowak,
1998; Parrado & Cerrutti, 2003). An established coding
scheme based on the degree of societal structure of
different cultures was implemented to classify participants
into distinct cultural groups for analysis (see Table 2).

In particular, participants are coded based on how each
country was rated on Hofstede's scale of individualismcollectivism dimension, where cultures are described
from `loosely' structured to `tightly' integrated (Hofstede,
1980, 1991, 2001). This provided a quantifiable scale
- collectivism and individualism - to base the present
classification of the cultural groups. Specifically, the U.S.
ranked #1, and Argentina ranked #22-23 (mid-range) on
the individualism-collectivism dimension scale (out of 53;
lower scores indicate individualism, higher scores indicate
collectivism).
While Vietnam was not ranked in Hofstede's original
scale, the current classification was based on the four
associations pooled for the individualism-collectivism
data: (1) Wealth: there is a strong relationship between
a nation's wealth and individualism, (2) Geography:
countries with moderate and cold climates tend to show
more individualism, (3) Birth rates: countries with higher
birth rates tend to be collectivistic, and (4) History:
Confucian countries are collectivistic. As such, based
on the country's wealth (relatively poor), geography (hot
climate), birth rates (high), and history (heavily influenced
by Confucian values due to China's ruling for over 1,000
years), Vietnam was classified as highly collectivistic
on the proposed scale (see Table 2). Moreover, similar
and surrounding countries to Vietnam were ranked as
follows on the individualism-collectivism scale: Hong
Kong #37, Singapore #39-41, Thailand #39-41, Taiwan
#44, and Indonesia rated #47-48 (Hofstede, 2001, Exhibit
5.1, p. 215).
By recruiting Vietnamese children, whose cultural
contribution in cognitive development has not been
explored, we ask a new question: how does culture
influence the development of bilingual cognitive
advantage during the preschool years? In particular, with
the inclusion of Vietnamese-English and Vietnamese-
Cantonese bilinguals, we may begin to address how
differences in cultural structures may interact with

718

Crystal D. Tran, Maria M. Arredondo and Hanako Yoshida

bilingualism to influence EF task performance. The
inclusion of Vietnamese-English bilinguals from the U.S.
will address the influences of the two extreme ends of
culture - collectivism and individualism - as well as
Vietnamese-Cantonese bilinguals from Vietnam in order
to encompass "tightly integrated" collectivism. Moreover,
by including monolingual English from the U.S. and
monolingual Vietnamese from Vietnam, the design allows
for systematic comparisons between different language
groups. Therefore, the study presents a systematic design
to fill the critical gap in the bilingual literature, while
delving deeper to understand the underlying mechanisms
that are influenced by different cultural structures.
Overview
In order to investigate how bilingualism and culture influence the development of EF, the present study includes
monolingual (English, Vietnamese, and Spanish) and
bilingual (Vietnamese-English, Vietnamese-Cantonese,
and Spanish-English) children from three distinct cultures
varying in the degree of collectivistic practices. These
children were tested longitudinally at three developmental
periods (age 3, 3.5, and 4 years) in four EF tasks that
have previously demonstrated independent influences of
bilingualism and culture (Bialystok & Martin, 2004;
Martin-Rhee & Bialystok, 2008; Oh & Lewis, 2008;
Sabbagh et al., 2006a).
We hypothesize that: first, the bilingual advantage
effect may be more sensitive to cognitive control
processes typically required in tasks involving different
rules/dimensions (e.g., the DCCS), such as selective
attention, switching, inhibition, and monitoring, due to
similar EF mechanisms required in bilingual language
processing (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok & Martin, 2004;
Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008; Kalashnikova & Mattock,
2014; Okanda et al., 2010). Second, the culture effect
may be attuned to response inhibition processes typically
found in single dimension tasks, such as the Day/Night,
Bear/Dragon, Gift Delay task, due to specific cultural
practices emphasizing early behavioral self-regulation
(Gerstadt et al., 1994; Bernstein, Atance, Meltzoff &
Loftus, 2007; Carlson & Moses, 2001; Carlson, 2005;
Chasiotis, Kiessling, Hofer & Campos, 2006; Oh &
Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006a; Montgomery,
Anderson & Uhl, 2008). Finally, the potential combined
effects of bilingualism and culture may appear in tasks
measuring response inhibition specifically when Eastern
culture is considered. In particular, we expect bilingual
Vietnamese children (Vietnamese-English in the U.S.
and Vietnamese-Cantonese in Vietnam) to outperform
their non-Eastern monolingual counterparts (English
in the U.S., Spanish in Argentina) on the Day/Night,
Bear/Dragon, and Gift Delay task. In this manner,
the development of response inhibition/self-regulation

processes may be enhanced when specific language status
(bilingualism) and cultural groups (Eastern) are coupled.
Method
Participants
Ninety-six 3-year-old (Mean age [Mage ] = 38.78 months)
monolingual and bilingual children from three countries
(U.S., Argentina, and Vietnam) participated in 3 separate
sessions every 6 months (Mage = 45.35 months at Time 2,
Mage = 51.20 months at time 3). Children were recruited
from communities in Houston, Texas, U.S.; San Miguel
de Tucuman in Argentina; and ng Nai in Vietnam. See
Table 3 for specific characteristics regarding each sample
including size, age, and language status across the time
points and sites.
Monolingual and bilingual children were recruited
in the U.S. and Vietnam. No bilingual children were
recruited in Argentina since they did not share similar
learning environments (i.e., strong tendency to attend
small private learning centers) and were of higher SES
backgrounds than the monolingual sample in Argentina
and bilinguals in the U.S. and Vietnam. Given that high
SES has measurable effects on children's cognitive task
performances (e.g., Mezzacappa, 2004; Noble, Norman
& Farah, 2005), bilingual Argentinean children who were
initially recruited and screened were not included for
subsequent longitudinal testing on the EF tasks.
At the time of testing, all of the bilingual children
(in the U.S. and Vietnam) were simultaneous bilinguals.
Specifically, bilingual children in the U.S. were born in the
U.S., had at least one immigrant parent, and were regularly
exposed to English and their parents' non-English native
language from birth. Both English and the non-English
language were regularly spoken at home by at least one
parent, while English was primarily spoken outside of the
home. On the other hand, bilingual children in Vietnam
were born in Vietnam, had at least one parent fluent in
Cantonese, and were regularly exposed to Vietnamese and
Cantonese from birth. Both languages were spoken at
home, with Vietnamese predominately spoken outside of
the home.
Moreover, all bilingual children in the U.S. were
second-generation immigrants (i.e., American born with
first-generation immigrant parents). Previous research
suggests that first-generation immigrants typically adhere
to their culture of origin (e.g., more "Eastern" for
Vietnamese-English children from the U.S.), while thirdgeneration immigrants typically assimilate to their culture
of residence (e.g., more "Western" for Vietnamese-
English children from the U.S.; Matsuoka, 1990; Phinney,
Ong & Madden, 2000). The Vietnamese-Cantonese
bilinguals, however, were recruited at the local Chinese
community center in ng Nai, Vietnam, and had a

China from prior generations.
Finally, children who took part in the study were
selected to fall within the middle SES range (50th
percentile) during the year of data collection (2008-2009).
The middle SES income range for each country (based on
national statistics) were as follows: $50,000 to $74,999 for
the U.S. (John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
Research Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health),
15.500 to 21.499 pesos for Argentina (Development
Economics LDB database, 2008), and 10,400,000 to
13,199,999 ng for Vietnam (Development Economics
LDB database, 2008). Lastly, the middle SES status
also included parental education, which is suggested
to play a vital role in children's cognitive development
and academic achievement (Smith, Brooks-Gunn &
Klebanov, 1997; Bradley & Corwyn, 2002; DavisKean, 2005; Biedinger, 2011). Thus, SES measures of
household income and parental education were analyzed
individually; see Table 4.
Measures
DCCS task (Zelazo et al., 2003)
Adapted from the original study by Zelazo et al. (1996),
the stimuli consisted of a set of cards with two shapes
(rabbit, boat) and two colors (pink, blue). There were a
total of 32 cards (16 shape-matched, but different color;
16 color-matched, but different shape). The DCCS task
has two phases: pre-switch and post-switch. There were

a total of 32 trials, of which 16 were pre-switching
trials. The child's initial response determined the order
of the dimension tested first (shape/color), when the child
was first presented with a card (e.g., a pink rabbit) and
asked to tell the experimenter what they saw. If the child
mentioned the shape (rabbit), then the child was asked
to sort the cards by shape (and vice versa for color
response). Immediately after this sorting (pre-switching
trials), children were instructed to sort a stack of 16 cards
by the other dimension (post-switching trials) as quickly as
possible. To establish prepotent responses and effectively
test the ability to switch, it was critical for children to
successfully sort the first dimension in the pre-switching
trials. Thus, children were encouraged during the preswitch phase to ensure that they sorted at least ten cards
(62.5 %, above chance) correctly during the pre-switching
trials. The proportion of successful post-switch scores
was considered to measure children's ability to switch
dimensions and used in the analysis.
Day/Night task (Gerstadt, Hong & Diamond, 1994)
The experimenter engaged children in a conversation
about when the sun and the moon come up (i.e., during the
day and the night). Children were then presented with a
card of a white background and a yellow sun, as well as a
card with a black background and a white moon. Children
were then instructed to respond "night" when shown the
sun card and "day" when shown the moon card. After children had been able to assert the correct answer verbally,
they proceeded with the 16 follow-up test trials. Children's

responses were either day or night. In this task, children
are required to selectively produce the correct (opposite)
verbal response of the new association, which involves
inhibition of previously learned associations (i.e., the sun
comes out during the day, the moon comes out during
the night). The number of correct responses was recorded
and used in the analysis. The order of presentation used
by Gerstadt et al. (1994) was implemented.
Bear/Dragon task (Reed et al., 1984)
Similar to the Simon Says game, children were instructed
to perform ten motor commands as instructed by two
puppets - a bear or a dragon. Participants were introduced
to "Mr. Bear" (in an excited tone of voice) and "Mr.
Dragon" (in a deep voice). The objective of the task is
for the child to perform correct motor movements when
Mr. Bear instructs and refraining from movement when
Mr. Dragon commands. After training, participants were
presented with ten trials of different motor commands
from the bear and dragon in alternating order. For example,
"Mr. Bear says, touch your nose" and "Mr. Dragon says,
touch your head". Therefore, success on the Bear/Dragon
task involves complex motor response inhibition where
children must selectively attend to the correct motor
command and inhibit prepotent motor responses (Reed
et al., 1984; Carlson & Moses, 2001; Carlson, 2005;
Kochanska, Murray & Harlan, 2000; Sabbagh et al.,
2006a). The number of correct motor actions performed
and inhibited was recorded and used for later analysis.
Gift Delay task (Konchaska et al., 1996)
Children were told that they did a good job and
that they would receive a gift for their participation.
However, the experimenter "forgot" to wrap the gift,
children were then instructed to turn around in their
seat while the experimenter wrapped their surprise gift.
The experimenter then rifled with the wrapper (gift bag)
noisily for 60 seconds, as timed by a stopwatch and
peeking behavior was video-recorded. Success on the Gift
Delay task involves simple motor response inhibition,
where children must self-regulate from turning around,

such as peeking or impulsive behavior (Konchaska et al.,
1996; Gerstadt et al., 1994; Carlson & Moses, 2001). The
number of seconds spent peeking (from 60 seconds) was
recorded, and proportions of the non-peeking time were
marked as "correct" responses and used for later analysis.

Other measures
Children's demographic assessments were conducted
using the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
Research Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health,
a parent questionnaire consisting of 16 questions on
SES and their child's health. Parental education and
income were included in the analysis. Parents were
also asked to complete the MacArthur Communicative
Developmental Inventory (MCDI) toddler form for
the language(s) that their child spoke (Fenson, Dale,
Reznick, Thal, Bates, Hartung, Pethick & Reilly, 1993).
Children's productive vocabularies were screened to
predict developmental delays across the language groups.
The MCDI checklist forms for English, Chinese, and
Spanish were independently developed and normalized
(Fenson et al., 1993; Ogura & Watamaki, 1997; also
Ogura, Yamashita, Murase & Dale, 1993). Due to a
lack of a Vietnamese MCDI vocabulary checklist form,
one was developed by adapting from the Chinese and
Japanese MCDIs with replacements of items native to the
Vietnamese culture (i.e., food, drinks). Parents of bilingual
children were asked to fill out two vocabulary checklists
corresponding to the languages their child was regularly
exposed to in their environment. In the present sample,
we included children whose total vocabulary was above
the 20th percentile.
For productive vocabulary scores, the number of words
(i.e., total, noun, verbs, adjectives) in the dominant
language, total language/s (combined languages for
bilinguals), and conceptual knowledge were computed.
To fairly assess and compare bilinguals' language
knowledge, conceptual knowledge was calculated by
subtracting overlapping words known in both languages
from the total number of concepts known in both

languages. Conceptual knowledge is considered a more
valid measure of bilinguals' vocabulary knowledge,
especially when comparing them with their monolingual
counterparts (Umbel, Pearson, Fernandez & Oller, 1992;
Pearson, Fernandez & Oller, 1993; Alvarado, 2000;
Bialystok, 2001; Oller & Pearson, 2002; Oller, 2005). An
analysis comparing conceptual vocabularies between the
language and cultural groups demonstrated no significant
differences (p >.1). See Table 5.
Procedure
During each visit, parents completed the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur SES and MCDI forms. All testing
sessions with children were conducted one-on-one with
an experimenter in a quiet room, where children were
instructed to sit on a small chair directly across from the
experimenter. A mobile video camera attached to a tripod
was set up at the corner of the room to record each experimental session for future behavioral coding and analysis.
The order of the tasks was counterbalanced for each
assessment and randomized across each testing session.
Analysis strategies
To ensure reliability across testing sites, the same
experimenter administered the tasks at each respective
site every six months (i.e., the first author tested subjects
in Vietnam and the U.S., while the second author tested
subjects in Argentina and the U.S.). The experimenters
were both trained at the same institution; every effort
was made to ensure that task procedures, stimuli, and
measures were identical. Finally, statistical analyses were
implemented to ensure the reliability of test scores.
In particular, Cronbach's Alpha tests were performed
within each country to ensure the reliability across
the three testing sites, where higher values of alpha
are considered more desirable for internal consistency
(Cronbach, 1951). Results from the composite scores of
all EF tasks indicate their consistency across test sites;

alpha scores of .620, .743, and .811 for the U.S., Argentina,
and Vietnam, respectively. Scores from Argentina and
Vietnam indicate that internal consistency ranged from
fair to good, respectively. Although the alpha score for
the U.S. approached "fair" for internal consistency (i.e.,
>.70), the questionable score may be due in part to
the inclusion of various cultural and language groups
within the sample. Specifically, the U.S. included bilingual
Argentinean-American and Vietnamese-American, as
well as monolingual English children.
A series of linear mixed model analyses were
performed for the present data due to the repeated
measurements (made on the same statistical units), small
sample size per group, fixed effects (e.g., language status),
and random effects (e.g., time point) included in the
present design (Laird & Ware, 1982; McLean, Sanders
& Stroup, 1991; Singer & Willett, 2003).
The primary question was how bilingualism and
culture influence the development of specific EF
processes. To address this question, we first examine
whether the bilingual advantage effect is more sensitive
to tasks involving multiple stimulus dimensions (than
single dimensional tasks; i.e., the DCCS), where selective
attention, switching, inhibition, and monitoring processes
are required for task success. We then examined whether
culture may be more influential on processes involved in
response inhibition tasks (than dimensional shifting tasks
that involve multiple processes), such as the Day/Night,
Bear/Dragon, and Gift Delay tasks. Finally, we considered
the secondary question regarding the additive effect
by testing whether culture AND bilingualism generate
significant effects on EF tasks that recruit response
inhibition processes for task success.
By identifying specific effects of bilingualism and
culture on each EF task, the study will reveal the
sensitivities of specific EF processes in relation to
different language and cultural backgrounds. Thus, for
general main effects, we conducted an ANOVA on
the model of best fit for each EF task (i.e., DCCS,
Day/Night, Bear/Dragon, Gift Delay). For this analysis,

722

Crystal D. Tran, Maria M. Arredondo and Hanako Yoshida

the effect of Time (1, 2, and 3; random factor), language
status (bilingual and monolingual; fixed factor), culture
(Western, Latin American, and Eastern; fixed factor),
SES (education and income; fixed factor), Time and
language status interaction, Time and culture interaction,
and language status and culture interaction were used to
predict the EF task scores.
Model comparisons using baseline comparison group
Basing on the model of best fit1 for each respective EF
task, differences were primarily found with (or without)
the inclusion of SES in the mixed model. While both
SES measures - education and income - were included in
the model of best fit for the DCCS and Day/Night tasks,
indicating the relevancy of Education specific to DCCS
and Day/Night tasks, only SES - income - was included
in the model of best fit for the Bear/Dragon and Gift Delay
tasks.
For the four EF task models, the unconditional random
intercept model was centered with monolingual (language
status; fixed factor), Western (culture; fixed factor), Time
1 (random factor), and SES (education and income;
fixed factors) as the baseline comparison group. The
unconditional random intercept and random slope model
allows Time and intercept to vary across individuals,
with all other factors - language status, culture, SES,
and interactions among factors - to be fixed. Correlations
among individuals were controlled, allowing slope and
intercept to vary.
Examining effect sizes with parameter estimates
Parameter estimates, standard errors, test-statistics, and
corresponding p-values were obtained for each model
in order to understand the precise magnitude of specific
factors on task performances. The effect size of each factor
was considered when all other factors were controlled
at 0, to better understand the precise effect of each
factor on task performances when all others factors were
controlled. The parameter estimates were standardized
by taking the difference of the performance scores of
each individual from the grand mean for each task at
Time 1, where scores were calculated from the standard
1

Model of Best Fit. We compared models to an unconditional random
intercept model (baseline). For both the overall combined and separate
models, the unconditional random intercept model was centered with
monolingual (language status; fixed factor), Western (culture; fixed
factor), time 1 (random factor), and SES (education and income; fixed
factors) as the baseline comparison group. We selected a random
intercept and random slope model allowing time and intercept to vary
across individuals, with all other factors - language status, culture,
SES, and interactions among factors - to be fixed. Correlations among
individuals were controlled for, allowing slope and intercept to vary.
To evaluate the models of best fit, one goodness-of-fit index was
used (e.g., Singer & Willett, 2003): the Akaike's information criterion
(AIC).

deviation of performance score for each individual
and then considered in terms of proportion (with a
maximum effect size of 1.0). Therefore, values closer
to "0" indicate little to no effect on task performances,
whereas values closer to "1.0" demonstrate a large effect
on task performances. Moreover, positive or negative
parameter values demonstrate the direction of the effect
size of individual factors on task performances over
time (i.e., positive values indicate that the examined
factor increases/benefits task performance score over
time, whereas negative values indicate the opposite).
Significant effect sizes are reported below.
Results
Overall task performances
Overall, bilingual children demonstrate better performance than their monolingual peers in the DCCS,
Day/Night, and Gift Delay task (p < .001, p < .01,
p < .05, respectively). Children from Eastern culture,
however, outperformed Western and Latin American
children in the Day/Night task (p < .001). See Figure 1
for individual group performances, and Table 6 for mean
proportion and standard deviations (SD), on the DCCS,
Day/Night, Bear/Dragon, and Gift Delay tasks at each
time point. Analyses on skew and kurtosis at each time
point for individual EF tasks indicate that the data were
normally distributed (skew = 2, kurtosis = 3), with the
exception of performance of Vietnamese monolinguals on
the Gift Delay at Time 2 (skew = -3.3, kurtosis = 12.1).
Further analyses indicate the inclusion of one extreme
outlier, whose performance on the Gift Delay at Time 2
was .55 (from the general group mean of .97, SD = .05).
Central to the research aims, we delve into significant
effects between individual groups and report their trends
(in detail) below.
Model analyses
To better understand the contributing factors -
bilingualism and cultural background - and its relation
to specific EF processes, results of the model analyses on
each EF models are reported.
DCCS task
As shown in Figure 2, bilingual children outperformed
monolingual children (baseline comparison model) in
the DCCS task (F(1, 76) = 26.12, p < .001), with
their performance improving with age (F(1, 94) = 8.46,
p < .001). Interactions between Time and language status
were significant, F(1, 97) = 3.05, p < .05, indicating
sharp developmental improvements for monolingual
children's task performance. Importantly, parameter
estimate comparisons indicate that the largest effect size

was seen among language status (0.34, SE = 0.07;
p < .001), indicating that performance on the DCCS
task was largely influenced by bilingualism. Post-hoc
analyses (Tukey's) further revealed that Vietnamese-
English bilinguals outperformed Spanish monolinguals
at Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 (p = .001, p = .013,
p = .004, respectively), and Vietnamese monolinguals
at Time 1 and Time 3 (p = .004, p = .032, respectively),
while Spanish-English bilinguals outperformed Spanish
monolinguals at Time 1 (p = .004), indicating that
bilinguals generally outperformed their monolingual
counterparts across different time points; see Figure 1a.
The second largest effect size can be seen with Time,
which indicates that all children improved in the task at
subsequent time points regardless of other factors (0.11,
SE = 0.05; p < .01).
Essential to the study's aims in regards to investigating
the separate processes relevant for bilingual and cultural
effects, there were no reliable differences (p > .1) among
the cultural groups in the DCCS task performances.

Although there were no main effects of culture on the
DCCS task, significant parameter estimates for Latin
American bilinguals (i.e., Spanish-English bilinguals in
the U.S.) indicate that, in comparison to the intercept, they
demonstrated the least amount of change on the DCCS
task over Time (p < .05). See Figure 2 for the magnitude
of each effect size from "0".
Day/Night task
As expected, children from Eastern cultural backgrounds
outperformed children from other cultures on the
Day/Night task, F(3, 108) = 4.40, p < .001, with
their performance improving across development, F(1,
143) = 14.59, p < .001. Interactions between Time
and culture were significant, F(3, 144) = 3.54,
p < .01, further suggesting that Day/Night performance
was mediated by different cultural backgrounds across
subsequent time points. Detailed analysis on parameter
estimates further indicates that the largest effect size
was seen in children from Eastern cultures (0.24,

SE = 0.12; p < .01), revealing an advantageous influence
of Eastern culture on the Day/Night task. Specifically,
post-hoc analyses (Tukey's) demonstrated that children in
Eastern culture (Vietnamese monolinguals, Vietnamese-
Cantonese bilinguals) outperformed Western children
(English monolingual) at Time 1 (p = .010) and
Latin American children (Spanish-English bilingual)
at Time 2 (p = .042), indicating an Eastern cultural
advantage regardless of language status. However,
parameter estimates for the Time and culture (Eastern)
interaction were relatively small (-0.15, SE = 0.08;
p<.05), indicating that although Eastern children initially
performed significantly better than their Western and Latin
American peers, the children caught up at subsequent time
points. Regardless of cultural or language background,
all children improved on their task performance in
subsequent time points (0.14, SE = 0.06; p < .01).
Moreover, significant main effects of language
status demonstrate that bilingual children outperformed
their monolingual peers in the Day/Night task, F(1,
101) = 5.92, p < .01, with language status having a
moderately smaller effect size than the Eastern culture
effect at Time 1 (0.21, SE = 0.09; p < .01). For
complete parameter estimates, see Figure 2. Critical to
the relation between language and cultural effects, a
significant main effect was found for the language
status and culture interaction, F(2, 86) = 7.57, p <.01,
which supports the present hypothesis regarding the
potential additive effects of bilingualism and culture on
task performance measuring response inhibition. Posthoc analyses further indicated that Vietnamese-English
bilinguals outperformed English monolinguals at Time
1 (p = .026) and Spanish monolinguals at Time 1 and
Time 2 (p = .046, p = .009, respectively). Vietnamese-
Cantonese outperformed English monolinguals at Time
1 (p = .030) and Spanish monolinguals at Time 2
(p = .035). These results indicated that Eastern bilingual
children outperformed their non-Eastern monolingual
peers, but not their Eastern monolingual counterparts; see
Figure 1b.
Bear/Dragon task
For the Bear/Dragon task, children's performance
improved significantly with age (F(1, 127) . = 75.04, p
< .001), where Time demonstrated the largest effect size
on task performances (0.16, SE = 0.04; p < .001); see
Figure 1c. However, contrary to the present hypothesis,
there were no main effects of language status, culture,
SES, between Time and language status, between Time
and culture, or language status and culture interaction
on task performances. Detailed analyses on parameter
estimates further confirmed that the effect sizes of
language status (0.07, SE = 0.05; n.s.) and culture
(Eastern, Western, Latin American; 0.00, SE = 0.06; n.s.,
0.04, SE = 0.07; n.s., 0.01, SE = 0.09; n.s., respectively)

were non-significant, indicating that bilingualism and
culture has little effect on the Bear/Dragon task
performances. Therefore, as indicated in Figure 2 with all
parameters close to "0", results suggest that performance

in the Bear/Dragon task is the least affected by language
status and cultural influences, with significant effects
found exclusively in children's improvement on task
performances over Time (age).

Gift/Delay task
Finally, children's performance on the Gift Delay increased significantly with age, F(1, 93) = 19.14, p < .001,
with bilinguals outperforming monolinguals, F(1,
75) = 3.21, p < .05. Further detailed analyses of parameter
estimates indicated that the effect size for language status
is the largest for the Gift Delay task (0.12, SE = 0.07;
p < 05), although it is relatively small in comparison to
the DCCS and Day/Night task; see Figure 2. Further posthoc analyses reveal that monolingual Spanish children
performed significantly worse than monolingual English
children at Time 2 (p = .004), Spanish-English children at
Time 2 (p = .015), Vietnamese-English children at Time
2 (p = .004), and Vietnamese monolinguals at Time 2
and Time 3 (p = .001, p = .026, respectively), indicating
that children in Argentina generally have a difficult time
inhibiting the prepotent response (to peek); see Figure 1d.
However, contrary to the present hypothesis, there were no
main effects of culture, SES, between Time and language
status, nor between Time and culture interaction.
Discussion
The present study addresses how cultural background
and bilingual experiences influence the development of
EF task performances when relevant factors such as
language history, SES, and vocabulary are controlled. In
the present study, a bilingual cognitive advantage was
replicated in dimensional shifting (i.e., DCCS) and in
two tasks assessing response inhibition including verbal
response inhibition (i.e., Day/Night) and motor response
inhibition (i.e., Gift Delay tasks) with the largest bilingual
advantage effect demonstrated on dimensional shifting. In
contrast, the findings demonstrated that the cultural effect
was most pronounced in the verbal response inhibition and
remained significant at subsequent time points. Moreover,
significant interaction effects of bilingualism and culture
on verbal response inhibition suggests the integrated
nature of additive effects on task results. These results
shed light on the differential influence of bilingualism and
culture on distinct EF processes in early development.
Global bilingual cognitive advantage
The stronger link between bilingualism and processes
involved in the DCCS task coincide with the idea
that switching and selectively attending between two
dimensions (i.e., shape, color) may involve processes
similar to switching attention and inhibiting between two
languages for bilingual learners. Here, the joint activity
of bilinguals' dual-language system involves cognitive
control processes, such as selective attention, monitoring,
switching, and inhibition, to keep the languages separate
(Blumenfeld & Marian, 2007; Brysbaert, 1998; Francis,
1999; Gollan & Kroll, 2001; Guttentag et al., 1984; Kroll

& Dijkstra, 2002; Smith, 1997). This, therefore, works in
parallel to processes involved for successful performance
in dimensional shifting. The assumptions are that these
mechanisms are a part of a domain-general process and
that the constant engagement of this process for language
selection transfers to cognitive performance. Support for
the notion that a domain-general system is recruited for
language control derives from neuroimaging evidence
demonstrating an overlap in brain networks involved
in language selection and nonverbal task switching
(Abutalebi & Green, 2007; De Baene, Duyck, Brass &
Carreiras, 2015; Luk, Green Abutalebi & Grady, 2012).
Accordingly, the demands of bilingual language
processing further replicate and support previous reported
findings of bilingual advantage in EF (Arredondo,
Hu, Satterfield & Kovelman, 2016; Baker, Kovelman,
Bialystok & Petitto, 2003; Bialystok & Martin, 2004;
Bialystok & Viswanathan, 2009) and in particular to the
DCCS task (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok & Martin, 2004;
Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008; Kalashnikova & Mattock,
2014; Okanda et al., 2010). The idea here is that similar to
bilingual language processing demands, a large bilingual
effect can be found in tasks that require multiple cognitive
processes working in tandem with one another. Indeed, a
recent discussion article by Bialystok (2017) purports the
idea that dimensional shifting requires the integration of
multiple EF constructs for task success, such as flexibility,
switching, and monitoring. The current findings support
the conjecture that bilingual experiences may be shown
broadly within the general executive control system (e.g.,
inhibition, shifting, and updating), with recent extensions
in working memory processes in older children (Morales,
Calvo & Bialystok, 2013; Soliman, 2014; Tran & Yoshida,
2012) and adults (Bialystok, Poarch, Luo & Craik,
2014). The present findings complement the potential
global nature of bilingual cognitive advantage when
specific factors such as SES, vocabulary knowledge, and
bilingual language characteristics are carefully controlled
for (Bialystok, Craik & Luk, 2008; Bialystok, 2017).
Moreover, the smaller effect of bilingualism found
in the Day/Night and Gift Delay tasks may point to
the importance of understanding the graded levels on
response inhibition task demands. Early practices of
behavioral regulation, commonly found with individuals
from Eastern cultural backgrounds, may support better
performance in response inhibition (than those from
non-Eastern cultural backgrounds). In comparison to
dimensional shifting, response inhibition does not require
multiple cognitive processes (i.e., less cognitive load)
for successful performance. Although EF processes are
highly interrelated and may be differentially influenced by
the level of cognitive demand required for successful task
performance, different EF tasks tap into different internal
cognitive mechanisms, which in turn will vary how
individual processes are influenced by either bilingualism

Culture and bilingualism on executive function
or culture (Miyake, Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, Howerter
& Wager, 2000; Garon, Bryson & Smith, 2008; Best &
Miller, 2010). Such could explain the mixed findings on
whether bilinguals perform better than monolinguals in
response inhibition tasks (Barac, Moreno & Bialystok,
2016; Bonifacci, Giombini, Bellocchi & Contento, 2011;
Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008; Engel de Abreu, Cruz-Santos,
Tourinho, Martin & Bialystok, 2012; Esposito, BakerWard & Mueller, 2013; Martin-Rhee & Bialystok, 2008).
Task-specific effect of cross-cultural differences
To address the limitation regarding the lack of systematic
investigation of cultural influences on the bilingual
cognitive advantage, the present study included three
monolingual groups in the United States, Argentina, and
Vietnam that differ in the degree of collectivism, and three
bilingual groups in the United States and Vietnam. In the
present study, children from Eastern and Latin American
cultures outperformed children from Western culture in
verbal response inhibition, which measures the ability to
inhibit their prepotent response (Diamond, Kirkham &
Amso, 2002; Gerstadt et al., 1994; McAuley, Christ &
White, 2011; Montgomery & Fosco, 2012; Simpson &
Riggs, 2005). We speculate that the task demands are
reminiscent to the shared collectivistic qualities found
in Eastern and Latin American cultures where societies
emphasize the importance of early impulse control and
self-regulating responses (Tobin et al., 1989; Ho, 1994;
Wu, 1996; Chen et al., 1998; Parmar, Harkness &
Super, 2004; Oh & Lewis, 2008). Also, children with
Eastern cultural influences, regardless of language status,
outperformed those in Latin American culture (bilingual
Spanish-English), thereby suggesting that response
inhibition processes may be more sensitive to "tightly
integrated" collectivistic qualities. Although those in
Latin American culture share collectivistic qualities with
those in Eastern cultures, they are considered more
loose-structured due to the influences of individualism.
Furthermore, the lack of differences in verbal response
inhibition among the Vietnamese groups further
demonstrates that success may be heavily influenced by
the cultural structure among the shared groups.
Contrary to the present hypothesis, performance
on motor response inhibition did not demonstrate any
systematic differences between cultural groups. This
finding suggests that cognitive processes involved in
motor response inhibition, but not verbal response
inhibition (e.g., Day/Night), may not be directly affected
by cultural background experiences. Although these tasks
require response inhibition, it differs in the modality
involved (hand/body motor movement vs. speech motor
movement) and therefore may be differentially affected
by language status and cultural background. In particular,
the Day/Night task involves verbal response inhibition

727

that may be more pertinent in Eastern cultural practices
of self-regulating responses in front of authority figures
(Oh & Lewis, 2008).
Furthermore, the use of puppets in the Bear/Dragon
task (versus cards in the Day/Night task) may play a
role in the lack of influence. In particular, recent research
demonstrates that cognitive performances among 3- to 5year-old children improve when they are introduced to a
doll or a puppet during task administration (Moriguchi,
Sakata, Ishibashi & Ishikawa, 2015). The idea is that
children improve their self-regulatory behaviors through
interpersonal interaction, tools that aid attention and
memory, and engagements in pretend play (Lillard & ElseQuest, 2006; Vygotsky 1962, 1967). Thus, task specifics
and administration are important factors to consider when
analyzing task results. However, more research needs to be
further carried out to fully examine the effect of different
modalities and task administration on the level of required
response inhibition. Thus, these results highlight the tasksensitive nature of the processes involved when examining
the bilingual and cultural effect on cognitive performance.
The interaction effect between culture and bilingualism
Perhaps an interesting aspect of the present study is the
significant interaction effect of bilingualism and culture
on measures of verbal response inhibition. A closer
look into the analyses demonstrates that Vietnamese
bilingual children (Vietnamese-English and Vietnamese-
Cantonese) outperformed monolinguals from the U.S. and
Argentina, but not in Vietnam. This supports the idea that
processes related to response inhibition may be highly
influenced by the cultural structure (collectivism) and may
be further enhanced when bilingual groups are coupled to
promote a more GENERAL EF capacity (Yang et al., 2011).
In particular, previous studies demonstrating the
lack of differences between monolingual and bilingual
children on response inhibition tasks did not include
and/or report children with Eastern cultural influences in
their design (Barac et al., 2016; Bonifacci et al., 2011;
Carlson & Meltzoff, 2008; Engel de Abreu et al., 2012;
Esposito et al., 2013; Martin-Rhee & Bialystok, 2008).
As shown in the current study, the Eastern cultural factor
displayed the largest effect on task performance, with
language status (bilingualism) showing a smaller effect
(see Figure 2). As such, the enhanced interaction effect of
bilingualism and culture may be more unique to Eastern
cultural groups that place emphasis on early behavioral
regulation and impulse control.
Addressing discrepancies in culture and bilingual
literature and limitations
Culture permeates various aspects of learning -
interpersonal reactions of children, testers, teachers,

728

families, the physical layout where they are tested, and
language. It is difficult to guarantee that everything is
identical in every way, which is an interesting yet complex
issue in cross-cultural research. In the present study, we
made every effort to ensure tasks were appropriate in these
diverse cultures. There are no a-priori or post-hoc reasons
to believe that the uncontrolled differences contributed
directly to the pattern of results independent of the larger
differences in culture. Indeed, cross-cultural studies are
never guaranteed to be bias-free (van de Vijver & Tanzer,
2004; He & van de Vijver, 2012). We further recognize
that a number of social and cultural factors seemingly
unrelated to such variables may influence performance on
the Day/Night task. The social and cultural factor includes,
but may not be limited to, familiarity with the sun/moon
depictions, practice on delaying gratification, and/or other
inhibitory skills. Therefore, the attribution to the specific
cultural trait of collectivism/individualism needs further
investigation and specific testing to examine differences in
cultural traits that vary as they integrate with bilingualism.
Moreover, although general linear mixed model analyses
effectively address the growth and maximum likelihood of
the small sample size and longitudinal design (Sui, Fouladi
& Shieh, 2002) in the present study, future research should
extend our populations controlling for factors that may
affect task performance. Nonetheless, the current attempt
in controlling for relevant factors while capturing the
changes of cognitive capacity in a longitudinal design
is significant for optimizing systematic comparisons
between individuals with different cultural and language
learning experiences.
In sum, the present multi-site longitudinal design
reveals the impact in task-specific and global nature
of cognitive advantages associated with bilingualism,
culture, and combined effects when different EF processes
and developmental periods are considered. Such complex
dynamics may not only explain diverse findings regarding
how experiences from different language learning and
cultural environments influence EF task performances,
but also shed light on the potential mechanisms underlying
the individual differences in cognitive development.
