Abstract An event-related potential experiment was conducted in order to investigate readers' response to violations in the hierarchical structure of functional categories in Japanese,
an agglutinative language where functional heads like Negation (Neg) as well as Tense (Tns)
are realized as suffixes. A left-lateralized negativity followed by a P600 was elicited for the
anomaly of attaching a Neg morpheme outside a Tns-marking suffix (i.e., syntactic violation
of the form *[[V - Tns] - Neg]), while only P600 was observed for the anomalous form
with a purely morphological/morpho-phonological violation, i.e., a Neg morpheme attached
to ren'yo form instead of Neg-selecting form. The findings suggest that the syntactic structure involving Tns and Neg in Japanese, realized within a word as a sequence of suffixes,
is processed in a similar manner to the syntactic structures that are phrasally realized in
well-studied European languages like English.

Introduction
The present study reports event-related potential (ERP) responses to two different types of
violations in Japanese verb conjugation patterns. More specifically, we compared responses
to violations in the hierarchical structure of functional categories with those to purely
morphological/morpho-phonological errors in the processing of Japanese verb conjugation.

In this study, we focus on the functional heads Tense (Tns) and Negation (Neg) as realized
as part of conjugation pattern in Japanese.1 In recent works on syntax it has been observed
and claimed that the ordering of verbal functional heads expressing tense, modality, aspect
and voice is fixed within a language and also cross-linguistically regardless of their position
(i.e. left or right) to the verb (Cinque 1999 and others). Thus, in this so-called "cartographic"
approach, where each functional element constitutes the head of a phrase, the ordering of the
functional heads defines a universal hierarchical structure. Furthermore, it has been noted
that there may be some parametric variations on the position of Neg with respect to Tns
(Cinque 1999:125); in some languages Tns appears higher than Neg, while the reverse order
is employed in others. Japanese belongs to the latter type, with Tns placed higher than Neg.
Since Japanese is a head-final language, the structure assumed is as shown in (1).

What is crucial for our experiment is that in Japanese both Tns and Neg appearing with VP
in the syntactic structure (1) are realized as verbal suffixes, while Neg can be realized with
an independent free morpheme (e.g. a particle or a clitic) in some languages such as English.
Thus, in Japanese the verb combines with these functional heads through head movement (as
represented by the arrows in (1)) with the morpheme order [V-Neg-Tns]. By reversing the
order of Neg and Tns suffixes, it is possible to create a case of violation in the hierarchical
structure within a word unit, as will be presented in "Stimuli and Prediction" section. Thus
the present study aims at observing ERP responses to syntactic anomalies realized at the
word-level, comparing them with those to a purely morphological (or morpho-phonological)
anomalies, exploiting the agglutinative nature of Japanese.
In preceding ERP studies on syntactic anomalies, so-called phrase structure violations
have been the focus of research: more specifically, they used word-category violations to
study the ERP responses to syntactic violations, like a preposition followed by a verb (e.g.,
*zur veredelt (Ger) `for refined'; Friederici et al. 1996) or a possessive noun followed by
a preposition (e.g., *Max's of proof the theorem; Neville et al. 1991). Many of them report
two ERP components (E)LAN and P600. The (E)LAN ((Early) Left Anterior Negativity),2 a
negativity observed around 150-400 ms after the onset of stimuli with distribution restricted
to left anterior sites, is reported for phrase structure violations in various languages including
English (Neville et al. 1991; Munte et al. 1993), German (Friederici et al. 1996; Gunter et al.
1999), Dutch (Hagoort et al. 2003), and Spanish (Hinojosa et al. 2003). The P600, a positivity
observed at around 600 ms after the onset of stimuli, is also reported for phrase structure
violations in various languages including English (Neville et al. 1991), German (Friederici
et al. 1996; Gunter et al. 1999), Dutch (Hagoort et al. 1993, 2003), and Spanish (Hinojosa
et al. 2003). In many studies on phrase structure violations, both of these two components are

2 An influential model of sentence processing proposed by Friederici (2002) distinguishes ELAN (150-

200 ms) and LAN (300-500 ms), claiming that the former reflects the stage of sentence processing including
syntactic structure building, but the distinction between these two components is under debate (Friederici and
Wiessenborn 2007). We do not go into this issue for space considerations.

observed constituting a biphasic pattern (Neville et al. 1991; Friederici et al. 1996; Gunter
et al. 1999; Hagoort et al. 2003; Hinojosa et al. 2003), though some studies report only
negativities (Munte et al. 1993) or only positivities (Hagoort et al. 1993).
The types of violations discussed in the literature as summarized above and the violations
dealt with in this study can both be categorized as syntactic violations, and yet we should
note that they are different in two respects. First, the phrase structure violations discussed in
the literature can be regarded as a case of mis-selection of the word category of a complement
by the lexical head (e.g., the complement of P cannot be V, etc.), while the syntactic violation
examined in the current study involves reversal of hierarchical positions of functional heads.
Secondly, as noted above, the functional category violations in question are realized as wrong
order of verbal suffixes in Japanese, so that the syntactic violations are realized within a word,
unlike in the previous studies in which syntactic violations are phrasally realized. In these
respects, our study offers ERP data concerning a new type of syntactic violation hitherto
unexamined in the ERP literature: if the results we obtain are similar to those reported for
phrase structure violations in previous studies, then we may conclude that the observed
ERP components reflect the "syntactic" nature of the relevant violations, irrespective of the
differences noted above.

Stimuli and Predictions
Japanese verbs can be classified into two morphological types: one with a vowel-ending
root (henceforth V-verbs), and the other with a consonant-ending root (C-verbs). This study
utilizes C-verbs, because this class of verbs allow us to construct minimal pairs of illicit
negation forms as will be presented below, which is not possible with V-verbs. The following
are the conjugation patterns that are relevant to this study:

Three vowels -u, -a, and -i, appear after the root under the following different conditions.
First, -u in (2a) is a non-past or present Tns morpheme (Prs). On the other hand, -a in (2b)
and -i in (2c) can be regarded as epenthetic vowels (glossed as -a and -i, respectively).3
The vowel -a is inserted before Neg (i.e. -na and other Neg suffixes), while the insertion of
the vowel -i forms the so-called ren'yo form of the verb, which can be followed by various
predicates like-mas `polite form ending' or owar- `finish'.
A set of stimuli with conjugation errors was constructed to be compared with their correct
counterparts. They consisted of the correct negation form (3a) and two different types of illicit
negation form of C-verbs (3b, c): ren'yo form precedes the Neg morpheme-na in (3b), and
the non-past Tns morpheme -u intervenes the root and the Neg morpheme in (3c), thereby
constituting minimal triplets with the same number of moras. All the stimuli end with the nonpast form of the Neg morpheme (na-i): the Neg morpheme exhibits adjectival conjugation
pattern, where the non-past Tns suffix is -i.
3 The exact nature of the vowels -a in Neg-selecting form (2b) and -i in ren'yo form (2c) is under debate.

Some researchers regard both of them as epenthetic vowels inserted in specific morphological contexts (Tagawa
2012), while others treat them differently: for instance, Nishiyama (2016) analyzes -ana in (2b) as a single
morpheme, which is an allomorph of -na `Neg', while -i in (2c) as an epenthetic vowel in some usages and as
an independent morpheme (i.e., infinitive marker) in other usages.

It should be noted that the two illicit forms have different types of anomaly. (3b) has a simple
morphological ill-formedness, where a wrong conjugation form (i.e., ren'yo form instead
of Neg-selecting form) is chosen. Or, put differently, it involves a wrong selection of an
epenthetic vowel, which may be regarded as a purely morpho-phonological error.4 On the
other hand, (3c) involves an error in the hierarchical structure of functional heads as shown in
(4) below: the non-past Tns morpheme (-u) is added below the Neg morpheme -na, in contrast
with the correct configuration of Neg above Tns, as in (1) above. Since the suffixal functional
heads Tns -u and Neg -na are both combined with the verb root via head movement, (3c)
constitutes a word-internal syntactic violation.5,6

Consequently, based on the findings in the past ERP studies surveyed above, we can
predict that (3c) with a violation in syntactic structure will elicit a LAN and/or P600 when
compared with the well-formed counterparts. On the other hand, if the LAN (and/or P600) is
not sensitive to purely morphological/morpho-phonological violations, we can predict that
(3b) will not elicit a LAN (and/or P600).

Method
Materials
The target sentences were created on 90 C-verbs. We constructed triplet sentences with the
correct form and two types of illicit forms as exemplified in (5) below.
4 In the alternative analysis mentioned in Note 3, where the Neg morpheme is realized as -ana rather than -na

(Nishiyama 2016), the violation involves the wrong form (-ina) for the Neg suffix. This arguably would also
constitute a morphological error.
5 A reviewer has pointed out that the parser could have parsed the examples like (3c) as two words rather
than one, since the non-past morpheme -u generally marks the end of a word, in which case our syntactic
violation is regarded to be realized at the phrasal level rather than the word level. While it is true that Tns
in general marks the end of a word, Neg in the verbal domain must attach as a suffix to the preceding verb:
thus there is good reason to believe that the parser treated examples like (3c) as one word. Furthermore,
the stimuli were presented bunsetu-by-bunsetu, where each bunsetu consisted of one independent word (plus
dependent functional elements like case markers) (see Procedures in the "Method" section), so that it is unlikely
that the participants analyzed only (3c) as two independent words. These considerations, however, may not
completely dispell the reviewer's concern: one way to solve the problem is to design a similar experiment
with oral presentation of stimuli, where the accent pattern can force "one word" interpretation of examples
like (3c), which we would like to leave for a future study.
6 Strictly speaking, the illicit example (3c) may be interpreted to have two non-past tense morphemes, moyasu-na-i (burn-Prs-Neg-Prs), so that the violation involves not merely the reversal of the hierarchical relation
between Tns and Neg, but also doubling of Tns positions. This could also be considered as a case of syntactic
violation in hierarchical structure involving functional categories.

All sentences used in this experiment had the structure [NP-adjunct-NP-V-X] (see
"Appendix 1" section for the full set of target items). An additional element X, nominal
+ copula or Auxiliary predicate, was added after the verb where we manipulated the conjugation, so that the sentences do not end with the critical word. Three lists were created
according to a Latin square design, so that each list contained 30 sentences in each of the
three conditions. One participant saw only one condition for each sentence. A total of 252
sentences, 90 target and 162 filler sentences, were presented. Half of these sentences were
well-formed. The 252 sentences were divided into 3 blocks, and within the blocks, sentences
were randomized.

Participants
Twenty-one Japanese undergraduate students of the University of Tokyo (15 males and 6
females; age range 19-24; mean 20.20 years) were paid to participate in the experiment after
providing informed consent. All were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Subjects Research
of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the University of Tokyo.

Procedures
Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded while the participants read to themselves
the stimulus sentences shown automatically on the PC screen bunsetu by bunsetu (i.e., a lexical
word with functional morpheme(s) attached). Each sentence had 5 phrases, and each phrase
appeared on the screen for 600 ms with a 200 ms blank between each phrase. The critical
word, i.e., the verb in all conditions, is the fourth phrase in the stimulus sentences. Following
the presentation of each sentence, the participants were instructed to make a grammaticality
judgment (yes/no decision) by clicking a computer mouse. They were asked to refrain from
blinking their eyes or moving their bodies until the end of the sentences. They took a short
break between 3 blocks of the sentences.
EEG signals were recorded from 60 Ag/AgCl electrodes mounted in an elastic cap
(Quikcap, NeuroScan, Compumedics, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA) according to the
International 10-20 system. To control the participants' horizontal and vertical eye movements, a bipolar electrooculogram (EOG) was also recorded using four electrodes. All
the EEG and EOG channels were digitized at a 250 Hz sampling rate using a Neuroscan
SynAmps2 Amplifier with a band-pass between DC and 70 Hz. Recordings were referenced

to the electrode located between Cz and CPz and then re-referenced offline to the average of
the left and right mastoids. Electrode impedance was kept below 10 k. ERP averages were
computed with a 100 ms baseline and an 800 ms ERP time window. In the ERP analysis,
9.19% of the trials were rejected because of eye blinks or movement artifacts (the EOG
rejection criterion was 70 V). The average percentage of rejected trials was 9.1%.

Results
Performance was very good (> 99% correct response rates for each condition) and there was
no significant difference in correct response rates among correct form (5a), ren'yo form (5b),
and non-past form (5c) conditions.
Responses by participants showing high rates of artifacts (> 20%; 6 participants) were
excluded from the analysis, with 15 participants remaining (11 males and 4 females), and
only the responses with correct yes/no responses were analyzed.
Figure 1 shows the grand average ERPs for the critical verb, in correct form (5a), ren'yo
form (5b), and non-past form (5c) conditions.
Visual inspection showed that the ren'yo form (5b) elicited only a positive component,
while the non-past form (5c) both a negative and a positive components compared with
the correct form (5a). The negativity for the non-past form (5c) had its focus in a limited
area of the peripheral left temporal area. On the basis of this observation, the following
two regions of interest (ROIs) were used in the analyses of variance (ANOVA) for the leftlateralized negativity: left-temporal (T7, C5, CP5, and P7) and right-temporal (TP8, C6, CP6,
and P8). The ANOVA included the factors of condition (correct form vs. non-past form) and
hemisphere (left vs. right). For the analysis of the positivities in the ren'yo form (5b) and the
non-past form (5c) compared with the correct forms (5a), we chose the following lateral ROIs
on the basis of hemisphere (left/right) and region (anterior/posterior), left-anterior (F5, F3,
F1, FC5, FC3, FC1, C5, C3, and C1); left-posterior (CP5, CP3, CP1, P5, P3, P1, PO7, PO5,
and PO3); right-anterior (F2, F4, F6, FC2, FC4, FC6, C2, C4, and C6); and right-posterior
(CP6, CP4, CP2, P6, P4, P2, PO8, PO6, and PO4). The ANOVA included the factors of
condition (correct form vs. ren'yo or non-past form), hemisphere (left vs. right), and region
(anterior vs. posterior).
As shown in Fig. 1, a positivity around 500-800 ms after the onset was elicited by the
ren'yo form condition, in comparison with the correct form condition. The latency and the
distribution suggest that it is a P600 component, which is supported by the statistical analysis
as follows: the analyses for the time window 500-800 ms revealed a significant main effect of
conditions (F(1,14) = 21.98, p < .001). The ren'yo form condition was more positive-going
than the correct form condition. No other ERP components besides the P600 were observed
in the comparison of the correct form and the ren'yo form conditions ( ps>.05).
The non-past form condition, when compared with the correct form condition, elicited a
negativity in the left temporal region at the time range of 300-400 ms and a positivity around
500-800 ms. The analyses for the time window 300-400 ms revealed a significant interaction between hemispheres and conditions (F(1,14) = 4.54, p < .05). The non-past form
condition was more negative-going than the correct form condition in the left-temporal sites
(F(1,14) = 3.76, p = .066), but not in the right-temporal sites. The latency and the distribution
of the positivity suggest that it is a P600 component, which is supported by the statistical
analysis as follows: the analyses for the time window 500-800 ms revealed a significant

Discussion
The negativity was observed for the non-past form condition (5c: *moyas-u-na-i), but not for
the ren'yo form condition (5b: *moyas-i-na-i), in comparison to the well-formed counterparts.
Furthermore, the negativity elicited by the illicit non-past forms (5c) in comparison with the
well-formed control (5a) has clearly different distribution from the classic N400 component,
in that it was limited to the left hemisphere, as supported by the significant difference between
the two hemispheres. More precisely, though its distribution is also different from the classic
LAN component in that its focus is in the temporal sites, it is similar in distribution to a

left-lateralized negative component reported as a LAN by Rodriguez-Fornells et al. (2001)
for the violation of stem formation rule in Catalan.
This left-lateralized negativity can be interpreted as reflecting the parser's detection of
a syntactic violation of (5c), where the Tns morpheme is placed below the Neg node
as shown in (4) above. It is consistent with our prediction that there will be a difference concerning negative components between the illicit ren'yo forms (5b) and the illicit
non-past forms (5c). As mentioned earlier, the anomaly in (5b) is a purely morphological
(or morpho-phonological) error, while that in (5c) involves a syntactic violation concerning hierarchical structure of functional categories. Hence, it is plausible to consider that
this difference in the nature of anomaly led to the difference in negativities. This may
seem to be partially incompatible with some findings of previous studies, where not only
phrase structure violations but also violations in verb morphology like agreement errors
are reported to elicit the LAN component (Coulson et al. 1998, among others). It should
be noted, however, that the morphological error in (5b) is different in nature from those
morpho-syntactic errors: namely, LAN-eliciting morphological anomalies like agreement
errors necessarily involve computation of syntactic relations like subject-verb or verb-object
relations, which is not the case with (5b), where the violation (i.e., a wrong selection of an
epenthetic vowel or a wrong form of allomorph (see Note 4)) is purely morphological in
nature.
In addition, we observed late positive components, which can be judged to be a P600,
in both of the illicit conditions (ren'yo form (5b) and non-past form (5c)) when compared with the well-formed counterparts. Although the two conditions involve different
types of anomaly as discussed above, the elicitation of a P600 in both conditions suggests that this component reflects the cost of dealing with conjugation errors, irrespective
of their nature, namely, whether purely morphological (5b), or syntactic as in the case of
(5c).
Thus the illicit non-past forms exhibited the biphasic pattern of the left-lateralized negativity followed by a P600, which is in accordance with the literature reporting a LAN-P600
pattern for syntactic violations as surveyed in Introduction. It should be recalled, however,
that our findings are not a mere replication of the previous works, since our syntactic violations are different from those examined in the previous studies as summarized in Introduction
(i.e., they are not word-category violations, and are realized within a word). Furthermore, in
the case of word-category violations in previous studies, the parser can make a very strong
prediction on what to expect at the critical region. For instance, after a preposition or a possessive noun, a noun (or some element that can precede a noun) is strongly anticipated, and
so the response to the illicit continuation in these violations can be a result of the unattested
expectation. In fact, Mehravari et al. (2015) suggest the possibility that the P600 in grammatical violation displays larger amplitudes when the unattested expectation is stronger. Such
an explanation does not hold in our stimuli that elicited P600: in (5b, c), before encountering
the critical verb, the parser can only predict that some form of a transitive verb will follow
(since it has already encountered an Accusative-case-marked NP), which prediction is met
by the following word, namely, a transitive verb, albeit with conjugation errors. In sum, our
stimuli are different in these respects from the syntactic violations examined in the previous literature, and yet exhibited very similar ERP responses, which provides support to our
contention that the common feature of being a syntactic violation has yielded the observed
biphasic pattern.
To sum up, in an ERP experiment on Japanese verb conjugation errors, syntactic violations in the hierarchical structure of functional categories (i.e., *[[V - Tns] - Neg]) elicited
a left-lateralized negativity followed by a P600 in comparison to the correct counterparts,

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2018) 47:215-240

223

while morphological/morpho-phonological errors of inserting wrong vowels elicited no negative component but only a P600. Our findings offer a new perspective to ERP studies
of syntactic violations in that the type of violations dealt with in this study is different
from those examined in the ERP literature in two respects: first, it involves a reversed
hierarchical order rather than word category violations, and second, it is realized within
a word, in contrast to the phrasally realized violations so far studied in previous work. If
the biphasic pattern observed in our study can be regarded as the same as those reported for
phrase structure violations in other studies, then it strongly suggests that the processing of
structure building employs the same mechanism either at the word level or at the phrasal
level.
