a b s t r a c t
Converging evidence from behavioral masked priming (Rastle & Davis, 2008), EEG masked priming (Morris, Frank, Grainger, & Holcomb, 2007) and single word MEG (Zweig & Pylkkanen, 2008) experiments has
provided robust support for a model of lexical processing which includes an early, automatic, visual word
form based stage of morphological parsing that applies to all derivationally affixed words. The mechanisms by which regularly (walked, birds) and irregularly (gave, geese) inflected forms are processed are
less well established. We combine the masked priming paradigm with EEG recording to directly compare
the ERPs evoked by regularly and irregularly inflected forms. We find equivalent N250 priming effects for
both types of morphological complexity, which argues for rapid, form based morphological parsing of all
morphologically complex word forms.

1. Introduction
The question of how words like teacher and walked are parsed
and recognized has been debated for more than 30 years (Rastle
& Davis, 2008; Stockall & Marantz, 2006; Taft & Forster, 1975).
On the one hand, these words can easily be parsed into a stem
and affix, each of which makes a transparent, predictable contribution to the meaning and grammatical function of the whole word,
and each of which is robustly attested in many other forms in the
language. These facts motivate models such as that of Taft and Forster (1975); Taft (2004) or Stockall and Marantz (2006), that include an early, form based, affix-stripping mechanism that
precedes and feeds into subsequent activation of stored lexical
stems. On the other hand, words like teacher are familiar and frequently heard, read and produced, and many words that can be
formally parsed into a stem and affix are not so obviously transparent semantically (a folder is not usually understood as `a person
who folds'). These facts have motivated a range of models without
early, form based decomposition, in which complex familiar words
are stored whole in the lexicon (Albright & Hayes, 2003; Butterworth, 1983) or recognized via associative networks with no morphological units at all (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986, chap. 18).
A second, related question is how words like sang or geese, that
do not follow the regular morphological patterns of the language,
are parsed and stored. Models that do not include decomposition
for regular allomorphy also, obviously, do not assume decomposition for irregulars. The same form and meaning similarity based

associations that link walk with its relatives walked, walking, and
walkable link sing with its relatives sang, singing, singer in these
models (Devlin, Jamison, Matthews, & Gonnerman, 2004; Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986, chap. 18; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989).
By contrast, models that assume rule based decomposition for
regulars are split between those, such as the extremely influential
Words & Rules model (Pinker & Prince (1988, chap. II) inter alia)
that adopt the whole word storage + similarity associations model
for irregulars, and those that extend the rule based approach to
generate irregulars as well (Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Halle & Marantz, 1994; Stockall & Marantz, 2006; Yang, 2002).
These latter models posit `full, across the board, decomposition'
(Stockall & Marantz, 2006), with no categorical differences between regular and irregular allomorphy, or between concatenative
(affixal) and non-concatenative morphology. The rules in (1 and 2)
show how Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz, 1994) would
account for `sold', `sang' and `slept'. In (1), we have the fragment of
grammar that generates the three possible allomorphs of the English past tense morpheme. The abstract past tense morpheme T past
can be realized in any of three ways: ;,/t/, or /d/. The first two options are restricted to a small set of roots, which are listed with the
irregular allomorph, while the/d/ option is freely available and applies to any root that does not appear on one of the memorized
lists.

The rules in (1) are sufficient to account for all regular past tense
forms and for all zero-change forms (hit, cut), which simply take

82

the null allomorph of the past tense, rather than the default/d/.
Forms like sang or sold require additional stem vowel adjustment
rules such as the rule in (2-a), which maps the high front vowel/I/
to the low front vowel/ae/ in stems like sing and swim, when those
stems occur together with the past tense morpheme.

c: . . .
Thus the irregular past tense
pffiffiffiffiffiffiffi form sold is hypothesized to be generated from the verb root sell + the regular/d/ allomorph of the past
tense + a morpho-phonological adjustment rule that
maps/e/ ? /o/.
pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
The irregular past tense sang, is generated from sing + the null
allomorph
of the past tense + the rule /I/ ? /ae/, and irregular slept
pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
from sleep + the/t/ allomorph of the past tense + the rule /i/ ? /
e/.
The models proposed by Yang (2002) and Stockall and Marantz
(2006) use slightly different formalisms that account for the variation in the realization of the past tense morpheme and the stem
allomorphy across the 170 irregular roots in slightly different
ways, but the critical core claim shared by all these theories is that
processing
the letter string `taught' involves activating the root
pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
teach, and that this activation is the result of successfully recognizing the surface [Ot] sound (or aught letter string) as the output of
a rule that operates over underlying/itS/ sequences.
The prediction of these models, then, is that the early word form
recognition processes must be sensitive not just to the patterns
associated with regular allomorphy, but also to those associated
with irregular allomorphy. The work of Albright (2002) and Albright and Hayes (2003) on `islands of reliability' in the irregular allomorphy of English and Italian suggests that this claim is not as
unlikely as it might otherwise seem. They show that speakers are
sensitive to even subtle stochastic subregularities in the morphological patterning of their language. For example, although the
stem/past tense alternation found in bleed  bled, lead  led,
feed  fed, read  read, and breed  bred is certainly irregular (only
a small set of stems participate in the alternation), it is actually
highly reliable (by Albright and Hayes' counts, 6/7 stems ending
in eed have past tense allomorphs that rhyme with bled). This high
degree of consistency in even irregular allomorphy means the pattern recognition system responsible for initial form based decomposition (discussed in detail below) could plausibly detect
possible irregular morphemes as well as regular. Given that ablaut
and similar morphologically conditioned stem alternations are
widely attested across the world's languages, it would not be surprising for an early, word form based, morphological parsing
mechanism to be capable of detecting this kind of pattern.
The experiment reported here addresses both the general issue
of whether regular morphological inflection is rapidly detected by
the same early, morpho-orthographic parsing mechanisms that
have been argued to operate over derivational affixes, and the
more specific question of whether irregular allomorphy is also
parsed by these same mechanisms, by combining the behavioral
masked priming + lexical decision paradigm with EEG recordings.
1.1. Behavioral masked morphological priming
In the masked priming paradigm, a prime is visually presented
for only 30-50 ms and the prime is masked by the prior presentation of a masking stimulus, typically a series of hash marks
(#####) or random consonant strings (SDFGHJK). The prime is
either immediately followed by another mask or by the target
which serves as a backward mask. The short prime duration, as
well as the presence of the forward (and backward) mask, prevents
the subject from consciously perceiving the prime. Moreover, the

close temporal proximity of the prime and target allows little time
for the prime to be processed in isolation from the target, and thus
any effects of the prime on responses to the target are presumed to
reflect early automatic lexical processes rather than strategic and/
or episodic memory effects (Forster & Davis, 1984). When primes
are fully visible to the subject, it is unclear whether the priming effects observed are the result of automatic lexical processes, (e.g.
activation of a lexical entry) or the result of an episodic memory
of the prime influencing the decision process. Such priming studies
are also vulnerable to the use of predictive strategies by subjects if
the relationship between prime-target pairs becomes obvious
(Feustel, Shiffrin, & Salasoo, 1983; Jacoby, 1983). These concerns
can be mitigated with the use of a masked prime (Forster & Davis,
1984). The classic finding using this paradigm is faster responses
for target words preceded by identical or similar prime words
when compared to primes that are unrelated to the target.
Feldman, O'Connor, and Del Prado Martin (2009) and Rastle and
Davis (2008) both provide an overview of the recent literature
using this paradigm to investigate morphological complexity. The
core finding is that when a masked prime word is related to the
target by a possible morpho-orthographic relationship, lexical
decision times to the target are significantly faster than when the
same target is preceded by an unrelated prime. This result is nicely
captured in the title of Rastle, Davis, and New (2004)'s paper: ``The
broth in my brother's brothel: Morpho-orthographic segmentation
in visual word recognition''. This title derives from the key comparison between a prime target pair like brother  broth, in which the
prime can plausibly be decomposed into a stem `broth' and a familiar suffix `-er', and a prime target pair like brothel  broth, in which
the prime can not be decomposed, because `-el' is not an attested
suffix in English. Rastle et al. find that pseudo-complex primes
such as brother and adder significantly facilitate lexical decision
reaction times to their pseudo-stem targets (broth, add), while
primes which contain the target as an orthographic substring,
but do not contain an existing affix (brothel, addict) are not associated with any such facilitation.
Starting with the work of Rastle, Davis, Marslen-Wilson, and Tyler (2000), at least 20 experiments using the masked priming paradigm to compare real and pseudo/opaque derivational
morphology have been published. The consensus of this literature
using masked priming and the behavioral lexical decision task to
investigate morphological complexity is strong support for a model
in which there is an early, automatic, obligatory, visual word form
based stage of morpho-orthographic segmentation in which all possible affixes are stripped from their stems (Rastle & Davis, 2008).
There is debate within this literature about whether this earliest
stage of morphological processing is purely word form based (Rastle
& Davis, 2008) or may involve lexical-semantic factors (Feldman
et al., 2009). Feldman et al. (2009)'s review of the literature finds that
across the 18 experiments they survey, genuinely morphologically
related primes are, on average, associated with greater facilitation
effects than pseudo-related primes. They argue that this means that
the semantic overlap between morphological relatives must be
playing a role at the earliest stages of processing, and thus that the
early segmentation is not purely form based. However, an explanation for differences in prime magnitude can also be found in stem:whole word transition probabilities (Hay, 2001), which are a purely
word form based measure. Stem:whole word transition probabilities are calculated as the ratio of the stem frequency to the whole
word frequency. For transparently complex words like taxable or
teacher, the probability of the whole word given the stem (tax or
teach) is fairly low: tax and teach occur as whole words on their
own, and in combination with many other derivational and inflectional morphemes. Conversely, for pseudo-complex words like
brother, the probability of the whole word given the stem is very
high: broth is a low frequency word itself, and this stem occurs in

J. Morris, L. Stockall / Brain & Language 123 (2012) 81-93

no common derived or inflected words. Thus the transitional probability from the (putative) stem to the whole word is an excellent index of the probability that the whole word is morphologically
complex. The higher the stem/whole word transition probability,
the lower the likelihood that the whole word is inflected or derived
from the stem, and vice versa. Lewis, Solomyak, and Marantz (2011);
Lewis and Marantz (submitted for publication) (discussed in Section 1.3) show that these transition probabilities are, indeed, an
excellent predictor of early neural sensitivity to morphological complexity, and that no appeal to semantic factors is required to account
for differences in early processing responses between transparent
and opaque morphologically complex word forms.
1.2. Masked morphological priming from irregularly inflected primes
Meunier and Marslen-Wilson (2000) use the masked priming
paradigm to examine the representation of regular and irregular
verb forms in French. They find that regular and irregular verb
forms prime their infinitive forms equally, suggesting that they
are both represented in a single system, but this experiment did
not include an orthographic overlap condition, thus limiting the
conclusions that can be drawn. Other research investigating irregular allomorph priming with the masked priming paradigm (Kielar,
Joanisse, & Hare, 2008; Pastizzo & Feldman, 2002) provides additional evidence suggesting that at least some irregulars do prime
their stem targets, but the two studies come to conflicting conclusions about exactly which irregulars these are. Pastizzo and Feldman find priming for high overlap irregulars like gave  give, but
not for low overlap pairs like taught  teach, while Kielar et al. find
essentially the opposite pattern.
In an effort to resolve these conflicts, Crepaldi, Rastle, Coltheart,
and Nickels (2010) compared genuinely related irregular prime-target pairs like sold  sell and mice  mouse with pseudo-irregular pairs
like bold  bell and spice  spouse. Using the masked priming design,
Crepaldi et al. found that irregularly inflected primes significantly
facilitated reaction times to their targets, but that there was no facilitation for prime-target pairs where the prime and target were similar to one another in the same way as an existing irregular prime and
target, but had no plausible morphological relationship to one another (e.g. bold  bell). Crepaldi et al. did not directly compare regulars and irregulars. Their results, and the results of the other studies
reporting significant masked priming effects for irregular allomorph
primes, suggest that irregular allomorphs are very rapidly analyzed,
leading to rapid activation of their stem correlates, and thus facilitation in the masked priming paradigm. However, the lack of a pseudoirregular priming effect in the Crepaldi et al. experiments raises
doubts about whether irregulars are analyzed by the same morpho-orthographic mechanisms as regular allomorphs with overt,
segmentable affixes. Crepaldi et al. conclude that irregulars are not
segmented morpho-orthographically, and thus that regulars should
be associated with greater priming effects than irregulars.
By contrast, theories such as Albright and Hayes (2003), Halle
and Marantz (1994) and Stockall and Marantz (2006), make no
principled distinction between regular and irregular allomorphy,
even at the orthographic form level of representation. As discussed
above (Section 1), irregular verbs cluster into what Albright and
Hayes (2003) term `islands of reliability'. Given that many of the
past tense forms that exhibit these sub-regularities are themselves
highly frequent, and thus regularly encountered, these patterns are
predicted to be available to an early visual linguistic pattern recognition system.
1.3. Neural correlate of early, morpho-orthographic segmentation
Given the robust body of behavioral evidence for early, visual
word form based, morphological segmentation for affixed forms,

83

the question naturally arrises as to whether the visual word form
area/response identified by Cohen et al. (2000) as being the first
processing response specifically sensitive to linguistic word form
features in a number of languages (Lehtonen et al., 2007; McCandliss, Cohen, & Dehaene, 2003; Nakamura, Dehaene, Jobert, Le Bihan,
& Kouider, 2005; Tarkiainen, Cornelissen, & Salmelin, 2002) also
shows sensitivity to morpho-orthographic features.
Zweig and Pylkkanen (2008) addressed this question using a single word reading paradigm (no primes or masks) and a visual lexical
decision task. Zweig and Pylkkanen (2008) experiment 1 compared
three types of word stimuli: (a) transparently complex suffixed
forms like teacher (b) unsegmentable monomorphs such as stretch
and (c) forms with an -er ending, but that could not be plausibly segmented such as winter (there is no stem `wint'). Experiment 2 made
the same comparisons with prefixes: complex: refill vs. unsegmentable: throng vs. no-stem: resume. Zweig and Pylkkanen (2008) used
the Tailerach coordinates of the Visual Word Form Area as reported
in Cohen et al. (2000) to model the MEG activation. In both experiments, the forms that could be segmented into two discrete pieces
differed from those that could not: they evoked greater amplitudes
from the visual word form area response component peaking
approximately 170 ms after the onset of the visually presented
word. There were no differences between forms like winter or resume which contain a substring that could be an affix, but no plausible stem, and unsegmentable monomorphs like stretch or throng.
Zweig and Pylkkanen (2008) argue that this increased activation
for morphologically complex words indexes precisely the early
stage of visual word form based morphological segmentation argued
for from the behavioral masked morphological priming literature.
Solomyak and Marantz (2010); Lewis et al. (2011) and Lewis
and Marantz (submitted for publication), in a series of experiments
using distributed source modeling of the MEG signal evoked by
single words, have confirmed this finding that activity originating
in the fusiform gyrus is differentially sensitive to morphological
complexity. In these studies, Marantz and his colleagues find that
activity originating in the left fusiform gyrus and peaking between
140 and 190 ms after the onset of a visually presented word (the
M170 component) increases as a function of the decomposability
of that word, but is not modulated by semantic factors.
Lewis et al. (2011) and Lewis and Marantz (submitted for publication) show that the magnitude of the M170 response is, in fact,
highly correlated with the stem:whole word transition probability
of a potentially morphologically complex word. Words with low
transition probabilities (and thus high probability of being complex) are associated with greater M170 amplitudes than words
with higher TPs (lower probability of being complex). This purely
word form based measure predicts precisely the difference between teacher and brother reported by Feldman et al. (2009), with
no need to appeal to semantic factors.
The behavioral masked priming literature and MEG single word
reading literature, then, provide convergent, consistent evidence
supporting a model of visual lexical processing in which morphological constituents are very rapidly and automatically detected
on the basis of their orthographic form.
Interestingly however, research directly combining the masked
morphological priming paradigm with measurements of the
evoked neural correlates from EEG recordings, has so far produced
a less consistent picture.
Research combining masked repetition priming with EEG has
resulted in a clear pattern of evoked ERP components that can be
related to a well motivated functional architecture for word recognition (Grainger & Holcomb, 2009; Holcomb & Grainger, 2006,
2007). A series of ERP components, whose amplitudes are modulated by priming, appear to reflect processing that proceeds from
visual features to orthographic representations and finally to
meaning.

84

J. Morris, L. Stockall / Brain & Language 123 (2012) 81-93

The earliest of these components, the N/P150, is also the most
focal, producing priming effects that are visible only at the
most anterior and posterior sites primarily in the right hemisphere;
positive-going at occipital sites (especially over the right hemisphere) and negative-going at more anterior sites. This effect has
been observed across several studies using words (Holcomb &
Grainger, 2006), single letters (Petit, Midgley, Holcomb, & Grainger,
2006) and pictures of objects (Eddy, Schmid, & Holcomb, 2006).
Evidence that the N/P150 is modulated by such a diverse range of
stimuli, including non-linguistic stimuli, suggests that it reflects
an early, low level process, possibly one that is involved in mapping
visual features onto higher level representations (Holcomb &
Grainger, 2006). This component is, then, unlikely to be the ERP analog of the MEG M170/Visual Word Form component, and thus is not
expected to show the same sensitivity to morpho-orthographic
patterns.
The second component found to be sensitive to linguistic
processes operating in the masked priming paradigm is the N250
(Holcomb & Grainger, 2006). The N250 is a negative going wave
with an onset around 175 ms, a duration of approximately
150 ms and a peak at around 250 ms. It has a broad scalp distribution with the largest effects over the more frontal sites. It is larger,
and peaks earlier, to targets following primes with which they share
no letters than to targets that are partial repetitions of their primes,
while targets that are partial repetitions of their primes produce
larger N250s than full repetitions. (Holcomb & Grainger, 2006,
2007) suggest that the N250 may reflect the processing of sub-letter
visual feature representations and sub-word orthographic representations (i.e. letters and letter clusters). In particular, they
propose that the amplitude of the N250 may reflect the degree of
mismatch between letter and letter-cluster representations that
are activated by the prime stimulus, and those representations
receiving activation from the target. This component is the likeliest
to reflect the early VWFA processing indexed by the MEG M170.
Finally the third component implicated in masked repetition
priming is the N400 component (Brown & Hagoort, 1993; Kutas
& Hillyard, 1984), starting around 350 ms and ending around
550 ms with a central-posterior scalp distribution that was most
negative to targets that were completely unrelated to their primes,
least negative to targets that were complete repetitions of their
primes and intermediate to targets that partially overlapped their
primes. Holcomb and Grainger (2006) suggest that in its early
phase it reflects the mapping of lexical form onto meaning, with later N400 effects reflecting integration across semantic representations (see Lau, Phillips, & Poeppel (2008) for an extremely thorough
review of the literature on the timing, anatomical generators and
functional interpretations of the N400 response).
The masked priming paradigm combined with EEG recording
has now been used in four studies investigating morphological
priming, with results that are roughly consistent with this three
component/three stage model. Lavric, Clapp, and Rastle (2007)
(LCR); Morris et al. (2007) (MTGH) and Morris, Grainger, and Holcomb (2008) (MGH) all compared genuine, transparent derivational morphological complexity (Morph: teacher teach) with
pseudo complexity (Psuedo: corner  corn) and orthographic overlap (Ortho: brothel  broth) in English. The two Morris et al. studies
used the same materials, but while the 2007 study used the more
common lexical decision task, the 2008 study used a go/no-go
semantic categorization task. Royle, Drury, Bourguignon, and
Steinhauer (2010)(RDBS) compared French inflectional complexity
(Morph: cassait  casse `broke'  `break') with orthographic overlap (Ortho: cassis  casse `blackcurrant'  `break') and semantic
similarity (Sem: brise  casse`break'  `break') and used the lexical
decision task.
These four studies used slightly different variations on the
masked priming design (duration of masked prime, presence or

absence of backwards mask, SOA between prime and target, number of items, etc.), and focused on slightly different analysis time
windows and groupings of electrodes, which lead to inevitable differences in the results, summarized in (Table 1).
This pattern of results is roughly what we expect given the
behavioral masked priming, MEG single word and ERP repetition
priming studies: at the earliest latencies (100-200 ms) we see sensitivity to visual feature overlap between prime and target, but not
to semantics or to whether the overlap is morphological or not; between 200 and 300 ms, we see differentiation between morphoorthographic overlap and pure form overlap (in some studies);
and between 300 and 500 ms there is further dissociation between
genuine and pseudo morphological overlap.
But given the variability in each of these three time windows
across very similar studies, it's clear that more research is required
to establish the reliability, and therefore interpretability, of this
pattern.
Our research, then, was motivated by three goals: first, to directly compare regular and irregular morphological inflection processing in English using the masked priming + lexical decision
paradigm, which is so well established as a tool for investigating
the early stages of morphological processing; second, to use EEG
to track the time course of this processing and determine when differences between inflection types emerge; and third, to help resolve the inconsistencies in the ERP masked morphological
priming literature by adding data from English inflectional
allomorphy.
If regular inflectional morphology is detected on the basis of the
same morpho-orthograpic segmentation processes as affixal derivational morphology, we should see robust facilitation effects for
regular past tense priming in the N250 time window. If irregular
inflectional allomorphy is also detected and parsed on the basis
of morpho-orthographic features, then we should see similarly robust priming effects for irregular past tense to stem priming in the
same early time window. And if the N250 response is genuinely
sensitive to these processes of morpho-orthographic parsing, we
should see significant differences between morphological and
orthographic priming conditions (Lavric et al., 2007; Morris et al.,
2008).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
Twenty participants from the Tufts University community (15
female, aged 18-25, mean = 21.3) were paid for their participation
and gave informed consent to participate. The data from three subjects, one male and two females, were excluded from analysis, one
because of failure to complete the study, one for reporting a diagnosis of dyslexia, and one for excessive eye movement artifacts.
Participants were right-handed native English speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, with no reported linguistic or
neurological impairment.
2.2. Stimuli
The stimuli were 120 regular and 120 irregular past tense and
stem verb forms, chosen from the CELEX English database. These
120 irregular verbs almost exhaust the set of English irregular verb
roots (there are about 170 such roots in total, but 26 of these are
zero-change (hit, cut), and a further 18 are sufficiently uncommon
as to have lexical decision accuracy scores below 75% in the English
Lexicon Project Database (shrive-shrove, rend-rent, clothe-clad, etc)).
Thus unlike the studies by Crepaldi et al. (2010), Kielar et al. (2008)
and Pastizzo and Feldman (2002), our experiment offers a compre-

Each stem form appeared in four conditions: (a) primed by itself
(ID), (b) primed by its past tense form (PT), (c) primed by an Orthographic Control (OC) that differed in only one letter, and (d) primed
by an unrelated item with which it shared no letters (UN).
We matched regular and irregular verb stems on length and log
surface frequency (CELEX database, Baayen, Piepenbrock, & Van
Rijn (1993)) and past tense primes on log surface frequency as seen
in Table 2. An ANOVA on log surface frequency, with verb type
(regular, irregular) and Verb Tense (past, stem) as factors revealed
no main effects of either verb type (F(1, 238) = 2.005, p = .158) or
verb tense (F(1, 238) = 1.086, p = .298) and no significant interaction (F(1, 238) = 2.20, p = .139). A similar ANOVA on length revealed
a main effect of both Prime Type (F(1, 238) = 545.03, p < .001) and
verb tense (F(1, 238) = 52.512, p < .001) as well a significant interaction (F(1, 238) = 88.408, p < .001), due to the fact that regular past
tense primes were longer than all other conditions.
Across the two verb types we also matched the orthographic
control and unrelated prime conditions on length (OC and UN:
F(1, 238) = 3.497, p = .063) and log surface frequency (OC:
F(1, 238) = .427, p = .514; UN: F(1, 238) = .528, p = .468).
From these stimuli 4 lists were constructed, each containing 30
items per condition (240/list). No item appeared in more than one
condition in any given list. In a testing session each participant was
given 2 of the four lists, separated by a short break, and the order of
presentation of the two lists was counterbalanced across participants. Thus, each participant saw each target verb in two of the
four possible conditions. In total, each participant saw 480 experimental items, 60 in each of the 4 conditions. In addition to the
experimental items, each list contained 480 pseudoword filler
items created by changing one or two letters of an existing word
(nonwords were phonotactically well formed). As with the experimental items, 60 nonword targets were preceded by identity
primes, 60 by unrelated primes that shared no letters with the
target, 60 by primes that differed in only one letter, 30 by primes

2.3. Procedure
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair is a darkened
room at a distance of 140 cm from the computer monitor. Each
testing session began with a short practice block, followed by the
experimental block. Participants were told that they would see a
list of words and nonwords on the computer monitor and were instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible indicating whether the stimulus was a word (dominant hand) or not
(non-dominant hand) by pressing one of two response keys. Visual
stimuli were presented on a 19-inch monitor, with a diagonal
viewable screen size of 18 inches, and a width of approximately
14.5 in., set to a refresh rate of 100 Hz (which allows 10 ms resolution of stimulus control). Stimuli were displayed at high contrast as
white letters (Verdana font) on a black background. Each letter was
40 pixels tall by 20 pixels wide. The screen resolution was 800 by
600 pixels, and the visual angle subtended by stimuli ranged from
1.1 to 3.25. Primes were presented in lower case letters for 50 ms,
preceded by a 500 ms forward mask and a 20 ms backward mask
composed of hash marks (#######). The target was then presented in upper case letters for 300 ms followed by a 1200 ms ITI.
2.3.1. Recording procedure
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 29 active
tin electrodes held in place on the scalp by an elastic cap (Electrode-Cap International). In addition to the 29 scalp sites, additional electrodes were attached to below the left eye (to monitor
for vertical eye movement/blinks), to the right of the right eye
(to monitor for horizontal eye movements), over the left mastoid
bone (reference) and over the right mastoid bone (recorded actively to monitor for differential mastoid activity). All EEG electrode impedances were maintained below 5 kX (impedance for
eye electrodes was less than 10 kX). The EEG was amplified by
an SA Bioamplifier with a bandpass of 0.01 and 40 Hz and the
EEG was continuously sampled at a rate of 200 Hz throughout
the experiment.
2.3.2. Data analysis
ERPs time locked to the onset of target words in each category
were formed off-line from trials free of excessive artefact or response error. Trials characterized by EOG artefact in excess of
70 mV were rejected, resulting in 8.25% of trials being discarded.
This percentage did not vary significantly across experimental conditions (p > 0.9). In addition, any trials with incorrect behavioral responses were also excluded from the averages. All trials were

86

J. Morris, L. Stockall / Brain & Language 123 (2012) 81-93

baselined to the average of activity in the 100 ms pre-target period
and were low-pass filtered at 15 Hz. We calculated the mean voltage in the 100-200, 200-300 ms and 300-500 ms time windows
relative to the 100 ms pre-target baseline. The calculations in the
100-200 ms epoch were based on a different set of electrodes than
for the other epochs as explained below. These time epochs were
chosen because they correspond to peaks in the waveforms elicited
by the stimuli that were identified by visual inspection and also to
the latency ranges that have been found for the N/P150, the N250
and the N400 (Holcomb and Grainger, 2009).
We calculated difference scores by subtracting the latency or
mean amplitude for each of the three types of related trials (identity, past tense, and orthographic control) from those for the unrelated trials.
The univariate approach to repeated measures ANOVA requires
the assumption of sphericity. One form of sphericity is compound
symmetry, which requires that all variances of the repeated measurements are equal, and that all correlations between the pairs
of repeated measurements are equal (O'Brien & Kaiser, 1985).
When this assumption is violated, as is frequently the case with
ERP data sets, then various adjustments are introduced to compensate for the violations (e.g. Greenhouse & Geisser, 1959; Huynh &
Feldt, 1970; (techniques still widely used)). However, the contrasts
involved in testing repeated measures effects do not need to be
independent of each other if we use multivariate criteria to simultaneously test the statistical significance of the two or more repeated measures contrasts, hence the MANOVA approach to
repeated measures ANOVA has gained popularity in recent years
(Groh-Bordin, Zimmer, & Ecker, 2006; Maurer, Blau, Yoncheva, &
McCandliss, 2010; Pizzagalli, Regard, & Lehmann, 1999). In our
analyses, we follow the recommendations of O'Brien and Kaiser
(1985) and report multivariate test statistics.
All MANOVAs were run using the general linear model approach
in SPSS, and subjects were a random factor in all analyses. Fixed
factors were Verb Type, Prime Type, Anteriority and Laterality,
and all factors were crossed in the model. The Verb Type factor
contrasted mean ERP amplitude difference scores for the regular
and irregular verbs, while the Prime Type factor contrasted mean
ERP amplitude difference scores in the identity, past tense and
orthographic control conditions. To analyze the scalp distribution
of the ERP effects, we included two factors, Anteriority and Laterality. The Anteriority factor represented the anterior-posterior distribution of effects and included three levels contrasting
electrode locations from the back to the front of the head, while
the Laterality factor represented the left-right distribution and included three levels contrasting electrode locations at left hemisphere, midline and right hemisphere locations.
We report any significant main effects of the experimental factors verb type and prime type and any interaction of the topographical factors anteriority and laterality with the experimental
factors. We analyzed the mean amplitude difference scores by
selecting 9 representative sites distributed across the scalp (F3,
Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, P4) [see Fig. 2].
The N/P150 was analyzed with a specific set of six occipital and
frontal electrodes (O1,Oz, O2, FP1, FPz, FP2), selected because previous masked priming ERP studies have indicated that N/P150
priming effects are largely restricted to frontal pole and occipital
sites (Chauncey, Holcomb, & Grainger, 2008; Morris et al., 2008).
For these data, we again used a repeated-measures MANOVA with
four within-subjects factors (verb type, prime type, anteriority and
laterality), but for this data set, the Anteriority factor comprised
two, as opposed to three levels.
Voltage amplitudes vary considerably over the topography of
the head, but in the absence of interactions with the experimentally manipulated variables, these differences mean little, so we report only results concerning the main effects of the experimentally

manipulated factors, and the interaction of these factors with the
topographic factors anteriority and laterality.
We analyzed reaction times and accuracy rates with a 2  3 repeated measures ANOVA with verb type (regular, irregular), and
prime type (identity, past tense, orthographic control) as factors.
As with the electrophysiological data, difference scores were computed by subtracting the reaction times or error rates for each of
the three types of related trials (identity, past tense and orthographic control) from those for the unrelated trials. Any responses
that were below 200 ms or above 1500 ms were excluded from the
analysis.
The a level was set at 0.05. Planned comparisons for all analyses
were computed to investigate any effects involving more than two
conditions. Because we were interested primarily in the differences
between prime types, to investigate the main effect of Prime Type
or any interactions involving this factor, we compared identity to
past tense primes, identity to orthographic control primes and past
tense to orthographic control primes, producing three planned
comparisons. To correct for multiple comparison, we performed
Bonferroni corrections by multiplying each p-value by the number
of comparisons made. For all comparisons, we report the mean difference, the standard error, and the corrected p-values. Corrected
p-values that meet the a-threshold are marked with .
3. Results
3.1. Behavioral results
Analyses of the reaction time data (see Table 3) yielded a significant effect of Prime Type (F(2, 18) = 89.4, p < .001) as well as a
Prime Type by Verb Type interaction (F(2, 18) = 15.9, p < .001).
There was no main effect of verb type. Inspection of the mean difference scores for the main effect of prime type showed that identity primes elicited significantly greater priming effects than past
tense primes (MID  PT = 13.6(2.1), t = 6.38, p < .001). In turn,
the priming effect for past tense primes was greater than for orthographic control primes (MPT  OC = 35.0(4.4), t = 7.95, p < .001).
The verb type by prime type interaction arose because for regular verbs, past tense primes produced greater priming effects than
did orthographic control primes (MPT  OC = 49.8(6.3), t = 7.89,
p < .001) but did not differ from identity primes (MPT  ID = 1.0
(3.2), t = 0.31, p = 1.0). In contrast, for irregular verbs, past tense
primes were less effective than identity primes (MPT  ID = 26.2
(4.1), t = 4.66, p < .001), but produced greater effects than Orthographic Control primes (MPT  OC = 20.1 (4.3), t = 9.11, p < .001).
Analysis of the accuracy scores (Table 4) revealed a significant
main effect of prime type (F(2, 18) = 8.0, p < .003) but no effect of
verb type and no prime type by verb type interaction (all ps > .1).
Planned comparisons indicated that responses to targets preceded
by their stems and to those preceded by past tense forms did not
differ (MID  PT = 1.04 (0.6), t = 1.71, p = .3), but orthographic controls primes were significantly less effective than both identity
primes (MID  OC = 4.1 (1.0), t = 3.99, p = .002) and past tense
primes (MPT  OC = 3.0 (0.8), t = 3.76, p = .004).
3.2. ERP results
Fig. 1 plots the mean sensor activation for regular and irregular
verb targets preceded by identity, unrelated, and past tense primes
over all sensors. In the epoch from 0-800 ms after the onset of the
target we observed an initial small negative-going potential (N1)
peaking between 40 and 70 ms immediately followed by a larger
positivity peaking between 140 and 180 ms. These early potentials
are likely to reflect sensory processing related to processing the
mask, prime and target stimuli. Following these early potentials,

we observed a series of two negative deflections, the first peaking
around 250 ms post-target (N250) and the second at around
400 ms post target (N400). Both were maximal at centro-parietal
sites.
The two negativities (N250 and N400) were followed by a large
positive deflection peaking around 500 ms (which we call the late
positive component, or LPC). A number of studies suggest that this
late positive component (LPC) of the event related potential can be
viewed as an index of stimulus evaluation and comparison processes (Kutas, McCarthy, & Donchin, 1977; McCarthy, 1981). In a
`same/different' decision paradigm as well as a semantic categorization paradigm, Chabot, York, and Waugh (1984) found high correlations between mean response latency and the latency value
where the LPC reached its maximum value at the electrode positions monitored (Pz, Cz, C30 ) (midway between C3 and P3) and
C40 (midway between C4 and P4). Thus we decided to conduct post
hoc tests to investigate this component.
Fig. 2 plots the difference waves, computed by subtracting the
mean voltage for each of the three types of related trials (past
tense, identity and orthographic control) from those for the unrelated trials, at nine electrode sites. The difference waves isolate
the components of interest more clearly by removing variations
in voltage that are common to all conditions leaving only the differences related to the experimental manipulation. These difference waves were the dependent measure in the statistical
analyses reported below.

orthographic control) conditions from the unrelated conditions at
150 ms, 250 ms and 400 ms post-target for regular (Panel A) and

3.2.1. 100-200 ms epoch
To analyse the N/P150 component we used a specific set of six
occipital, central and frontal electrodes (O1, Oz, O2, FP1, FPz, FP2),
selected because previous masked priming ERP studies have indicated that N/P150 priming effects are largely restricted to these
sites (Chauncey et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2008). We analyzed the
data with a repeated measures MANOVA with verb type, prime
type, anteriority and laterality as factors, as described in the data
analysis section. We did not find any significant differences in this
time window related to either of our experimental factors of verb
type or prime type (all ps > 0.5).

3.2.2. 200-300 ms epoch
Analyses of the mean amplitude data in this time window
yielded a significant effect of prime type (F(2, 18) = 18.4,
p < .001) as well as a significant prime type by laterality interaction (F(4, 16) = 4.1, p = 0.17). There was no main effect of verb type,
nor did verb type participate in any significant interactions (all
ps > 0.1).
Inspection of the mean amplitude difference for the main effect
of prime type (see Table 5) showed that while targets in both the
past tense and identity conditions elicited N250 priming effects,
those in the orthographic control condition showed no significant
priming. Planned comparisons confirmed these findings; the mean
amplitude difference for targets in the identity and past tense conditions did not differ (MPT  ID = 0.3 (0.3), t = 1.16, p = 0.78), but
the mean amplitude difference for targets in the orthographic control condition was significantly more positive (a smaller N250
priming effect) than for those in the identity (MOC  ID = 1.1
(0.2), t = 4.77, p < .001) and past tense conditions (M OC  PT = 0.8
(0.2), t = 4.78, p = .001). Visual inspection of the voltage maps revealed that the Prime Type by Laterality interaction was probably
due to the fact that the effect appeared greatest at midline sites.
3.2.3. 300-500 ms epoch
Analyses of the mean amplitude data in this time window
yielded a significant effect of prime type (F(2, 18) = 16.6,
p < .001) as well as a significant prime type by anteriority interaction (F(4, 16) = 3.9, p = .021). There was no main effect of Verb
Type, nor did Verb Type participate in any significant interactions
(all ps > 0.1).
Inspection of the mean amplitude differences (Table 6) for the
main effect of prime type revealed that prime-target pairs in both
the past tense and identity conditions elicited large N400 priming
effects, i.e. more negative responses to unrelated than to related
pairs. In contrast, there was no significant priming effect for
prime-target pairs in the orthographic control condition.
Planned comparisons confirmed these findings, showing that
mean amplitude differences for items in the identity and past tense
conditions did not differ (MID  PT = 0.04 (0.3), t = 0.16, p = 1.0),
but that the difference for items in the orthographic control condition was significantly more positive than for those in the identity
(MOC  ID = 1.2 (0.3), t = 3.97, p = .002) and past tense conditions
(MOC  PT = 1.25 (0.2), t = 5.84, p < .001).
Visual inspection of the voltage maps, and pairwise comparisons (Table 7), revealed that the prime type by anteriority interaction was due to the centro-parietal distribution of the effect,
typical of the N400; at centro-parietal sites the N400 priming effect
for prime-target pairs in the identity and past tense conditions was
greater than for pairs in the orthographic control condition. However at frontal sites, these differences between conditions were not
as great.
3.2.4. Late Positivity (LPC)
In the response time and accuracy measures, regular past
tense and identity primes evoked equivalent priming effects but

Fig. 2. Grand average difference waveforms at 9 scalp electrode sites for regular (Panel A) and irregular (Panel B) verbs. The difference waveforms were computed by
subtracting the amplitude for each of the three types of related trials (past tense (dashed line), identity (dotted/dashed line) and orthographic control (solid line)) from those
for the unrelated trials, thus larger amplitude difference waves reflect a larger difference between Related and unrelated trials. Negative voltages are plotted upward. Where
amplitudes for both the Related and unrelated trials have the same sign () and priming is associated with a decrease in amplitude, the resulting difference waves share this
sign. Target onset is marked by the vertical calibrating bar, and each tick mark on the x-axis represents 100 ms. To the right of each panel is shown an enlarged view of
electrode site CZ to illustrate in greater detail the N250, N400 and LPC. At the center of the figure we show the electrode montage. The nine sites used for the MANOVA are
highlighted.

irregular past tense primes, although they produced greater effects
than orthographic control primes, were less effective primes than
identity primes.
In contrast, the electrophysiological data showed that for both
regular and irregular verbs, past tense and identity primes were
equally effective in reducing the amplitude of the N250 and
N400 components. Visual inspection of our data suggested that
the peak latency of the late positive component (LPC) might correlate with our behavioral data. Thus we decided to conduct a post
hoc analysis of peak latency difference scores in the 300-700 ms
interval post stimulus onset at electrode site Pz where the amplitude of the LPC was maximal, to see test this hypothesis. As with

the amplitude data, difference scores, i.e. priming effects, were
computed by subtracting the peak latency for each of the three
types of related trials (identity, past tense and orthographic control) from that for the unrelated trials.
We conducted a 2  3 repeated measures MANOVA with verb
type (regular, irregular), and prime type (identity, past tense,
orthographic control) as factors. We found a significant effect of
prime type (F(2, 18) = 48.6, p < .001) as well as a significant prime
type by verb type interaction (F(2, 18) = 4.13, p = .03).
Planned comparisons conducted to examine the main effect of
prime type showed that orthographic control primes elicited smaller priming effects (longer latencies) than both past tense

(MID  OC = 68.9 (6.8), t = 10.13, p < .001), but that past tense
and identity primed conditions did not differ from each other in latency (MID  PT = 15.75 (7.3), t = 2.16, p = .13) (see Table 8).
The verb type by prime type interaction arose because, for regular verbs, past tense primes produced greater effects (shorter
latencies) than did orthographic control primes (MPT  OC = 61.25
(13.5), t = 4.54, p = .001) but did not differ from identity primes
(MPT  ID = 1.25 (8.8), t = 0.14, p = 1.0). In contrast, for irregular
verbs, past tense primes were less effective than identity primes
(MPT  ID = 32.75 (9.8), t = 3.35, p = .01), but produced greater
effects (shorter latencies) than orthographic control primes
(MPT  OC = 45.0 (16.6), t = 2.71, p = .04). This pattern was similar
to that found in the reaction time data.
4. Discussion
Our behavioral data were similar to those of previous overt
priming studies that have found full priming for regular verbs
and reduced priming for irregulars (Marslen-Wilson, Hare, & Older,
1993; Stanners, Neiser, Hernon, & Hall, 1979; Sonnenstuhl, Eisenbeiss, & Clahsen, 1999; Stockall & Marantz, 2006), and fit the pattern predicted by Crepaldi et al. (2010). Both regular and irregular
past tense primes significantly facilitated lexical decision times to
their stem targets as compared both to unrelated and to orthographically similar primes, but the magnitude of the effect was
greater by 18 ms for the regular than the irregular past tense
primes. Moreover, the priming effect for the regular verbs was
equivalent to the priming effect for identity primes, while irregular
past tense forms evoked less facilitation than identity primes did.
The ERP data revealed a different pattern. In the earliest measure, the N/P150, we found evidence of a main effect of priming
for all related vs. unrelated conditions. There was a reduction in

amplitude for targets following primes with which they share
many more physical features than unrelated primes, consistent
with previous interpretations of this response component (Holcomb & Grainger, 2006).
In both the N250, and the N400 time windows, our main epochs
of interest, we found significant effects of the priming manipulation for both regular and irregular past tense primes, and no differences in the magnitude of the responses to the two types of target
(but significant differences between morphological priming and
orthographic overlap). By contrast, the latency of the late positivity
shows greater facilitation effects for regular and identity prime
conditions than for the irregular, consistent with the RT data. This
difference between the early and late response components (Table 9) suggests that the effects of masked priming that we observed
reflect at least two distinct underlying processes, only one of
which--indexed by the LPC and by reaction times--is sensitive to
the verb type distinction.
Because the N250 and the N400 reflect early stages of lexical
processing, namely the mapping of orthographic representations
onto whole-word orthographic representations and the subsequent mapping of lexical form onto meaning, they allow us a snapshot of the very earliest stages of complex word recognition, where
the effects of the priming manipulation for regular and irregular
pairs on the N250 and N400 appear equivalent.
What we add to the results of previous masked priming investigations of regular and irregular allomorphy is the detailed temporal resolution provided by ERPs, which enables us to determine
whether differences in the behavioral responses to irregular and
regular masked priming conditions are a result of early, automatic
or late, decision related processes. We find that at the earliest
stages where we can expect to observe effects of linguistic processing, both regular and irregular allomorphy are associated with the
same pattern of evoked responses, consistent with theories of morphology that make no categorical distinction between the two.
These results also help to resolve some of the uncertainty about
interpreting previous results from ERP studies investigating
masked morphological priming. The clear dissociation between
morphological and orthographic overlap priming in the N250 response is consistent with the findings of Lavric et al. (2007) and
Morris et al. (2008), and, more generally, with the single word
reading MEG studies (Zweig & Pylkkanen, 2008; Solomyak & Marantz, 2010; Lewis et al., 2011) that find early, visual word form
based morphological complexity effects.1 The fact that we get this
same dissociation between morphological and orthographic form
relatedness for regular inflectional priming instils confidence that
this body of results really reflects general morpho-orthographic
analysis mechanisms (rather than processes specific to derivational
morphology). And finally, the fact that we also get equivalent results
for irregular inflectional priming suggests that these analysis mech-

The fact that the single word reading MEG studies which use cortical sourcespace models to determine regions of interest find effects 50-100 ms earlier than the
EEG, masked priming studies reporting averaged sensor data is not cause for alarm. In
fact Mohanan, Fiorentino, and Poeppel (2008) investigate masked repetition priming
using MEG. Employing averaged sensor data analysis techniques, they find significant
priming effects peaking around 225 ms post stimulus onset.

anisms are capable of handling a wider range of morphological exponence than previously thought.
However, it is worth noting that although irregular past tense
priming is not associated with significantly different effects than
regular Past Tense priming or identity priming in these early
epochs, numerically the impact of the related prime is different
for these three conditions, and different in the two early time windows. The magnitude of the N250 priming effect is greatest for the
identity priming condition, and weakest for the regular verb priming condition, with the irregular verb priming effect lying almost
exactly between the two. For the N400 response, however, irregular past tense priming is associated with the largest effect, regular
past tense priming with the smallest effect, and identity priming in
the middle. Given that these are mere numerical trends, and not
predicted by either the Crepaldi et al. (2010) model or by the
Stockall and Marantz (2006) model, we resist the temptation to
speculate about their possible interpretation. Further research,
perhaps using techniques like the correlational analyses of Solomyak and Marantz (2010) is clearly required.
What we can conclude from our results is that a mere 50 ms of
exposure to `sold' is sufficient to affect the early, visual word form
based processing of `sell' just as strongly as 50 ms of exposure to
`walked' facilitates processing of `walk' (or even as strongly as
50 ms of exposure to a word affects reactivation of that same word
in the identity priming condition), despite the lack of an orthographically transparent morphological relationship between the
two forms in the sold  sell cases. For this to be possible, the morphological relationship between `sold' and `sell' must be accessible
to early stages of form based, pre-semantic processing -- with only
50 ms of prime exposure and 20 ms SOA between prime and target,
there is no time for `sold' to activate `sell' on the basis of the kinds
of lexical semantic similarity associations posited in the Word and
Rules (Pinker & Prince, 1988, chap. II) model.
This result has clear consequences for our models of the mental
lexicon. The combined results of Crepaldi et al. (2010), Kielar et al.
(2008), Pastizzo and Feldman (2002), and Meunier and MarslenWilson (2000) and the data reported above (together with the substantial masked priming and MEG single word reading evidence for
regular decomposition) clearly favor a model in which all potentially morphologically complex letter strings are very rapidly
parsed into their constituent morphemes, even when that process
of parsing does not involve simply stripping off linearly adjacent
affixes.
Given Crepaldi et al. (2010)'s failure to find pseudo-irregular
priming effects (`bold' did not prime `bell'), but our finding of robust irregular allomorph priming effects in the N250 time window
associated with visual word form processing (Holcomb & Grainger,
2006), it is clear that further research is required to pin down the
exact mechanisms involved in word form based parsing of irregular allomorphy. Kielar et al. (2008) found that irregulars ending in
`-t' or `-d' evoked greater reaction time priming responses than
irregulars without any overt exponent of the regular past tense
morpheme--exactly what we would expect given morpho-orthographic analysis mechanisms sensitive to sub-regularities (Albright
& Hayes, 2003).
If we have now established that such a highly irregular set of
forms as the English irregular past tense verbs are rapidly and reliably parsed as morphologically complex, then this early form
based parsing mechanism is hypothesized to be very general indeed. Other `irregular' morphological phenomena, including Semitic templatic morphology (McCarthy, 1981), process morphology
such as reduplication (Marantz, 1982), productive ablaut (Anderson, 1985), and polysynthesis (Baker, 1996) are all predicted to
be processed by similar mechanisms (modulo variations in
orthographic systems). To the extent that the processing of these
phenomena have been investigated using paradigms that allow

92

us to distinguish early from late stages of processing, the evidence
is consistent with this prediction (Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson,
2001; Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2004; Badecker & Allen, 2002;
Frost, Deutsch, & Forster, 2000; Kazanina, Dukova-zheleva, Geber,
Kharlamov, & Tonciulescu, 2008), but further confirmatory research is of course required. The research reported here, which
combines the brief stimulus presentation of masked priming with
the detailed temporal resolution of EEG provides a clear starting
point for this research.
