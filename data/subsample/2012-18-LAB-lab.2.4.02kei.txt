Dutch nouns are divided into two groups according to grammatical gender
which is, among others, marked on the definite determiner: common nouns take
the definite determiner de and neuter nouns take the definite determiner het.
This study is unique in systematically investigating the acquisition of grammatical gender and the definite determiner in the production and knowledge data of
the same Dutch children. Three groups of children were examined: (i) typically
developing monolinguals (L1-TD: 6;7-9;11), (ii) monolinguals with Specific
Language Impairment (L1-SLI: 8;4-12;0), and (iii) typically developing bilinguals, who are early second language learners (eL2: 6;7-10;0). The three groups
of children reveal different stages in discovering that de and het cover the gender
paradigm. At comparable ages, the L1-TD children have completed this paradigm discovery; however, the eL2 children have not yet completed it, and the L1SLI children are only at the first stage of the discovery of the gender paradigm.

Introduction

The Dutch language classifies nouns into two grammatical gender categories:
common and neuter nouns. Grammatical gender is reflected in a number of agreeing elements accompanying the noun or referring to it. Definite determiners are
a clear case: singular definite determiners vary morphologically according to the

gender of the noun, as illustrated in Table 1 below. Nouns that take the singular
definite determiner de, such as de hond (the dog) are called de-words and have
common gender. Nouns that take the singular definite determiner het, such as
het konijn (the rabbit), are called het-words, and have neuter gender. There is no
gender distinction on the singular indefinite determiner, which is een for both
neuter and common nouns, and on the plural definite determiner, which is de for
both genders.

Experimental results have revealed that monolingual acquisition of neuter gender
of the Dutch definite determiner is a long process as children do not acquire the
target system before the age of seven (see Blom, Polienska, & Weerman, 2008;
Bol & Kuiken 1988; De Houwer & Gillis, 1998). The developmental literature distinguishes four stages in the acquisition of Dutch determiners, as summarized in
Table 2.
Table 2. Stages of acquisition of the definite determiners de and het
Stage 1: only bare nouns
Stage 2:indefinite determiner een `a(n)' or schwa-element + noun which can be interpreted
as the indefinite determiner
Stage 3a: definite determiner de with both [common] and [neuter] nouns
Stage 3b:first appearance of het, but massive overgeneralization of the definite determiner de
Stage 4: target system (L1-TD: not before the age of seven)

Table 2 reveals that monolingual children overgeneralize the definite determiner
de and use it incorrectly with neuter nouns that require the definite determiner het.
What is needed for the acquisition of determiners and grammatical gender is (i) the
presence of the syntactic position D (determiner), (ii) the lexical and grammatical
properties of the noun (N), (iii) agreement between D -- N, and (iv) features and
morphology of the determiner (Cornips & Hulk, 2008). However, there is little
evidence for grammatical gender in Dutch input compared to German, Spanish,
and French for instance. In Dutch, gender is not directly marked on the noun, but
is only visible on single definite determiners and demonstratives. However, there
is no gender distinction on indefinite determiners and plural definite determiners.
Furthermore, there are frequency differences between neuter (25%) and common
(75%) nouns and there are very few morpho-phonological cues for the different

Knowing versus producing 381

gender forms of the determiner, with the exception of diminutives. Although there
are some morphological and semantic regularities, these are limited and many
exceptions exist (see Blom, Polienska & Unsworth (2008) for an overview).
In previous studies (Brouwer, Cornips, & Hulk, 2008; Cornips & Hulk, 2008;
Roodenburg & Hulk, 2008, 2009; Unsworth & Hulk, 2010) it has therefore been
argued that young children acquiring Dutch initially have no gender specification
in their grammar. They only use the feature specification [definite] for which they
choose de as the `default' value, possibly due to its overwhelming presence in the
input and syncretism between singular (common) and plural. At a certain point in
development, children become aware of gender as an abstract grammatical specification. In other words, they are aware that de and het are related to grammatical
gender, but they do not know the correct gender specification (yet). In light of the
sparse evidence for grammatical gender in the Dutch input and the developmental
paths of the children, it is assumed that children do not start classifying nouns
according to gender. Rather, the child's grammar contains a definiteness feature
only, which results in the default production of de with all definite nouns (see
Hulk & Cornips, 2010). In addition to typically developing monolingual children,
monolingual children with SLI and early bilingual children have been investigated
regarding their acquisition of grammatical gender and the definite determiner in
Dutch. The comparison of these three groups of young language learners is relevant as it provides us with more insight into the subsequent stages children go
through in acquiring grammatical gender (see Cornips, Van der Hoek, & Verwer,
2006).
Previous research has shown that bilingual children who acquire Dutch as a
second language early in life have more difficulties, and for a longer period of time,
with the acquisition of neuter gender than monolingual children, irrespective of
their other language (Cornips & Hulk, 2008; Cornips et al., 2006; Hulk & Cornips,
2006a, 2006b). Similarly, monolingual children with SLI between the ages of 6;1
and 8 years extensively overuse de where het should be used, namely in 62% of the
cases (see Orgassa, 2009, p. 133; Orgassa & Weerman, 2008). In almost all studies,
only data were presented from production tasks concerning the accurate use of the
definite determiners de and het. However, Brouwer, Cornips, and Hulk (2008) have
examined both production and judgment data. They found a difference between
the production and judgment data of bilingual children between 11 and 13 years.
Their production data showed an extreme overgeneralization of de, while their
judgment data revealed that these children did have some awareness of de and het
as gender markers, and that these forms belong to the same paradigm. In the same
study, monolinguals between 11 and 13 years performed target-like in production and judgment. However, Unsworth and Hulk (2010) found a similar difference between production and judgment for a younger group of L1-TD children

382 Brigitta Keij, Leonie Cornips, Roeland van Hout, Aafke Hulk and Joanne van Emmerik

between 4 and 7 years. This data reveals a striking two-way difference between,
firstly, the development of monolingual and bilingual children, and secondly, between production and judgment data. Therefore, a more systematic investigation
of the acquisition of the definite determiner in Dutch from both a production and
a knowledge perspective is needed.
The main aim of this paper is to systematically examine and compare different groups of children in age ranges not investigated in previous studies and for
both their production and knowledge. Therefore, we conducted a study in which
the same children were examined on their acquisition of the Dutch definite determiner on both production and knowledge tasks (Keij, 2009). Three groups of
children were examined; that is, a monolingual (L1-TD) control group (6;7-9;11),
a bilingual (eL2) group (6;7-10;0), and a monolingual group with SLI (L1-SLI)
(8;4-12;0). The comparison of these last two groups is a relevant and common
procedure in L2 and SLI research, as comparable linguistic problems often emerge
in these two groups (Gruter, 2005; Hakansson & Nettelbladt, 1993; Paradis, 2004,
Paradis & Crago, 2000). Orgassa (2009) also applied this approach in her investigation into the acquisition of grammatical gender and the definite determiner in
Dutch.
The specific aim of this paper is to reveal the developmental path for the acquisition of the gender of the definite determiner. The questions addressed in this paper
relate to differences between the three groups of children, to differences between
production and knowledge within the groups, and to differences between the age
groups. Previous research results lead to our prediction (i) that the monolingual
children will show more target-like patterns than the eL2 children and children
with SLI (Orgassa, 2009). Among other accounts1, Ellis Weismer and Evans (2002)
consider SLI as a processing limitation which would lead children with SLI to have
problems with analyzing linguistic input. Consequently, they need more input, or
input over a longer period of time, to acquire certain grammatical features of language, which possibly causes the delay in language development. Given that both
monolingual children with SLI and bilingual children encounter serious problems
with the acquisition of neuter gender in Dutch, Orgassa and Weerman (2008) suggest that any similarities between bilingual children and children with SLI can be
understood in terms of factors that influence the intake, rather than in terms of
access to grammatical principles. Children with SLI have a processing deficit and
bilingual children have received less Dutch input, both factors causing reduced
intake. Orgassa (2009) therefore hypothesized that the language development of
early second language learners of Dutch is similar to that of monolingual Dutch
children with SLI. Based on Orgassa (2009), our prediction (ii) is that eL2 children
will perform as accurately as the L1-SLI children on at least the Production task.
Given the literature, our further prediction (iii) is that all children will perform

Knowing versus producing 383

more target-like in knowledge than in production (Brouwer et al., 2008, Unsworth
& Hulk, 2010). With respect to the question of development, our prediction (iv)
is that the older children will perform more target-like than the younger children
within all three groups.
In the following section the participants, the design, and the methodology
are described. In the third section the group results of the Production and the
Knowledge tasks are presented, as well as the children's individual strategies. The
fourth and final section is devoted to the discussion and the conclusions.
2. Participants, design, and methodology
We collected data from 74 children on both a Production and a Knowledge task.
Before doing these two tasks, the children were required to perform a lexicon task
to ensure they were familiar with the nouns used in the experiments. The group
of participating children is comprised of (i) 26 monolingual children (L1), (ii)
28 bilingual (eL2) children, and (iii) 20 monolingual children with SLI (L1-SLI).
The age of onset of acquisition of Dutch for the 28 bilingual children is difficult
to determine, because they were born in the Netherlands, but were not raised in
so-called one-parent-one-language families and language choices in the home domain are inconclusive (Cornips & Hulk, 2008). Previous studies suggest a complex
interplay between the factors of input quantity and age of onset, in particular with
respect to the acquisition of grammatical gender in Dutch (Unsworth et al., 2011).
It is therefore important to note that the exact age of onset of acquisition is not
the most determining factor in the acquisition of grammatical gender in Dutch
(Cornips & Hulk, 2008, Unsworth et al., 2011). The other languages (L1s) of the
children varied considerably; namely 15 different L1s and several multilingual
children (speaking more than two languages) (Appendix A).
The 26 monolingual children with SLI were diagnosed by a qualified speech
therapist based on exclusion criteria; that is, they have language problems without any sensory, general cognitive, motoric, psychological, or input related causes
underlying the deficit (Leonard, 2003; Orgassa, 2009; Schaerlaekens & GoorhuisBrouwer, 2000). Finally, since the aim is to examine the developmental path, all
three groups of children were selected from two age ranges according to school
levels in the Netherlands. The monolingual children with SLI were two years
older, because research has shown that they typically demonstrate a two year delay behind typically developing monolingual children (Bishop & Leonard, 2000;
Orgassa, 2009; Southwood, 2007). The exact age ranges are given in Table 3.

2.1 The lexicon task
A word-to-picture-matching task was conducted (Van Emmerik, Van Hout, Van
de Craats, & Klatter-Folmer, 2009) whereby the child was expected to point at the
picture that represented the word presented to them by the researcher. The words
were presented to the children both in written and in spoken form. Four different
pictures were presented to them simultaneously and the children were asked to
point at the picture that matched the word. Figure 1 shows an example of the task
using the noun auto `car' and four photographs: the correct picture (the car), a
semantically related picture (the motorcycle), and two unrelated pictures (the egg
and the teddy bear). An overview of the nouns used in the lexicon task is provided
in Table 4. The items which are shaded were used in the Production task as well
as in the Knowledge task2. All the participants scored 100% correct on the task,
demonstrating they were familiar with all nouns presented to them.

2.2 The Production task
Unsworth (2008) developed a sentence completion task, based on Blom, Orgassa,
and Polienska (2008) (see Unsworth & Hulk, 2010, Unsworth et al., 2011). This
task investigates the target-like productive use of the definite determiners de and
het with respect to common and neuter test items. The participants were asked
to produce 14 singular nouns twice (seven common and seven neuter nouns),
preceded by a definite determiner and an adjective. The stimuli were presented to
the participants visually on a laptop screen in Microsoft PowerPoint and the outcomes of the task were recorded with Audacity and later transcribed. The laptop
screen showed two pictures: for example, a boy standing next to a brown horse
and a girl standing next to a white horse, as illustrated in Figure 2. Both pictures
were introduced: ((I)nterviewer) "Here you see two horses. A brown horse and a
white horse" and then the child ((C)hild) was required to complete the following
sentences started by the interviewer:
 I: Het meisje staat naast..
 C: het witte paard

`the girl stands next to..'
`the white horse'

 I: De jongen staat naast..
 C: het bruine paard

`the boy stands next to..'
`the brown horse'

This test format required the child to complete the sentence with a noun phrase
consisting of a definite determiner, an adjective, and a singular noun. An example
of a test item picture of this Production task is presented in Figure 2.

2.3 The Knowledge task
The third task was a multiple choice task designed to `tap into the knowledge' of
the children. Keij (2009) adapted a task, which was originally developed for adults
(see Van Emmerik et al., 2009). The stimuli consisted of 20 test items (10 common
and 10 neuter nouns) presented visually in words and a picture on a laptop screen
in E-prime and auditorily through headphones as auditive support. The participants were provided with the instruction that a foreign girl is learning Dutch and
that she needs some help from the child. Every experimental item consisted of
the noun presented with a correct and an incorrect definite determiner. Through
E-prime, the child was asked:
 Which is correct? (`Wat is goed?')
 1. *Het auto `the car' (neuter) 2. De auto `the car' (common).

The participant was required to choose the correct determiner-noun combination
by pressing key 1 or 2 on the keyboard. Figure 3 gives an example of a test item.
The participants were tested individually in a quiet room in their school. Each
participant required approximately 15 minutes to complete the three tasks.

and eL2 group and 10-12 year olds in the L1-SLI group. The box-plot in Figure 4
shows that there is a wide range of scores in all groups across the school levels in
the production of the determiner. The variation is reduced in the monolingual
groups because the bilingual and SLI groups include participants demonstrating a
bias for the common gender option of de (high scores) or the neuter gender option
of het (low scores on this part of the task).
Most noteworthy of the box-plot in Figure 5 is the revelation that the scores
are lower than in Figure 4. The bilingual and SLI groups appear to perform below
the level of .80 in both age levels. Table 5 gives the average score per group and
age level. The large standard deviations illustrate the within-group variation. Most
monolinguals approached complete acquisition, but there were still exceptions at
the age levels investigated.

An analysis of variance on all data revealed two strong effects (partial eta squared
> .30). The first effect was a general gender effect distinguishing de- and het-words
(F(1,68)=31.430, p < .001, partial eta square = .316). The second strong effect was
the group factor (F(2,68)=31.954, p < .001, partial eta square = .484). A Tukey posthoc test showed that the bilingual group (p = .000) and SLI group (p = .000) differed
significantly from the monolingual control group. The bilingual group and the SLI
group, however, did not differ significantly from each other (p = .930). All other effects, including all interactions, were less strong (partial eta squared < .30), but significant. The complexity of the differences between the groups is illustrated in Figure 6,
which shows the interaction pattern between the three groups and age levels for the
neuter nouns. It shows no overall development for the SLI group, whereas the bilingual group seems to perform better at the older age level. Given the complexity of
the patterns it was decided to do a separate analysis of variance per group.

The monolingual data returned a strong gender effect (F(1,24) = 21.183,
p = .000, partial eta squared =.469). The monolingual children perform better on
de-words. A main age level effect was found as well (F(1,24)=5.906, p = .023, partial eta squared =.197). There was no interaction for gender by age level effect
(F(1,24)=1.586, p = .220, partial eta squared =.062).
The results for the bilingual group only returned a significant effect for age
level (F(1,24) =6.967, p = .014, partial eta squared = .211). No effect was found for
gender (F<1) and the interaction of gender by age level (F(1,24)=1.586, p = .220,
partial eta squared =.062). In interpreting the results, it must be taken into account
that due to the amount of variation between the children, only large effects can be
revealed. A high level of variation is found in both groups of nouns.
The outcomes for the SLI group did not deliver any significant effect. There is
no main effect for gender (F(1,24) = 3.039, p = .098, partial eta squared = .144) and
age level (F < 1), and no interaction effect for gender by age level (F(1,24) = 2.081,
p = .166, partial eta squared = .104). The group of SLI children is marked by large
differences among the children, resulting in high levels of variation, as can be seen
in Figures 4 and 5.
3.1.2 Knowledge task
The results on the Knowledge task are presented in the box-plots of Figures 7
and 8 and in Table 6. The box-plot of the knowledge of the de-words in Figure 7
shows that there is a lot of variation in the bilingual and SLI groups; however most

390 Brigitta Keij, Leonie Cornips, Roeland van Hout, Aafke Hulk and Joanne van Emmerik

children have a clear preference for the determiner de. All monolingual children
turn out to perform at a high level which implies a clear reduction in variation. The
boxplot of the het-words in Figure 8 shows more variation for the monolingual
children compared to Figure 7, indicating that they have more problems with het.
The other two groups clearly show divergent achievements between the children,
and there is no clear age level effect. Table 6 gives the average scores per subgroup
and age level. The standard deviations are large, except for in the monolingual
group. The monolinguals approach complete acquisition, but there are exceptions
at the age levels investigated.

An analysis of variance on all data revealed three significant effects: a gender effect
(F(1,68)= 6.271, p = .015, partial eta squared = .08), a group by age level interaction effect (F(2,68)=5.658, p = .005, partial eta squared =.143), and a group effect
(F(2,68)=12.051, p = .000, partial eta squared = .262). A post-hoc Tukey analysis
gave the same outcomes as the Production task. There was an overall difference
between the monolingual group (performing better) and the two other groups
(p = .000), but there was no overall difference between the bilingual and SLI group
(p = .979). All other effects were non-significant (gender by group, F(2,68)=1.949,
p = .150, partial eta squared = .054; gender by age level, F < 1; gender by group by
age level, F(2,68) = 1.817, p = .479, partial eta squared = .051). Overall, the results
for the Knowledge task produce fewer, and also less obvious, effects than the results for the Production task. Because of the significant interaction in which the
group factor was involved, separate analyses of variance were applied to the three
groups.
The analysis of variance for the monolingual group gave two significant main
effects, i.e. gender (F(1,24) = 21.183, p = .000, partial eta squared = .469), and age
level (F(1,24) = 5.906., p = .023, partial eta squared = .197). The interaction effect
of gender by age level was not significant (F(1,24) = 1.586, p = .220. partial eta
squared = .062). The conclusion can be drawn that although the knowledge scores
are high, there is still progress between the two age levels, for both genders. The
neuter gender remains the more difficult category.
The results of the bilinguals seem to be straightforward. There is no gender
effect (F < 1) and no interaction between gender and age level (F < 1). The only
significant effect is age level (F(1,26) = 6.967, p = .014, partial eta squared = .221),
but this effect goes in the opposite direction of our prediction. The children in the

392 Brigitta Keij, Leonie Cornips, Roeland van Hout, Aafke Hulk and Joanne van Emmerik

second age level seem to have more doubts about the proper gender, both for the
common and neuter gender, than the children in the younger bilingual group.
The results of the SLI group are clear in the sense that none of the effects are
significant (gender (F(1,18) = 3.039, p = .098, partial eta squared = .144), gender
by level (F(1,18)= 2.081, p = .104, partial eta squared = .104), age level (F < 1)).
That means that the outcome is different from the bilingual group because of the
absence of an age level effect. In addition, the results hint at a gender effect, but
given the wide range of scores, potential effects are difficult to trace.
3.1.3 The production and knowledge data compared
The production and knowledge outcomes for each of the three groups of children
are summarized in a separate table. Table 7 gives the outcomes for the monolingual control group. The younger children have somewhat higher scores on the
Knowledge task, but the standard deviations are several times larger for neuter,
indicating larger differences among the children. The older children perform at
ceiling, both in the Production and the Knowledge task.

The analysis of variance returned two significant outcomes, both main effects. The
first one was gender (F(1,24) = 9.526, p = .005, partial eta squared = 284), the second one was age level ((F(1,24) = 6.944, p = .015, partial eta squared = .224). Het
is more difficult than de and the monolinguals still show progress growing older,
both in production and knowledge. All other effects had F values below 1, including the main effect for task (Production versus Knowledge), and the interaction
between task and the other factors. Therefore, no task effect whatsoever was found.
Table 8 presents the scores for both tasks for the bilingual children. The results
are more varied than for the monolinguals. The younger group of children shows
a remarkable difference between the Production and the Knowledge task. In their
production they achieve very high scores on de and very low scores on het. The
result is an extremely complex pattern.

All effects were significant except for the main effect of age level (F < 1). The effects
are not only significant, but often strong as well: task (F(1,26) = 10.821, p = .003,
partial eta squared = .294), task by age level (F(1,26) = 18.7911, p = .000, partial
eta squared = .421), gender (F(1,26) = 29.395, p = .000, partial eta squared = .531),
gender by age level (F(1,26) = 13.402, p = .001, partial eta squared = .340), task by
gender effect (F(1,26) = 15.286, p = .001, partial eta squared = .370), task by gender
by age level (F(1,26) = 5.451, p = .028, partial eta squared = .173). The two tasks
clearly render different results for the bilingual children. In both tasks they are
sensitive to the gender distinction, but the way they deal with it seems to be completely different. There is a clear development for het in the Production task but
a small one in the Knowledge task. As for de, it is striking that there is regression
over time in both production and knowledge.
Table 9 shows the results of both tasks for the monolingual children with SLI.
Given the large standard deviations and the absence of large differences, the question is whether any significant outcomes will be obtained.

The only significant effect was gender (F(1,18) = 11.703, p = .003, partial eta

squared = .053), task by gender by level (F < 1), and age level (F < 1). It is obvious
that the SLI group does not perform the same as the bilingual group.

3.1.4 The seven identical items in the production and knowledge data
The Production and the Knowledge task have seven nouns in common. The scores
on these seven items are presented in Table 10. For a more systematic comparison
it is interesting to look at these seven nouns in detail. For all the items, performance is better on the Knowledge task than on the Production task. However,
the differences are much larger for the neuter nouns than for the common nouns.

73% (SD= 44.7)

Paired samples t-tests show that the task effect is significant for all neuter nouns:
huis `house' (t(73) = -6.011, p = .000), paard `horse' (t(73) = -2.510, p = .014),
bord `plate' (t(73) = -4.752, p = .000), vliegtuig `airplane' (t(73) = -5.926, p = .000),
but for none of the common nouns: klok `clock' (t(73) = -.895, p = .374), pen `pen'
(t(73) = -.686, p = .495), beker `cup' (t(72) = -1.150, p = .254). This means that
the participants perform significantly better on the Knowledge task than on the
Production task when it concerns these particular neuter nouns, but they perform
equally well on the Production task and the Knowledge task for these particular
common nouns.
A test of within-subject effects again shows that there is a significant effect of
task (F(1,68) = 93.496, p = .000) and also a significant interaction of task by level
(F(1,68) = 3.608, p = .028). This interaction is shown in Figure 9. An analysis of
variance gives a significant effect of the factor level in the Production task (F(1,73)
= 7.367, p = .008), but this effect of level is not significant in the Knowledge task
(F(1,73) = .559, p = .457). This means that there is a clear development in production for the participants between level 1 and 2, while this development is not
present in the knowledge of the participants. A test of between-subject effects
shows that there is a significant effect of group (F(2,68) = 15.968, p = .000) and
level (F(1,68) = 4.783, p = .032). This means that the scores of the three groups and
between the two levels also differ on only these seven items.

An analysis of variance shows that there is only a significant effect of group in
the Production task for the neuter nouns paard `horse' (F(2,73) = 5.932, p = .004),
bord `plate' (F(2,73) = 6.697, p = .002), and vliegtuig `airplane' (F(2,73) = 8.388,
p = .001) and in the Knowledge task for only the neuter noun bord `plate' (F(2,73)
= 4.539, p = .014) and the common noun beker `cup' (F(2,73) = 8.166, p = .001).
Furthermore, there is only a significant effect of level in the Production task for
the neuter nouns huis `house' (F(1,73) = 6.792, p = .011), paard `horse' (F(1,73) =
4.246, p = .043), and bord `plate' (F(1,73) = 4.562, p = .036) and in the Knowledge
task there is no significant effect of level for any of the nouns. Therefore, a similar
pattern is visible for the effect of the factors group and level, as both effects are
specifically for neuter nouns in the Production task and are not visible or unspecific in the Knowledge task. This means that both the groups and the levels differ
mostly on the production of het. The differences between the groups are shown in
Figure 10.
3.2 Individual Patterns
3.2.1 Production task
The individual response patterns were examined in order to find out (i) which
patterns are most frequent and (ii) which children do or do not show a target-like
response pattern. Therefore, we have counted every token of de for the common
nouns and every token of het for the neuter nouns. An 80% cut-off level is used to
create the different response patterns (a response pattern occurring 80% or more
gets a + ; a response pattern occurring less than 20% gets a -). For example, if a

child produced the article de for common nouns 9 out of 10 times, but also produces the article de for neuter nouns 8 out of 10 times, this child receives a plus for
de with common nouns and a plus for de with neuter nouns. This means that the
columns in Table 11 and 12 contain a plus if the score is above 80% and a hyphen
if the score is below 20%. Two zeros for the same gender category means that the
scores are between 20% and 80%. Table 11 reveals that the target-like response
pattern (+--+) is the most frequent one (25 out of 74 children (34%), see shaded
row). The children in the L1-TD group produce this pattern most often (20/74,
77%). The most frequent response pattern in the bilingual (13/74, 46%) and the
L1-SLI (6/74, 30%) group is the one that is indicative of the overgeneralization
of de for neuter nouns (see grey rows) (comparable to the results of Cornips and
Hulk (2008) and Van Emmerik et al. (2009)). The total occurrence of this pattern
is 21/74 (28%). Another frequent pattern is the third pattern in which the common nouns are also target-like, but in which children mix de and het for neuter
words (+- 00). It occurs 13 out of 74 times (18%), and it is especially frequent in
the bilingual and SLI group. Other patterns occur as well, showing that the children are using different strategies in an attempt to deal with the gender puzzle.
Complete overgeneralization of het for common nouns is rare, occurring once, in
a child with SLI (-+-+).

3.2.2 Knowledge task
The most frequent pattern on this task was also the target pattern. This pattern is
most often produced by the L1-TD children (33/74 (45%)). It is again by far the
most frequent one for the monolingual children (77%). The second most frequent
pattern occurring in the monolinguals is the mixed pattern for the neuter gender (+-00). This pattern also plays a main role in the other two groups (bilingual
group 6 times, 21%; SLI group 6 times, 30%). The most remarkable observation
is the low frequency of the pattern of overgeneralization of de (+-+-). It occurs
only twice (3%), which is a drastic drop in comparison to the 21 times it occured
in the production data (28%). This drop indicates that children apply a different
strategy in the Knowledge task, that they are aware of the gender distinction when
forced to make a choice, and that they know, above chance level, which words have
neuter gender. Twelve children seem to make their choice randomly (their pattern
is 0000). Complete overgeneralization of het for de-words is rare again, occurring
once in one of the bilingual children (-+-+).

4. Discussion and conclusions
The aim of this paper was to examine the hypothesis that children do not start
classifying Dutch nouns according to gender. Rather, the child's grammar contains a definiteness feature only, and this results in the default production of de
with all definite nouns (see also Hulk & Cornips, 2010; Unsworth et al., 2011).
Children are required to establish that (i) Dutch has grammatical gender, (ii) there
is agreement between D -- N, and (iii) acquire the features and morphology of the
determiner. Our predictions were that (i) monolingual children would show more
target-like patterns than the L1-SLI and the bilingual children (Orgassa, 2009),
that (ii) bilingual children would perform as accurately as the L1-SLI children in
production tasks (Orgassa 2009), that (iii) all children would perform more targetlike on the Knowledge task than on the Production task (Brouwer et al., 2008), and
that (iv) in regards to development, the older children would perform more targetlike than the younger children within all groups.
The results show that the monolingual group as a whole shows a typical developmental pattern of the acquisition of the definite determiners for both de
with common nouns and het with neuter nouns, on both the Production and the
Knowledge task, as is expected for their age. This result is confirmed by the analysis of the individual response patterns. As we predicted (iv), the older children
perform better than the younger ones.
It is clear that the bilingual children and the monolingual children with SLI
are delayed in comparison to the monolingual control group. Both the Production
and Knowledge task show a large overall distinction between the monolingual
control group and the bilingual and SLI group. This finding confirms prediction
(i) that the monolingual children show more target-like patterns than the eL2 children and the L1 children with SLI. We will come back to this prediction when
discussing the individual response patterns, as these reveal that the children's performances and development are not completely similar. Furthermore, the findings
for the bilingual children and the monolingual children with SLI do not support
prediction (iv) of an age effect. No general age effect was found.
The same negative conclusion can be drawn for prediction (iii) that all children perform more target-like in knowledge than in production (Brouwer et al.,
2008; Unsworth & Hulk, 2010). There was no difference between the two tasks
for the monolingual children (due to their ceiling performance), nor for the L1SLI children, whereas the result was contrary to our predictions for the bilingual
children. They performed worse on the Knowledge task. The analyses of variance
gave different effects for the bilingual and L1-SLI groups indicating that the two
groups did not perform alike. All groups behave differently on their path towards

Knowing versus producing 399

target-like acquisition of grammatical gender of the definite determiner in Dutch.
This difference is not only quantitative, but also qualitative in nature.
With respect to the same neuter and common nouns that were offered in
both the Production and Knowledge task, the children performed better on the
Knowledge task than on the Production task for the neuter nouns, but they performed equally well for the common nouns. This result confirms the hypothesis in
previous studies in which it is claimed that young children acquiring Dutch initially do not have a gender specification in their grammar, but a definiteness feature
only which is spelled out as de. In this early stage of acquistion, they overgeneralize
de to neuter nouns (Brouwer et al., 2008; Cornips & Hulk, 2008; Roodenburg &
Hulk, 2008, 2009; Unsworth et al., 2011)
The individual patterns of the children convincingly reveal the distinction between the Production and the Knowledge task. A different strategy was evident
in the two tasks, especially for the monolingual children who often showed the
target pattern for both de- en het-words in the Knowledge task. That means that
they are aware of Dutch having grammatical gender, that they have knowledge of
which words are neuter and common, and of how to spell out this grammatical
gender feature on the determiner. Not all stages of acquiring the gender distinction produce higher scores for knowledge than for production. The differences in
response patterns between the bilingual and L1-SLI groups may indicate that these
two groups are not similar in their development (contra to Orgassa, 2009, p. 155:
suggesting that "(..) all child groups [both SLI and bilingual groups] used the same
error types (..)" and contra to prediction (ii)).
In summary, the evident differences in production and knowledge between
the two age groups and among the three different groups of child acquirers can be
accounted for as follows: In the first stage of acquisition of Dutch, young children
have no gender specification in their grammar. They only use the feature specification [definite] for which they choose de as the `default' value. In a later stage, they
become aware of gender as an abstract grammatical specification. In other words,
they are aware that de and het are related to grammatical gender, but they do not
know the right gender specification (yet). In that stage, they do not only overgeneralize de to neuter nouns, but they also sometimes overgeneralize het to common
nouns (see Cornips et al., 2006).
We argue that the three groups of children in this study reveal different stages
in the discovery that de and het are forms that both belong to the gender paradigm.
Since the oldest monolingual children (level 2) produce and have knowledge at
ceiling level for both de and het, they have completed this paradigm discovery. The
bilingual group has not yet completed it. However, the bilingual children at level
2 have an increasing awareness of Dutch grammatical gender. This was demonstrated in the Knowledge task where they are less certain about the proper gender

400 Brigitta Keij, Leonie Cornips, Roeland van Hout, Aafke Hulk and Joanne van Emmerik

of the nouns than the younger children. As a result, they may show a contrastive pattern, i.e. they may use het for de instead of de for het. Subsequently, the
bilinguals perform better in using het with neuter, but simultaneously perform
worse in using de with common nouns on the Knowledge task, compared with the
Production task. These children performed worse on the Knowledge task overall.
The children with SLI, however, are in the first stage of discovering the paradigm. They do not show any development in production or knowledge (contrary
to the bilinguals), but they are aware of the gender distinction. The next step for
them would be the one revealed by the bilinguals: a development in the accurate
use of het with neuter nouns in production. The variation among the children in
the L1-SLI group is too large to trace developmental patterns. Further research
with larger populations is needed to investigate the way L1-SLI children proceed
in acquiring the gender distinction.
To conclude, the monolingual control group has completed the discovery of
the gender paradigm, the bilingual group has not yet completed it, and the children
with SLI are in the first stage of discovering the paradigm at the ages investigated.

Notes
1. Alternative accounts of SLI include linguistic accounts on the one hand, such as the Missing
Agreement Hypothesis (Clahsen, 1988), the Missing Feature Hypothesis (Gopnik, 1990a,
1990b), and the Extended Optional Infinitive (EOI) account (Rice, Wexler, & Cleave, 1995), and
non-linguistic accounts on the other hand, for example Short Term (phonological) Memory
(STM) deficits (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990), problems in the temporal processing of speech
(Tallal, 1994), and the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (Ullman & Pierpont, 2005).
2. Not all items were used in both tasks, because the production task was an extension of the
initial research plan added at a later stage, and this task came from a different source than the
Knowledge task.
