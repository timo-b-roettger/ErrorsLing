ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Speakers know that it is hard to produce tongue-twister-like utterances involving repeated and
similar phonemes ("She sells socks in a small shoe shop"). While utterances involving
phonologically similar phonemes consistently give rise to speech errors, repeated phonemes
have been shown to interfere as well as to facilitate production. Here we try to shed light on this
paradox by investigating brain processes underlying planning utterances involving similar and
repeated phonemes (tongue-twister-like) and utterances with only repeated phonemes
elicited with picture naming during electroencephalographic/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP)
recording. Tongue-twister-like utterances increased error rates while repeated onset phonemes
decreased reaction times. Both types of utterances modulated ERPs after 370 ms following
picture onset by shortening a period of stable electrophysiological pattern. Another microstate
was lengthened for tongue-twister-like utterances only, wiping out the timing difference of the
previous microstate. These results indicate priming of repeated phonemes and cost of encoding
similar phonemes, both phenomena co-occurring in tongue-twisters.

Introduction
Every speaker has experienced the production of phonological errors while trying to recite speech sequences
involving similar and repeated phonemes such as "She
sells six socks in a small shoe shine shop". Besides the
funny tongue-twister experience, the observation that
error rate increases in the production of such sequences
questions the limits of our speech planning and production system. It also provides a unique opportunity to
understand the mechanisms underlying speech planning.
Tongue-twister-like sequences have been widely used in
psycholinguistic research to study the processes involved
in encoding the form of the utterances to be produced. In
the different paradigms used to elicit speech errors participants are asked to read aloud or to repeat speech
sequences involving both similar phonemes and
repeated phonemes. However, a paradox exists in the literature regarding the planning and production of
sequences with similar and repeated phonemes: while
phonologically similar phonemes consistently resulted
in increased production difficulty (Wilshire, 1999), the repetition of identical phonemes in consecutive words has
been shown to facilitate production (Damian & Dumay,
2009). Here we try to shed light on this paradox by investigating errors and event-related potentials (ERPs) during
the production of tongue-twister-like utterances

Speech errors; tonguetwister; language production;
facilitation; interference

involving both similar word onset phonemes and
repeated phonemes and comparing them to the production of utterances involving repeated onset phonemes. In addition, we get rid of reading and repetition
paradigms and elicit the production of tongue-twisterlike sequences with a picture naming task.

Error elicitation with similar and repeated
phonemes
Spontaneous and elicited speech errors (slips of the
tongue) have been analysed in (psycho)linguistic
research to draw inferences on the representations and
processes involved in speech production. Whereas the
initial systematic investigations of speech errors were
based on the observation of spontaneous errors
(Fromkin, 1973; Meringer & Mayer, 1896), Baars and
Motley (1974) were the first to try to elicit speech
errors in experimental settings. In their original paradigm
(SLIP, spoonerism of laboratory induced predisposition)
they asked the participants to silently read sequences
of word pairs. Every few trials a target word pair was presented with a signal asking the participants to produce
the words overtly. The word pairs preceding the target
pair had a fixed sequence of phonologically similar
word onset phonemes which was inversed in the

target pair (e.g. the target pair "bad goof" preceded by
"give book", "go back" and "gap boot"). In such cases
subjects are likely to produce an onset exchange error
("gad boof", Baars, Motley, & MacKay, 1975). Subsequently other paradigms have been developed to
elicit segmental errors. In the tongue-twister paradigm
multiple repetitions of tongue-twister-like sequences
are elicited (Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1992). Participants are
often asked to follow a rhythm imposed by a metronome
(Schwartz, Saffran, Bloch, & Dell, 1994) or encouraged to
repeat sequences as fast as possible (Sevald & Dell, 1994).
Wilshire (1999) carried out a detailed analysis of the conditions inducing the production of errors in the tonguetwister tasks, in which participants repeated sequences
of four words visually displayed on screen. Higher error
rates were observed when the four words in the sequences
involved two repeated onset phonemes which were
phonologically similar (e.g. "dirt bus boot dose"). Errors
increased from the second repetition of the word
sequences and were also observed when the four words
in the quadruplets were not recited sequentially but in
random order (Wilshire, 1999, Exp. 2). The influence of
the presence of repeated phonemes in error elicitation
has also been shown by Dell (1984) in a delayed production task of two word sequences. Error rates were
higher when the sequences involved repeated phonemes
than when they only involved different phonemes (e.g.
"mad back" vs. "mad bake") whether the repeated phonemes were adjacent to the similar word onset phonemes
or not (e.g. "boom comb" vs. "boom coat").
Hence, both phoneme repetition and presence of
similar onset phonemes seem to play a role in the production of speech errors in tongue-twisters and similar
reciting tasks. Increased error rates while repeating the
same utterances involving repeated phonemes is interpreted as the consequence of re-activating the same
phonemes. This difficulty arises either because phonemes are recalled from a previous selection/activation
which decayed in the meantime (Dell, 1988), or
because two units (e.g. syllables) containing the same
phoneme are activated via the shared phoneme and
compete for selection (Dell, 1984) or because a unit
is temporary inhibited after activation/selection to
prevent perseveration (Stemberger, 2009). On the
other hand, interference by phoneme similarity
suggests that phonologically similar phonemes
compete for activation/selection due to shared features. This observation favours phonological encoding
models claiming that features are represented and
activated along with segmental information (Dell,
1986, 1988). If shared features become activated, misselection of similar phonemes is more plausible than
errors on distant phonemes.

It should be noted that in these frameworks spontaneous or experimentally induced slips of the tongue
have been considered phonemic (categorical) substitutions. Slightly different interpretations are provided
by studies applying acoustic analyses to speech errors.
For instance, Frisch and Wright (2002) carried out acoustic analyses on /s/-/z/ errors produced in an experimental
tongue-twister task and reported both, intermediate
phonetic errors and phonemic errors. Hence, in addition
to the error mechanisms described above for categorical
substitutions, McMillan and Corley (2010) suggested that
a simultaneous activation of target and non-target phonemes can lead either to articulatory variations (phonetic
transformations) or to whole phoneme substitution
errors. Note however that this interpretation holds for
sequences of competing similar phonemes, not for
sequences of repeated onset phonemes.

Facilitation with repeated phonemes
As summarised above, tongue-twister-like sequences
involve both, similar phonemes and repeated phonemes
and the two seem to contribute to errors. Whereas
feature similarity between subsequent word onset consonants appears to be a key condition to elicit slips of
the tongue, producing sequences of words with
repeated phonemes has been shown to interfere with
(Stemberger, 2009; see also Breining, Nozari, & Rapp,
2015) but also to facilitate production (Meyer, 1992;
Roelofs, 1999). For instance, in a different vein and for
different goals than those pursued by tongue-twister
studies, Damian and Dumay (2009) showed that participants were faster to name pictures with adjectival
noun phrases when the adjective and the noun contained repeated onset phonemes (e.g. blue bag). The
same effect was replicated when phonemes were
repeated at different word positions (e.g. green chain).
Of interest for our purpose here is also the observation
that phoneme repetition did not affect error rates in
any direction in the studies reported by Damian and
Dumay. In addition, facilitation was not observed when
the participants produced the sequence after a delay,
suggesting that facilitation was not due to articulation,
but likely to the repeated activation/selection of the
same phonemes. Fact is that the facilitation reported
when the two consecutive words involve repeated phonemes seems at odds with the interpretation that
repeated phonemes contribute to errors in tongue-twisters. However, one should take the comparison of results
from tongue-twister studies with those of facilitation
using repeated phonemes with caution, as both the
paradigms and the linguistic materials diverge. First,
whereas reading and repetition are used to elicit

652

production in tongue-twister tasks, the phoneme repetition priming paradigms use picture naming tasks to
elicit utterance production. Second, the utterances
used in most tongue-twister studies are composed of
sequences of juxtaposed words, that is, of ungrammatical utterances; this is not the case in the repeated phonemes priming tasks, where the participants produce
adjectival noun phrases, that is, grammatical utterances.
Finally, whereas multiple repetitions of the same
sequences are elicited in the tongue-twister paradigms,
the utterance is not repeated (at least not immediately)
in picture naming paradigms.
There are thus core differences between the tonguetwister paradigms and the repeated onset phoneme
priming paradigms which do not allow us to further
discuss the discordant results and interpretations on
planning and producing repeated phonemes relative
to similar phonemes. In the present study we tried to disentangle facilitation from interference of repeated
phonemes by having the same subjects producing
tongue-twister-like adjectival noun phrases (involving
both similar phonemes and repeated phonemes) and
sequences involving repeated onset phonemes and
their respective control utterances in a picture naming
task. In addition to the behavioural analysis we take
advantage of ERP electrophysiological analyses and
track the time-course of the modulations related to
repeated and to similar phonemes. If encoding repeated
phonemes facilitates production, we should observe
reduced production latencies as in Damian and Dumay
(2009), which should reflect in ERP modulations in the
time window associated with phonological encoding.
On the other hand, tongue-twister-like sequences
should result in increased error rates and production
latencies. Regarding electrophysiological modulations
related to the production of tongue-twister-like
sequences, a very few ERP studies used the SLIP paradigms to elicit production errors with written word
sequences. Acheson and Hagoort (2014) were interested
in the error-related negativity rather than in the planning
processes and therefore analysed the post-response
ERPs. To our knowledge only Moller, Jansma, Rodriguez-Fornells, and Munte (2007) analysed the preresponse ERPs in a SLIP task. The authors reported diverging ERPs between erroneous and error-free trials, which
they interpreted as reflecting conflict during phonetic
planning. In our paradigm, if similar onset phonemes
and repeated phonemes both contribute to speech
errors, we should observe a similar ERP signature as
Moller et al. for tongue-twister-like and for repeated
onset phoneme utterances. Finally, if tongue-twisterlike sequences involve both facilitation due to repeated
phonemes and interference due to phonologically

similar phonemes, we should observe two distinct ERP
modulations, one being similar to the modulation in
the repeated phoneme task.

Method
Participants
Twenty-two undergraduate students from the University
of Geneva (six men) were recruited for this study. They
were all native French speakers, right-handed (as confirmed by the Edinburgh Handedness Scale, Oldfield,
1971), aged between 20 and 34 (mean: 24.5). They did
not report hearing or language disorders. The participants filled a written informed consent and were paid
for their participation.

Material
Tongue-twister task
Twenty-four nouns and their corresponding line drawings
were selected from two French databases (Alario &
Ferrand, 1999; Bonin, Peereman, Malardier, Meot, &
Chalard, 2003). The words were three to eight phoneme
long (one to three syllables), all with a consonant onset.
Each noun was associated with two out of six prenominal adjectives (petit -small-, grand -big-, trois -
three-, quatre -four-, demi -half-, vieux -old-) to create
tongue-twister-like adjectival noun phrases with phonologically similar onset phonemes and the respective control
sequences. The six pre-nominal adjectives were chosen to
meet the condition of being easily represented in a
picture naming task and of creating a possible tonguetwister-like sequence by manipulating the phoneme similarity with the nouns. Accordingly, the original linedrawing images (350 x 350 pixels) were modified with
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program, http://www.
gimp.org) to elicit adjectival noun phrases for each of
the six adjectives (see examples in the Appendix).
The 24 tongue-twister-like adjectival noun phrases
were built such that the noun onset and the adjective
onset differed on one phonological feature and at least
one phoneme was shared between the noun and the
adjective (e.g. la grande cravate /lagRadkRavat/ -the big
tie-). Every two tongue-twister-like sequences, two
control sequences were created by rotating the two
adjectives. In this way, a noun was used both in the
experimental condition and in the control condition
with a different adjective from the same set of six prenominal adjectives and all adjectives were repeated an
equal amount of times in the experimental and the
control utterances. The matched control utterances did
not involve similar or identical phoneme onsets. An
example of "quadruplet" is given in Table 1(a).

Repeated onset phoneme task
Twenty-four additional nouns and their corresponding
line drawings were selected from the same databases.
The 24 items were matched with those used for
tongue-twisters on the following psycholinguistic variables: visual complexity of the picture, concept familiarity, image agreement, name agreement, lexical
frequency, age of acquisition, word length (as number
of phonemes and as number of syllables). Each noun
was associated with two out of six pre-nominal adjectives (same adjectives as for tongue-twister sequences)
such that the noun and the adjective shared the same
onset consonant. For every two repeated phoneme
sequences, two control sequences were constructed by
rotating the adjectives in order to create adjective-
noun sequences with different onsets (control condition,
see examples in Table 1(b)).
Five additional nouns were selected for the examples
and as filler items.

presented without the written utterance and participants
were asked to name the pictures with the expected
adjectival noun phrase with an increasingly pressing
timing. This procedure guaranteed that each participant
knew and used the expected adjectives and nouns for
each pictures during the experiment. An experimenter
ensured that each subject performed the task as
intended before the actual experiment was run.
During the experimental phase, each stimulus was
presented on the screen for 1500 ms, preceded by a
cross in the middle of the screen lasting 500 ms and a
blank screen of 200 ms. Inter-stimuli interval (ISI) lasted
1000 ms. Participants were instructed to respond (to
name each picture with the adjectival noun phrase) as
fast and accurately as possible. Each block of 96 stimuli
started with 3 filler trials and a short break was taken
between the 2 blocks. E-prime (Psychology Software
Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA; http://www.pstnet.com/
eprime) was used for stimulus presentation and timing
of stimuli.

Analysis of behavioural data

The participants sat approximately 60 cm away from the
computer screen. Pictures were presented in constant
size of 9.26 x 9.26 cm (approximately 4.4 of visual angle)
on a grey screen. The stimuli from the tongue-twister
task and the repeated phoneme task were mixed up to
increase variation and presented twice in 2 blocks of 96
pseudo-randomised stimuli. Four different orders were
used and counterbalanced across participants.
Before the experiment, participants were familiarised
with each original line-drawing and with the modified
pictures eliciting the adjectival noun phrases. At first
each original drawing appeared on the screen with the
expected noun. The stimuli appeared in a random
order and the participants could proceed at their pace
by pressing a key after having named the picture according to the label provided. Then two object pictures (not
belonging to the experimental set) appeared combined
with each of the six possible modifications to elicit
the six adjective-noun combinations. Pictures were presented with the expected adjectival noun phrases and
the participants were asked to read them aloud. During
the second familiarisation phase, pictures were

Every produced utterance was digitised and the CheckVocal software (Protopapas, 2007) was used to manually
extract production latencies (response times or RTs, i.e.
the time separating the onset of the picture and the
vocal onset) based on the acoustic waveforms. Every production which did not correspond to the expected
correct sequence was considered as error. The following
error categories were identified: lexical errors (e.g. other
nouns or adjectives than expected), segmental errors
(e.g. /lakRadkRavat/ for /lagRadkRavat/, or /letRwabiRbo/
for /letRwabibRo/) and other errors (e.g. lack of answer,
determiner omission or gender error, interrupted or
incomplete answer, laughter, guttural sounds, dysfluencies). Production errors were transcribed and coded by
the first author and cross-checked by the second
author. In case of disagreement between the two
judges, a consensus was found with a third rater.

EEG acquisition and pre-processing
A high density continuous electroencephalographic (EEG)
(128 channels covering the entire scalp) was acquired at
512 Hz (filters: DC to 104 Hz, 3 dB/octave slope) using
the ActiveTwo Biosemi system (Biosemi V.O.F. Amsterdam,
Netherlands, http://www.biosemi.com). The common
mode sense (CMS; active electrode) - driven right leg
(CMS-DRL) was the online reference. Afterwards, EEG
epochs with amplitudes exceeding 100 V and containing eye blinks or other noise were rejected before further
analyses and averaging, using the CarTool software
(Brunet, Murray, & Michel, 2011). Band-pass filters

654

E. MONACO ET AL.

between 0.2 and 30 Hz and the notch filter at 50 Hz were
applied and stimulus-aligned epochs and responsealigned epochs corresponding to correct productions or
to production classified as segmental errors were
extracted. Stimulus-aligned epochs covered the time
period from picture onset to 500 ms (forward direction);
response-aligned epochs were locked 100 ms before the
vocal onset of each trial and covered from -300 to
-100 ms before the onset of the response acoustic
signal (backward direction). Only trials for which both
stimulus-aligned and response-aligned ERPs were artefact
free were retained, then averaged separately per participant, task (tongue-twister-like and repeated onset phonemes) and per condition (experimental and matched
control utterances). A minimum of 30 epochs were averaged per participant and condition (mean = 38.2 epochs,
SD = 4.1). Bad channels were interpolated with a 3D
spline interpolation method (Perrin, Pernier, Bertnard,
Giard, & Echallier, 1987). For the spatio-temporal analysis
the overlapping signal between stimulus-locked and
response-locked ERP according to participant's mean production latencies in each condition was removed (see
details in the next section).

ERP analyses
In order to identify time periods in which amplitude
differences were present between the tongue-twisterlike condition and its control condition, and between
the phoneme repetition condition and its control condition, a standard waveform analysis was performed on
the averaged ERPs of the participants. At each electrode
and for each time point, the amplitudes of the evoked
potentials were compared across conditions with a parametric repeated measures ANOVA using STEN (Statistical
Toolbox for Electrical Neuroimaging1). This analysis was
performed on the stimulus-aligned time periods and
on the response-aligned time periods independently.
The experimental conditions and their corresponding
control sequences for the tongue-twister-like and the
repeated phoneme utterances were analysed separately
and a correction of the alpha criterion to 0.025 was
applied in addition to a spatial criterion of five neighbouring electrodes displaying ERP differences and a temporal criterion of five consecutive time frames (10 ms).
If any difference on amplitudes is indeed to be found
across conditions, the waveform amplitude analysis does
not indicate per se if this difference would be due to
simple modulations in amplitudes, to different underlying brain functional states or to shifts of the ERP components across conditions (Michel & Murray, 2012). To
gain additional information on the underlying electrophysiological differences, a topographic analysis was
run. The aim of this analysis is to identify periods of

stable global electric fields, likely corresponding to particular periods in mental information processing (Changeux & Michel, 2004; Koukkou & Lehmann, 1987;
Lehmann, Strik, Henggeler, Koenig, & Koukkou, 1998)
and to compare them across tasks. The advantages of
tracking global topographic configurations are related
to their reference-independence and to their direct link
to changes in the configuration of the intracranial
sources (Michel, Koenig, Brandeis, & Gianotti, 2009).
Thus, the analyses of global electrophysiological patterns
provide insights into how tasks differ in terms of likely
underlying neurophysiological mechanisms (Michel &
Murray, 2012; Murray, Brunet, & Michel, 2008), in addition
to the temporal information about ERP differences.
At first, a non-parametric randomisation test to the
global dissimilarity between two electric fields was
carried out. This analysis, called "TANOVA" was carried
out to identify time point by time point periods of significant topographic differences between conditions
using the CarTool software (Brunet et al., 2011). The
global dissimilarity is a quantification of topographic
differences between two electric fields independent of
their strength ranging from 0 to 2 (Lehmann & Skrandies, 1980, see an example of its computation in
Murray et al., 2008). The permutation of the data is
accomplished by re-assigning randomly the topographic maps of single subjects to the different conditions. The global dissimilarity of these random
group-averaged ERPs is compared time point by time
point with the values of topographic dissimilarity of
the actual tasks. A time period criterion of 10 ms of consecutive significant differences was applied.
Subsequently, a spatio-temporal segmentation was
performed on the participants grand-averaged ERPs
per task and condition to determine topographic differences across conditions and statistically validate them
in the responses of single participants. In order to determine the most dominant electric field configurations at
the scalp (topographic ERP maps), we used a modified
hierarchical clustering algorithm (Murray et al., 2008),
the agglomerative hierarchical clustering and a combination of a cross-validation and the Krzanovski-Lai criterion (see Murray et al., 2008) to select the optimal
number of ERP topographic maps that best explain the
group-averaged data across conditions. Statistical
smoothing was applied to remove temporally isolated
topographic maps with low explanatory power. The
same time criterion used for the ERP waveform analyses
was adopted (minimum duration of 10 ms). The pattern
of topographic map templates observed in the groupaveraged data was statistically tested by comparing
each of these map templates with the moment-bymoment scalp topography of individual ERPs in each

condition. The aim of this procedure (called "fitting") was
to establish how well a topographic template map
explains single participant responses in each condition.
For this analysis, stimulus and response-aligned ERPs
were combined on the basis of each participant's mean
production latency in each condition, by removing the
overlapping signal from the response-aligned ERPs.
This procedure was designed to obtain ERPs covering
the exact time window of encoding, from picture onset
to 100 ms before the initiation of articulation (Laganaro,
2014) for each participant and condition. Each data
sampling point in each condition was labelled according
to the template map with which it best correlated
spatially, yielding a measure of map presence in each
individual data, its duration (number of time frames)
and the global explained variance (GEV). These measures
are then used to statistically test topographic differences
across experimental conditions.

Results
Four participants were excluded from the analyses due
to high amounts of lexical errors, and/or to lack of sufficient uncontaminated ERP epochs. The following analyses were performed on 18 participants.

Behavioural results
For latency and ERP analyses, RTs beyond three standard
deviations with respect to the average of the subject
across all the utterances (1.6% of the data) and errors
(9.5% of the data) were excluded from the analyses.
The average naming latency and mean error rate per
task and condition are displayed in Table 2. Mixed
effects models were computed separately on each task
on RTs and on errors (generalised mixed effect model)
with experimental conditions as fixed effect and by
subject and by-item adjustments to the intercept for
the random structure (conducted with the statistical software R, R Development Core Team, 2007, version 3.2.4.,
and the packages lme4 and lmerTest, Bates, Maechler,
Bolker, & Walker, 2014). No significant differences were
observed on RTs between the tongue-twister and the
control conditions (t(1402) = -1.21, p = .23), but RTs
were significantly shorter in the repeated onset

655

phoneme experimental as compared to the control
sequences (t(1453) = -2.07, p = .038).
In the error analysis there was no significant difference
across conditions on overall error rates (tongue-twisters: z
= 1.51, p = .13; repeated phonemes: z = -1.38, p = .17),
but the rate of segmental errors was significantly larger
on the tongue-twister stimuli than on the control stimuli
(z = 3.06, p < .01), with no difference across conditions
for the repeated phonemes (z < 1).

ERP results
Waveform analyses
The comparison between waveforms in the tonguetwister-like and the matched control utterances revealed
significant differences in amplitudes on a large cluster of
central electrodes in four time windows: between 20
and 40 ms, from 375 to 390 ms and from 410 to
430 ms after stimulus onset, and between 190 and
155 ms before articulation onset (see Figure 1(a), top).
Significant differences are also found on the global dissimilarity (TANOVA) in the same time windows, with
the exception of the very first one.
Across repeated phoneme experimental and control
utterances significant amplitude differences were
observed in the time windows from 95 to 115 ms and
between 460 and 490 ms on a cluster of central-posterior
electrodes. A short time window of significant TANOVA
was observed only in the 100-120 ms time window
(see Figure 1(b)).
Global topographic ERP pattern analysis (spatiotemporal segmentation)
A spatio-temporal segmentation analysis was run on the
four grand-averaged ERPs corresponding to tonguetwister and to repeated phoneme sequences and their
respective control sequences. The same sequence of
seven topographic maps was revealed for each condition of the two tasks (see Figure 2), accounting for
the 98% of the explained variance. Based on the
results of the waveform analysis and of the spatio-temporal segmentation, a fitting procedure was run from
310 ms until the end of the response-locked ERP
signals (100 ms before articulation onset) with map
templates "E", "F" and "G". The period of quasi-stable
global electrophysiological pattern at scalp labelled
map "E" was present in the ERPs of 16 out of 18 participants, and map "F" appeared in all participants' ERPs,
whereas the last period (map "G") was less consistent
across participants. The mean duration of each period
of topographic stability is displayed in Figure 2. A significant interaction between map and condition was
observed for the tongue-twister task on duration and

significant on GEV only (duration: F(1, 17) = 3.15, p

sequences (duration: t(17) = -2.45, p = .025; GEV: t(17)

= -1.69, p = .1), while no significant difference appeared
on map "F" across experimental and control sequences
(duration: t(17) = 1.14, p = .27; GEV: t(17) = 1.62, p = .12).

Discussion
The experimental manipulation of tongue-twister-like
adjectival noun phrases in a picture naming task actually
elicited a higher rate of segmental errors relative to the
control utterances, without differences in production
latencies. On the other hand, utterances with repeated
onset phonemes were produced 15 ms faster than
their matched control sequences but did not elicit
additional errors. In both tasks the experimental manipulation modulated waveform amplitudes and duration of
periods of topographic stability in late time windows,
after 375 ms post picture onset. Crucially, the period of

stable electrophysiological pattern starting around
270 ms after picture onset (map "E" in Figure 2) lasted
shorter for both, tongue-twister and repeated phonemes
relative to their control utterances, whereas the following
period (map "F") was lengthened for tongue-twisters
only. In the following we will first discuss interference
and facilitation separately before attempting an integration of the two phenomena.

Tongue-twister interference
A similar global error rate was observed on tonguetwister-like utterances and on their respective control
utterances, indicating that the experiment did not

create a general interfering condition in tonguetwister-like adjectival noun phrases. Only segmental
errors were more frequent on the tongue-twister-like
utterances than on their corresponding control utterances. The rate of segmental errors (2.3%) was nevertheless lower than in the standard SLIP or tongue-twister
paradigms. This is likely due to different eliciting tasks
(picture naming vs. reading or repetition), different utterances (adjectival noun phrases vs. ungrammatical
sequences in the SLIP paradigms) and different production conditions (iterations of the same utterance at
high production speed in the SLIP and in previous
tongue-twister tasks). Thus, adjectival noun phrases containing both similar onsets and at least one repeated

658

E. MONACO ET AL.

phoneme elicited with a picture naming task increase
segmental errors but to a lesser extent than the standard
SLIP tasks.
Despite increased error rates, the similar response
latencies between tongue-twister-like utterances and
control utterances indicate that overall the participants
did not take more time to plan the tongue-twisters.
However, if based on the behavioural results one
would claim that the planning time is similar for
tongue-twister-like and control sequences, a different
interpretation can be made based on the ERP spatiotemporal results, where the experimental manipulation
resulted in both lengthening and shortening of two consecutive periods of stable topographic patterns. This
period of stable global electrophysiological pattern "E"
started around 270-280 ms in both conditions and
lasted longer in the control than in the experimental condition, causing a shift between maps "E" and "F" around
400 ms, that is, in the time window of different waveform
amplitudes between experimental and control utterances. The subsequent microstate (map "F") displayed
the opposite pattern, longer duration for the tonguetwister-like condition than for the control utterances.
These two microstates had different duration across conditions, but in opposite directions, which seems to equal
out the overall processing time across conditions. These
results thus seem to indicate that the tongue-twister
manipulation speeds up the brain processes engaged
between 270 and 400 ms, but it lengthens the following processing. The latter likely reflects increased planning cost due to conflict between similar and/or
repeated phonemes and is consistent with Moller
et al.'s (2007) results and with usual interpretations of
the SLIP effect. Moller et al. reported a frontocentral
negativity from 350 ms after stimulus onset when the
word pairs elicited speech errors. The authors interpreted
their results as a conflict during phonetic encoding.
Whereas the Moller et al. results refer to the timecourse in a word pair reading task, the time period of
map "F" in the present study (after 400 ms) has been
associated with word form encoding and internal monitoring in previous estimates of the time-course in picture
naming tasks (Indefrey, 2011; see also Laganaro, Python,
& Toepel, 2013). There are at least two plausible explanations for the observed effect on duration of map "F".
The first interpretation is related to the timing of phonological-phonetic encoding, which might be lengthened
in case of similar phonemes either because of a conflict
between phonemes sharing common features or
because non-target phonemes have to be inhibited. An
alternative interpretation for a longer lasting period of
topographic stability in this late time window can be
associated with internal monitoring. The similarity of

the onset phonemes to be encoded might not slow
down the encoding process per se, but it might require
additional monitoring time to ensure that the production
is error-free. The two interpretations are not exclusive,
and we will not be able to disentangle them with the
present data. On the other hand, the same interpretation
cannot be extended to the results on map "E", as a similar
pattern was observed for the phoneme repetition task. A
different interpretation has to be searched for the shorter
period of topographic stability between 270 and 400 ms
which holds for both tasks. These two parallel results will
be discussed in the final section.

Facilitation by phoneme repetition
The repeated onset phonemes decreased production
latencies, thus replicating previous behavioural results
by Damian and Dumay's (2007, 2009). Planning two consecutive words starting with the same phoneme is
speeded up possibly because phoneme repetition
primes the selection/activation during phonological
encoding (Meyer, 1992; Roelofs, 1999). Repeated phonemes did not increase error rates in the current experiment, which seems to contradict previous results on
increased error rates for sequences involving repeated
phonemes (Dell, 1984, exp. 2). It should be noted that
in the present study repeated phonemes were all on
word onset positions and this is also the word position
in which errors mostly occurred in previous studies.
However, whereas previous studies involved mainly
monosyllabic words, our French stimuli were composed
of plurisyllabic nouns, thus enabling errors on other
word positions.
Besides amplitude differences on a small cluster of
channels in the P100 time window, possibly due to
more complex pictures in one condition, amplitudes differed between experimental and control utterances on a
large cluster of centro-posterior-right channels from 460
to 500 ms after picture onset. This time window corresponds to the end of the quasi-stable topographic
pattern "E" which was shorter in the repeated
phoneme adjectival noun phrases relative to the corresponding control utterances.2 The result on the duration
of periods of stable electrophysiological pattern closely
matches the shorter RTs in the experimental condition.
As reminded above, the time period corresponding to
map "E" has been associated with word form encoding
in picture naming (Indefrey, 2011). Here it suggests
that encoding the same word onset phoneme twice
speeds up phonological encoding. The time window of
ERP modulation by repeated phonemes in the present
study is later than the one observed for repeated onset
phonemes in picture naming by Yu, Mo, and Mo

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

(2014). The authors reported diverging ERP waveforms
between repeated onset phonemes and the control condition from about 180 to 300 ms. However, the linguistic
stimuli are different from ours. In the study by Yu et al.
(2014), two nouns corresponding to two different pictures were named consequently, while in the present
study phoneme repetition is manipulated within the
adjectival noun phrase elicited from a single picture.
Although Yu, Mo and Mo also interpreted their early
effect as reflecting phonological encoding, it is possible
that the underlying mechanisms of onset phonemes
priming and the overall dynamic of speech planning is
different for two consecutive object names relative to
adjectival noun phrases. More crucially for the purpose
of the present research, similar late waveform modulations after 400 ms on central-posterior electrodes and
similar shortening of the same period of topographic
stability were observed in the tongue-twister and in
the phoneme repetition condition, although the first
manipulation interfered with the correct production
and the second manipulation facilitated production by
reducing naming latencies.

Linking facilitation and interference
The crucial issue we wished to address is related to the
usual presence of both similar and repeated phonemes
in tongue-twister sequences. The similarity in the
results on the shortening of a shared period of stable
topographic configuration in both tasks allows us to
propose an interpretation of the processes involved
in the production of tongue-twister sequences. The
period corresponding to map "E" which is shortened in
both, repeated phonemes and tongue-twister-like
sequences, likely reflects phoneme priming across adjective and noun during phonological encoding, whichever
the position of the repeated phonemes.
In the tongue-twister task the priming is unlikely due
to shared features between phoneme onsets as similar
onset phonemes do not seem to be a valid priming condition in word production (see Roelofs, 1999). The effect
observed on map "E" being similar between tonguetwister and repeated onset phoneme sequences, it is
likely due to repeated phonemes, although in other positions than word onset in the tongue-twister-like utterances. Behavioural facilitation by repeated phonemes
in other word positions in adjectival noun phrases has
been reported previously (see Exps. 4 and 5 in Damian
& Dumay, 2009). Hence, the ERP results indicate some
amount of facilitation on processing speed in the
tongue-twister utterances, which cannot be observed
in the behavioural results, where only interference in
terms of errors is observed. However, we also observed

659

that RTs are not increased in the tongue-twister condition. This seems to be due to a compensation of facilitation by the cost of conflict due to similar onset
phonemes as identified in the longer duration for the
tongue-twister-like condition of the period of electrophysiological stability labelled map "F". Fact is that the
present results provide evidence that interference is
not the only mechanism at play in the production of
tongue-twister-like sequences, which is rather a situation
in which the speaker is submitted to both, facilitation
and interference. It is possible that both contribute to
speech errors, priming of identical phonemes increasing
the conflict with similar sounding phonemes.

2. Notice that the ERP amplitude modulation by the experimental conditions at the end of the stimulus-aligned
ERP signal appears later than in the tongue twister like
task. In both cases the divergences in amplitudes in
this late time window likely reflect the delay in the transitions from maps "E" to "F" across conditions. This delay
seems to happen earlier for the tongue-twister like task
than for the phoneme repetition task. We statistically
compared the onset of map "F" in the experimental condition across tasks and it actually happens to be earlier
for tongue-twister like than for repeated phonemes
(t(17) = -2.01, p = .05).
