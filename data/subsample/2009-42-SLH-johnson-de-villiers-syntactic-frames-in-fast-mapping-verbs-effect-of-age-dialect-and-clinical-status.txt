Purpose: To investigate children's performance on a fast mapping task. Possible
effects across age, dialect group, and clinical status were explored.
Method: Participants between the ages of 4 and 9 saw a series of pictured events
and heard novel verbs. The novel verbs were in intransitive, transitive, dative, and
complement syntactic frames or argument structures. The children then had to answer
questions about the novel verbs that revealed what meaning they had attached to
them. The field-testing of a new assessment instrument provided the data for typically
developing children and children with language impairment from 2 linguistic
communities: (a) mainstream American English speaking and (b) African American
English speaking. Strict criteria were used for the 529 participants that defined both
their clinical and dialect status.
Results: There were significant effects of age and clinical status on the participants'
ability to fast map a novel verb from its argument structure, but no significant effects
for dialect.
Conclusions: Regardless of dialect, children with specific language impairment have
difficulty using syntactic frames to identify a likely meaning of a novel verb. In
addition, the syntactic frames are differentially difficult, with complement structures
being particularly hard.

he theory of syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman, 1990) was developed to explain the process by which young children use their knowledge of language to acquire verb meaning. Unlike concrete nouns,
the referents of verbs are transient, and often abstract (Maratsos, Fox, &
Becker, 1985). In addition, even if the verb is concrete, oftentimes hearing
the verb does not coincide with the time of the occurrence of the act
involved (Tomasello & Akhtar, 2003). Furthermore, events are perceptually complex, often with more than one potential actor and action, so
the sentence frame provides a crucial clue to what a verb might refer to
(Gleitman, 1990).
There are several kinds of clues available from the surrounding
language that help a child identify a word as a verb. First, there are
morphological clues that define the part of speech of an unknown word.
For verbs, these would include such cues as past tense /-ed/, present progressive /-ing/, and third person singular /-s/, in contrast to nouns, which
take plural /-s/, and initial determiners, or quantifiers. Valian (1986)
showed, by analyzing transcripts of very young children, that they respect
the distributional regularities that differentiate parts of speech. However, there are potential ambiguities using morphology alone. For example, third person singular /-s/ is the same form as plural /-s/, progressive
/-ing/ is the same ending as /-ing/ on a gerund, and /-ed/ can occur on

adjectives. Therefore, morphology alone is insufficient
as a clue to the status of a word as a verb. Furthermore,
there are dialects of English that have variable morphology; African American English (AAE) has variability in the plural /-s/, past tense /-ed/, and third person
singular /-s/, often using an unmarked form in such cases.
The second kind of clue is from syntax, in other
words, the sentence frame that surrounds the unknown
verb. Not only do the surrounding words help define a
word as a verb, but also there are systematic correlations
between the form of the sentence frame or syntactic frame
and the possible meaning of an unknown verb that a child
could exploit to narrow the range of possible meanings.
For instance, there is a fundamental contrast between
intransitive and transitive verb frames. Intransitive verbs
have a single argument that is the subject, and that subject is the agent or initiator of an action that is typically
noncausal. For example, verbs such as sneeze, jump, or
bark have no direct effect on an object or patient (e.g., "The
man sneezed"). Transitive verbs have two arguments--
a subject and an object, and the subject typically has a
causal relation to the object. Typical cases would be verbs
such as hit, caress, or pull (e.g., "The boy hit the baseball").
Dative frames have three arguments: (a) a subject, (b) an
object, and (c) an indirect object. Such frames are associated with verbs that indicate the transfer of an item
from subject to indirect object, such as give, send, or hand
(e.g., "The woman handed the envelope to the boy"). A
fourth frame of some importance arises with verbs that
can take a complement structure, that is, an embedded
sentence. These verbs belong to a restricted meaning
class having to do with communication or mental state,
such as think, believe, say, or want (e.g., "The girl wanted
the man to stop the car"). In such a sentence, there is a
subject argument and then one to three arguments in a
lower clause around another verb.
Researchers (e.g., Fisher, 1996; Gleitman, 1990;
Naigles, 1990) have investigated whether children can
use these differences in argument structure to narrow
down the meaning of a novel verb. Several studies have
demonstrated that young children can figure out the
kind of event that is being referred to in an utterance
with an unknown verb on the basis of how many arguments it has. For example, Fisher (1996) tested whether
children could use the distinction between transitive
(two arguments) and intransitive (one argument) syntactic frames to determine which one was causal (a property of a transitive frame). Three- to 5-year-old children
watched a video of Person A sitting on a swivel stool, being spun by Person B, who was pulling off a scarf wrapped
around the waist of Person A. The children heard a sentence with either a transitive (a) or intransitive (b) argument frame accompanying the scene:
(a) She's mooping her over there.
(b) She's mooping over there.

For sentence (a), children most often chose the action
of Person A, not Person B. As with adults, the intransitive syntactic frame was actually ambiguous between
the actions of Persons A and B. Naigles (1990), Fisher
(1996), and Gleitman and colleagues (Gleitman, 1990;
Gleitman & Gleitman, 1992) have conducted studies that
demonstrated that children are sensitive to the verb
meaning differences associated with intransitive and
transitive syntactic frames.
In the last several years, scholars have raised the
issue of the potential problems a child with specific language impairment (SLI) might face in learning verbs
from their sentential contexts. To the extent that verb
learning is more dependent than noun learning on linguistic clues, a child with SLI might face an additional
disadvantage in the learning of verbs. This gains significance if tasks on novel verb learning could be used as
process measures to assist in diagnosis. There is extensive evidence that verbs pose particular difficulty in SLI,
with effects on the verb lexicon. In the Quick Incidental Learning paradigm pioneered by Rice and colleagues
(e.g., Oetting, Rice, & Swank, 1995; Rice, 1990; Rice, Buhr,
& Oetting, 1992), children with SLI have been shown to
have more difficulty retaining novel verbs used multiple times in a video sequence. More recent work has addressed the question of the use that children with SLI
can make of morphology and syntactic frames in the
acquisition of a novel verb from linguistic context. An
early study by van der Lely (1994) tested six children
between 6 and 9 years of age with SLI and found that
they did less well than language-matched control participants on a test in which they had to act out novel verbs
acquired through the linguistic context of reversible transitive sentences (e.g., "The girl kalls the boy") or locatives
(e.g., "The car rits the train to the lorry").
In another study, O'Hara and Johnston (1997) expanded the frame varieties to also include coordinated
transitive frames (e.g., "The bunny bims the farmer and
the cow") and confirmed van der Lely's (1994) results
with six 7-year-old children with SLI. However, Oetting
(1999) pointed out that the memory and executive function demands of these tasks may have obscured an intact
underlying ability to use the syntactic frames to determine verb meaning. Hoff-Ginsberg, Kelly, and Buhr
(1996) found children with SLI to be competent on a
task with a locative frame that made fewer demands on
memory because it contained semantic clues (e.g., "The
giraffe goes the lion to the ramp"). Oetting (1999) chose to
ask her participants to tell a puppet the meaning of the
novel verb instead of having children act it out, and because the event stayed on a video screen, memory demands were minimized. In her study, twenty 6-year-old
children with SLI were compared with age- and languagematched control children (4 years old) in their ability to
extract meaning of novel verbs from intransitive (e.g.,

"The monkey is kibbing") or transitive (e.g., "The bear
is kibbing the monkey") syntactic frames. The events
depicted were known actions, such as eating, chasing, or
sliding. The child was then asked what the nonce verb
meant and was prompted with a binary choice if no response was given ("Do you think kibbing means eating
or feeding?"). Both the typically developing (TD) children and children with SLI were more likely to give an
intransitive-type meaning (eat) when the verb was presented in a single argument frame and more likely to
give a transitive-type meaning (feed) if the verb was presented in a two-argument frame. There were no group
differences, suggesting that children with SLI may not
have difficulties in fast mapping per se. The second part
of Oetting's study utilized Quick Incidental Learning
and found that the children with SLI did have problems
retaining novel verbs even after multiple repetitions of
the video. There is, therefore, genuine controversy over
whether there is a problem with how the children with
SLI use sentence frames or just a problem of memory or
storage of novel verbs.
Eyer et al. (2002) tested whether children with SLI
could use critical morphosyntactic information to identify a novel word as a verb, such as "Watch this one tiv"
(syntax alone) or "Every day it tivs" (syntax and morphology). The correct choice was a novel action performed
by a familiar character, and the foil was an unknown
object. The participants were eight children 3 to 5 years
old, with SLI, and language-matched control children
who were, on average, 18 months younger. All of the children performed above chance levels, and there was no
special difficulty for the children with SLI. However, because the frame was intransitive (single argument) and
the familiar subject was already known, the children
might simply have been using inference, not morphosyntax, to guess the verb meaning. Eyer et al.'s second
experiment removed this confound, so that children had
to use the morphosyntax as a clue to meaning. A novel
object performed a novel action, and the experimenter
produced critically different sentence frames, such as
"It's ready to kiv" (for a verb) and "Let's see the kiv" (for a
noun). They reported that all groups of children showed
difficulty in identifying the novel form as a verb using
morphosyntactic clues alone, with no special difficulty
arising for children with SLI. Eyer et al. argued that
even for TD children in the preschool years, a single morphological clue cannot be used to classify a novel word as
a verb.
In sum, the existing literature shows mixed results
on whether children with SLI have difficulties in using
syntactic frames to assist them in identifying the possible meaning of a novel verb. The studies either suggest
no difference in verb learning (Eyer et al., 2002, Study 2;
Oetting, 1999, Study 1), or they contain a confound of
memory load, task demands, or extra clues (Eyer et al.,

612

2002, Study 1; Hoff-Ginsburg et al., 1996). Only two studies (van der Lely, 1994, and O'Hara & Johnston, 1997)
have shown a difference in the use of fast mapping, and
they each had very small samples. Oetting's (1999) results suggest that the problem may be not in fast mapping
but in retention of what is learned. It is clear from Eyer
et al.'s (2002) research that preschool children need
more than a single morphological clue, but perhaps they
need a syntactic frame as well. However, the range of
sentence frames explored has typically been limited to
intransitive (to contrast nouns and verbs) or a contrast
between intransitive and transitive frames (to contrast
types of verb meaning).
Johnson (2001) studied a broader range of frames
that also included dative and complement structures
that each had three argument positions. Gleitman and
colleagues (e.g., Fisher, Hall, Rakowitz, & Gleitman, 1994)
have conducted several experiments with adults showing that they guess a mental-type verb from a blank in a
complement context, but before Johnson's study no experimental work had been done with children on this
topic. In addition, Johnson was interested in whether
children who speak AAE have the same ability to fast
map verbs from sentence context as their mainstream
American English (MAE)-speaking counterparts, if the
morphology were dialect neutral. Her participants were
30 AAE-speaking children and 30 MAE-speaking children between 4 and 6 years of age.
Johnson (2001) modeled her design after Fisher's
(1996) work to include these more complex forms. Johnson
used four argument structures judged to be the same
across the two dialects: (a) intransitive, (b) transitive,
(c) dative, and (d) infinitival complement frames. Johnson
used the same design as Naigles (1990) and Fisher (1996)
by pairing the argument structures with the same pictured stimuli: intransitive with transitive and to- complement with dative structures. However, instead of
using videos of novel actions, Johnson utilized sequential
picture sets to simulate a "movie" of the main event to be
presented to the participants. This was designed to allow the child to fix a meaning in the visual context and
not rely totally on his or her memory of the sentence.
For example, the set of three pictures might show a girl
beckoning to a boy, who then transfers a ball to her via a
flying device. Such an event might occasion either a focus on the communication (the beckoning) or the transfer, depending on the sentence frame used for the novel
verb:
(a) The girl is meeping the boy to send the flowers.
(complement)
(b) The boy is meeping the flowers to the girl. (dative)
Each participant was asked questions involving the novel
verb and presented with a set of four pictures to choose
from to determine which meaning the child extracted.

For example, the child might be asked "Which one is
meeping?", and the answer would be different depending on the argument frame, (a) or (b).
Johnson's (2001) results demonstrated first that
children between 4 and 6 years of age could use the argument structures to figure out the likely verb meaning
of the novel verbs. Furthermore, no significant differences
were found in performance between AAE-speaking children and MAE-speaking children in mapping novel verb
meanings.
Given the results from Johnson (2001), the purpose
of the present study was threefold: (a) to test whether
children with LI would show difficulties in fast mapping itself if the verbs were introduced via more complex
sentence frames, (b) to investigate how fast mapping
abilities emerge regardless of dialect across a broad age
range, and (c) to determine whether there are significant differences across syntactic frames of increasing
complexity.

Method
Research Design
We adapted Johnson's (2001) procedure and stimuli.
The sequential pictures from Johnson's study were redrawn, but the essential information was retained, and
the design remained the same for the Dialect Sensitive
Language Test (DSLT). The DSLT was developed as part

of a research contract among the National Institutes
of Health, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
and The Psychological Corporation (TPC). The sequential picture sets were used to simulate a movie of the
main event. The four argument structures represented
in the study were (a) intransitive ("The boy is temming"),
(b) transitive ("The clown is saiping the woman"), (c) dative ("The boy is meeping the flowers to the girl"), and
(d) complement ("The woman is ganning the waiter to
send the coffee") syntactic frames. Figures 1 through 4
provide examples of the picture sets of the four syntactic
frames presented to the participants.
The sequential picture sets were designed to prevent the participants from determining with certainty
the possible meaning of the novel verb, because two different actions were depicted in the pictures. The purpose
of each picture set was to provide an anchor for the participants' interpretation of the novel verb (e.g., temming)
and to reduce dependence on auditory memory.
The questions were designed to determine which
meaning the child mapped to the verb. For example, for
the stimulus sentence "The boy is temming," the question "Which one is the temmer?" would require the child
to identify the agent (e.g., the boy) doing a novel action in
the sentence. To do this successfully requires choosing
which novel action is referred to, and the sentence frame
is the clue. In addition, most questions incorporated
bound morphology to see whether children could handle the novel verb in a series of challenging questions,

because we wanted to cover the age range. There were a
total of six question types, as in Johnson's (2001) study.
The choice of questions was designed to avoid confounds
of AAE morphology, so, for example, the got passive "Which
one got meeped?" was used in questioning instead of the

be passive. The question types and examples with novel
verbs are listed in Table 1. It was not possible to use all
six questions with each syntactic frame; for example,
questions requiring a subject or object of the complement verb could not be asked for intransitive, transitive,

Participants
The data from this study were derived from the fieldtesting of the DSLT. Selected items from the subtests on
the DSLT subsequently became part of the Diagnostic
Evaluation of Language Variation: Criterion-Referenced,
Diagnostic Evaluation of Language Variation: Screening
Test, and Diagnostic Evaluation of Language Variation:
Norm Referenced (DELV: CR, DELV: ST, and DELV: NR,
respectively; Seymour, Roeper, & de Villiers, 2003a, 2003b,
2005).
The participants were 529 children between 4 and
9 years of age for whom data from all of the language
subtests from the DSLT were available. Two hundred
sixty-one were girls (146 AAE speaking and 115 MAE

speaking), and 268 were boys (145 AAE speaking and
123 MAE speaking). All of the children were reported as
having normal vision, hearing, and intelligence based
on information available provided from the school and
through field-testing by speech-language pathologists
(SLPs). In addition, the field-testing SLPs categorized
the children as MAE or AAE speakers on the basis of the
child's family and community background and their own
experience of the child's speech. A certified SLP at TPC
also conducted a post hoc linguistic confirmation of the
children's dialect status based on the presence or absence of distinctive morphological, phonological, syntactic, and semantic features in the children's verbatim
responses to DSLT items as recorded by the testing clinicians. The field-testing SLPs also provided an a priori
classification of the children as TD or language impaired
(LI) on the basis of their standard practices of assessment as defined by their school district. All of the children
diagnosed as LI were receiving intervention services.
Approximately 30% of each dialect group was classified
by the clinicians as language impaired.

is an age-dependent cutoff score provided in the
manual (Seymour et al., 2003b, p. 47)
Likewise, to be included as TD, the children had to be categorized by the testing clinicians as TD, and their performance had to fall into the "lowest risk" or "low risk"
categories on the diagnostic section of the DELV: ST.
Application of these criteria reduced the original sample

Procedure
All of the AAE speakers were African American, but
the MAE-speaking group was a mixture of ethnicities:
77.2% Caucasian, 15.1% Hispanic, 5.9% African American, and 2% other. The children were recruited from
four major regions of the United States, but most of them
were from the South (58.1%) and the north central states
(27.7%), with fewer from the Northeast (7.0%) and the
West (7.2%). This distribution was designed to match
approximately that of the distribution of the African
American population in the United States.

The sequential picture set was shown as the participant heard the stimulus sentence. After the stimulus
sentence was provided, each participant was required
to answer a series of questions by selecting the correct
choice from a set of four pictures. The four illustrations
were the people and items from the sequential picture
set and arranged in a multiple-choice format. Figures 1
through 4 provide examples of the sequential picture set
and the multiple-choice set for each syntactic frame. The
participants' task was to select the picture that best illustrated the answer to the question.

The participants from the DSLT were selected by
dialect and language status (TD vs. LI). For this study,
AAE classification was based on the following two criteria:
1.

The field-testing SLP identified the child as an AAE
speaker.

2.

The participants were identified by the DELV: ST as
an AAE speaker with a significant ("some" or "strong")
deviation from MAE (age-dependent criteria are provided in the manual; Seymour et al., 2003b, p. 46).

Using Figure 1 as an example, the potential ambiguity of a new verb's reference is between what the boy
is doing and what the woman is doing. Upon hearing
"The boy is temming," the child's options are delimited:
Temming must refer to the boy's action, not the woman's.
The child then is asked, for example, "Which one is the
temmer?" and must appropriately identify the boy as the
agent for credit. Then the three other questions from
Table 2 were asked. In addition, a foil item was asked
that justified the inclusion of one of the pictures (e.g.,
"Which one is the boy standing on?"). After all the questions for that verb were asked, the next verb would be
shown. As in Johnson's (2001) study, the task was introduced to the child using four real verbs (one for each syntactic frame). In this way, the child became familiar with

In addition, the participants' classification as LI
was based on the following two criteria:
1.

They were previously diagnosed as LI by the fieldtesting SLP and were receiving language services.

2.

Their performance on the DELV: ST fell within the
"highest risk for language disorder" category. This

the task and the questions before encountering novel
verbs. However, unlike Johnson's study, every participant heard only one sentence containing real verbs
for each syntactic frame, for a total of four real verbs:
one intransitive (bark), one transitive ( pour), one dative
(hand), and one complement (signal).
SLPs were recruited and trained by TPC as part of
the field-testing and administered the fast mapping task.
The administration of the task took place in the participant's school, or clinic if the child was receiving treatment. Each of the field-testing SLPs entered data on
specially designed score sheets provided by TPC. The
participants' choice of picture was marked for each item.
Once the SLP returned the record form, the data were
entered at TPC into a database. The data subsequently
were supplied to the researchers at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst.

Scoring
Children received one real verb example and two
novel verb examples for each syntactic frame; hence, a
total of four real verbs and eight novel verbs were presented to each participant. Each verb example, real or
novel, was associated with a number of questions with
different morphological/syntactic properties (see Table 2).
Therefore, each question received 1 point for scoring purposes when the expected response was provided. Because the required response was pointing to one of the
multiple-choice pictures, all responses were scored. A
response such as "I don't know" was counted as a failure
and scored as zero. An overall score for real and novel
verbs was created from all of the questions presented
to the participants for a total of 42 possible points. The
fast mapping score was composed of 28 possible points
(2 novel verbs per syntactic frame and 14 question-verb
type combinations). Twelve foil questions kept the child
on task and allowed easy answers (e.g., "What is the
girl wearing?"). These were scored but not used in the
analysis.

questions asked. The more important measure of fast
mapping was summed across only the novel verb tokens.
We first performed a univariate ANOVA first on
the measure of overall performance on the task, with the
between-subjects variables of clinical status, dialect, and
age in years. The results show a highly significant effect
of age, F(1, 504) = 16.75, p < .001, partial h2 = .142. Clinical status also made a highly significant difference in
overall performance, F(1, 504) = 93.422, p < .001, partial
h2 = .156. In contrast, dialect status did not make a significant difference, F(1, 504) = 2.88, p = .09, partial h2 =
.006. There were no significant interaction effects. The
means are shown in Tables 4 and 5.
We conducted the same ANOVA design with the fast
mapping performance (i.e., on the novel verbs only) as
the dependent measure. There was a highly significant
effect of age, F(5, 504) = 8.65, p < .001, partial h2 = .079;
and clinical status, F(1, 504) = 69.24, p < .001, partial
h2 = .121; but no effect of dialect, F(1, 504) = 1.94, p = .16,
partial h2 = .004; and only one significant interaction,
between clinical status and age, F(5, 504) = 2.4, partial
h2 = .023. See Tables 6 and 7 for the means.
We did not directly compare performance on real
versus novel verbs because only a single real verb for
each argument structure was used in the warm-up procedure. Instead, we used an analysis of covariance, with
the real verb score as the covariate, to explore effects of
clinical status, age, and dialect on the fast map score on
novel verbs only. The results show that even when the
task difficulty associated with answering the questions
with the real verbs is controlled for, there remains a
highly significant effect of clinical status on the fast map
measure, F(1, 504) = 8.17. p < .004, partial h2 = .02, but
no effect of age, F(5, 504) = 1.18, p = .316, partial h2 = .01,
or dialect, F(1, 504) = 2.8, p = .095, partial h2 = .006.
Two kinds of performance are intertwined: (a) Can
the participants map the meaning of the novel verb from
the single exposure? and (b) Can they answer questions

Results
The means of analyses of variance (ANOVAs) on the
overall performance of the participants and then on the
fast mapping measure (or the score of the novel verbs)
were examined to determine whether the children with
LI demonstrated difficulty with fast mapping in a variety of sentence frames. These scores combined the
individual tokens for the different question types and
argument structures. The overall score consisted of the
scores on both real verbs and novel verbs. This score allowed an assessment of how well the child could do the
task and attend to the form (e.g., the morphology) of the

that contain the novel verb and morphemic forms that
are still undergoing mastery in the youngest ages? For
example, Question Type 4 contains derivational morphology (/-able/), and Question Types 5 and 6 ask questions
stemming from the embedded complement, all of which
could pose independent difficulty to 4- and 5-year-olds
even with known verbs. In the next analysis, we compared the syntactic frames using the two questions that
are in common across them: Question Type 1 (contains
verbs inflected with /-ing/) and Question Type 2 (contains derivational /-er/) that target the agent of the verb.
The children demonstrated in the warm-up that they
understood these questions with the single real verb for
each syntactic frame. Any variation in answering these
questions across the novel verbs could then be attributed
to the information provided by the syntactic frames. We
asked whether children show different degrees of difficulty
across the four syntactic frames matched for the type of
questions asked, namely, /-er/ and /-ing/. Each child
then received a score from 0 to 4 (the /-er/ and /-ing/
questions for each of two verbs) on each syntactic frame.
We conducted a repeated measures ANOVA using
the between-subjects measures of dialect, clinical status,
and age and the within-subject variables of syntactic frame (intransitive, transitive, dative, and complement). The results show a significant main effect of age,

F(5, 505) = 6.94, p < .001, partial h2 = .064, and clinical
status, F(1, 505) = 46.49, p < .001, partial h2 = .084, but
no effect of dialect, F(1, 505) = 0.004, p = .95, partial h2 =
.000. Syntactic frame has a significant effect, F(3, 505) =
59.1, p < .001, partial h2 = .107. Graphs of the means for
each age by syntactic frame are displayed in Figures 5
through 8.
Two pairs of syntactic frames are best compared
with one another: (a) intransitives with transitives (one
or two arguments, respectively) and (b) dative with complements (both have three arguments). Intransitive argument verbs are slightly harder than transitive syntactic
frame structures, F(1, 517) = 4.79, p < .03, partial h2 =
.009, and this was true of both groups and at all ages.
Overall, complement frames are significantly harder than
dative frames, F(1, 517) = 148.27, p < .001, partial h2 =
.223, and this difference was greater for children at older
ages, F(1, 517) = 3.78, p < .002, partial h2 = .035, and the
older children with language impairment, F(1, 517) = 2.93,
p < .02, partial h2 = .028. In other words, complement

language impairment.

Discussion
Previous studies have shown conflicting results on
the difficulty that children with LI have in fast mapping novel verbs. However, the studies have been small
in scale and have looked at a restricted range of rather
simple syntactic frames (e.g., Eyer et al., 2002). In this
study, there was a much larger sample of children, and
a broader range of verb frames were explored. Using a
broader range of more complex syntactic frames allowed

us to detect a problem in children with LI with using the
frames to learn novel verbs.
In addition, to our knowledge no previous study has
controlled for the difficulty children might have with the
same frames used in this study with real verbs. Real
verbs were included in the warm-up because we thought
that children diagnosed as having language impairment
may have difficulty answering the questions types (see
Table 1) with real verbs.1 We asked whether the children
with LI had a real problem in answering questions with
all their associated morphology rather than in fast mapping itself. By covarying out the differential difficulty a
child might have on the same questions with real verbs,
we could ask whether children with language disorders
might have unusual problems in mapping novel verb
meanings. The result was a clear one: Clinical status has
a sizable impact on the ability of a child to map novel
verbs across the four frames of transitive, intransitive,
dative, and complement structures. In this study, we
found a genuine problem with fast mapping in children
with LI that is not attributable to a problem of retention over time (Oetting, 1999).
In addition, we took the two easiest questions with
real verbs, those morphemes that targeted the subject of
the verb: /-er/ and /-ing/. These morphemes were in
common across the four argument structures of intransitive, transitive, dative, and complements, enabling the
analysis of which structures were most difficult. First,
we discuss the contrast between intransitives and transitives. It may seem surprising that intransitives were
more difficult than transitives, but in fact this result
1
It should be noted that for a child who does not know these real verbs
already, this is also a syntactic bootstrapping task, albeit one for which he or
she has probably heard the words before.

reflects the ambiguity of intransitives. Many transitive
verbs can also be used intransitively, for example, "John
is eating a sandwich" Y "John is eating," "Mary is cutting the wood" Y "Mary is cutting." This means that
hearing an intransitive verb does not rule out the choice
of an actor having a causal effect on something, and hence
the children could choose the transitive actor in the case
of "Who is mooping?" (the mooper), but only if they
ignored the named subject. The verb was, after all, introduced with a named subject: "The boy is mooping."
Apparently, the grammatical potential of the verb frame
sometimes ruled in an option that pure memory could
have excluded. This is compatible with and extends
Fisher's (1996) results, in which children did not know
which actor to choose in intransitive frames.
Second, we compared dative and complement frames,
both of which have three arguments; however, in the case
of complements the three arguments are spread across
two clauses. Complements were harder than datives, and
more so for children with language impairment, with
regard to being available as a clue to the nature of the
verb in fast mapping. In general, dative verbs were not
more difficult than transitives. This may reflect the choice
to which they were linked, namely, complement-taking
verbs. If a new study were to contrast datives against
transitives directly, the results could be different.
The verbs in complements are relatively abstract:
verbs of communication and mental state, less concretely identifiable, and more dependent on frames for
their identification. Two of the questions taxed the children's ability to integrate a novel verb into a complex
sentence structure, for example, "What did the woman
gan the waiter to send?" However, even the questions
with /-er/ and /-ing/ reveal the younger children's difficulty in using the complex frame to identify the subject of the novel verbs clearly, and the children with
language impairment had particular difficulty.
We asked whether the task of fast mapping that
Johnson (2001) used could fulfill its promise as a measure of how well equipped a child is to learn a new word
(or words) from context. Such a measure requires three
things:

traditional acquired-vocabulary test. We argue that the
information from the two types of tests is complementary and that giving both types can help to determine
the causes of a low vocabulary, namely: different amounts
of experience, different opportunities to learn words,
different types of exposure to different parts of the lexicon, word learning difficulties rooted in a language
delay or disorder, or syntactic problems interfering with
bootstrapping.
The fast mapping index provides a measure of how
well equipped a child is to learn new words from context.
The question is whether the child's language (i.e., morphology, syntax, and existing words) is sufficient to make
a good guess at a new verb's meaning. Much of what the
child will be required to do in school is to learn new words
this way, and the test indirectly assesses whether the
basis for that inference has been laid. Of course, different
verb frames constitute only part of the information provided in context from which to glean information about a
verb's meaning, and there remains much more to be investigated. To construct such a test meant going beyond
the very simple mappings of nouns and verbs that are
supported by the earliest grammars, but in doing so a
bridge has been built to work on how older children arrive at meanings from text (Miller & Fellbaum, 1991;
Sternberg & Powell, 1983).
