Abstract
English monolinguals (Experiment 1) and first language (L1)-dominant, Spanish-English
and Chinese-English bilinguals (Experiment 2), who differed in L1 orthographic depth
(shallow: Spanish; deep: Chinese) and second language (L2-English) proficiency, decided
whether visually presented letter strings were English words, while behavioral and EEG
measures were recorded. The spelling-sound regularity and consistency of stimuli were
covaried such that words had either regular/consistent (e.g., GATE) or irregular/inconsistent mappings (e.g., PINT). Irregular/inconsistent words elicited more positive P200 and
less negative N400 amplitudes than regular/consistent words in monolinguals, yet only a
P200 response in bilinguals. English proficiency modulated L2 reading strategies, such that
bilinguals employed distinct reading unit sizes in the L2 than the L1 when L2 proficiency
was low, but transferred L1 reading units to the L2 when L2 proficiency was high. ERP
results suggest that high L2 proficiency may be a prerequisite to the cross-linguistic transfer
of reading strategies.

Mapping orthography to phonology, a process that becomes highly automatic with
experience, is at the core of skilled reading. In English, the ease of mapping spelling
to sound may be characterized in terms of regularity (Coltheart et al., 2001), which
measures whether the mappings violate grapheme-phoneme correspondence (GPC)
rules (Bolger et al., 2008), and consistency (Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989), which
measures whether the spellings map to multiple sounds. Irregularity and inconsistency of spelling-sound mappings have been associated with higher demands on
cognitive resources in word naming (e.g., Baron & Strawson, 1976; Coltheart &
Rastle, 1994; Lacruz & Folk, 2004) and lexical decision tasks (e.g., Lacruz & Folk,
2004). The cost of processing irregularity (Coltheart & Rastle, 1994) and inconsistency (Jared, 2002) has been linked to competing activations of correct and incorrect
pronunciations that take time to resolve, resulting in slower and less accurate

naming and recognition of words with irregular and/or inconsistent mappings
(Coltheart & Leahy, 1992; Glushko, 1979). Various computational models have
accounted for these effects (Coltheart et al., 1993; Plaut et al., 1996; Seidenberg &
McClelland, 1989). Effects of regularity have been accounted for by the dual
route cascaded model (DRC, Coltheart et al., 1993), which assumes that the phonological representations of printed words may be retrieved through a lexicalsemantic pathway, but can also be assembled based on GPC rules applied to the
orthographic input. The model predicts that the regularity effect occurs due to
competition between the output of the lexical-semantic and assembly routes.
Effect of consistency has been predicted by the DRC model to occur as a consequence of competition within the lexical route. Connectionist models of reading
(Plaut et al., 1996; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989) also account for consistency
effects, assuming that phonological representations of different spelling patterns
are learned through repeated exposure to a large corpus of words and are computed through a single procedure. When regularity and consistency are studied
in isolation, robust effects of consistency are observed, while effects of regularity
yield conflicting results (Andrews, 1982; Cortese & Simpson, 2000; Jared, 2002;
Kay & Bishop, 1987). Since irregular words are often inconsistent, results may be
confounded (Glushko, 1979). Critically, the magnitude of regularity and consistency effects decreases with experience, previously operationalized as chronological age (Waters et al., 1984; Weekes et al., 2006) and phonemic decoding skills
(Botezatu et al., in press), as readers become more reliant on lexical/semantic
processing.
For non-native English speakers, the process of computing phonology from text
is further complicated by proficiency in a native language (L1) with a fully overlapping (Jared & Kroll, 2001; Schwartz et al., 2007) or partially overlapping orthography (Marian & Kaushanskaya, 2004), as bilinguals must resolve competition from
both within- and cross-language pronunciation enemies (for a review of lexical
access in bilinguals, see Kroll et al., 2022). Jared and Kroll (2001) were among
the first to demonstrate that bilinguals experience competition from spelling-tosound correspondences in the nontarget language. Their study showed that naming
a block of filler words in the nontarget language increased competition from enemy
pronunciations when naming a subsequent block of L1 or second language (L2)
words. Van Leerdam et al. (2009) provided additional evidence that bilinguals experience interference from both within- and cross-language enemy neighbors when
reading L2 words. The authors found that Dutch-English bilinguals activated the
incorrect phonological representation of printed L2-English words when primed
by auditory rimes that either derived from English (within-language) enemy neighbors, or had Dutch (cross-language) enemy neighbors and were pronounced using
Dutch phonology. Furthermore, Botezatu et al. (submitted) also found a positive
correlation between regularity-consistency effects in English word naming and
objective measures of Spanish proficiency in English-dominant heritage speakers
of Spanish.
Differences in the arbitrariness of print-to-sound mappings between bilinguals'
two languages (i.e., orthographic depth; Seymour et al., 2003) further complicate the
computation of phonology from orthography in the L2, as readers have already
developed an optimal reading unit (i.e., phoneme, syllable, rime, whole word), or

"grain size" (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005; Ziegler et al., 2001) in response to the transparency of print-to-sound mappings in their L1 (Katz & Frost, 1992; Martensen
et al., 2000), which may not be the optimal reading unit for their L2. In transparent
alphabetic orthographies such as Spanish, where a letter (or letter combination) is
consistently mapped to one sound, readers favor small grain sizes, efficiently relying
on letter-by-letter or syllable-by-syllable decoding strategies (Ziegler & Goswami,
2005; Ziegler et al., 2001). In opaque or deep alphabetic orthographies such as
English, where the same letter (or combination of letters) can map to multiple
sounds (e.g., the "ERE" rime in THERE [.r], HERE [hr], WERE [wr]), readers
may rely to a greater extent on large grain sizes (Frost, Katz & Bentin, 1987) at rime
or whole word levels (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005; Ziegler et al., 2001). Chinese, which
uses a logographic writing system, is also described as having a deep orthography
(Lee et al., 2005) because no assembly is possible or necessary within individual
graphic units (i.e., characters or morphemes), which map onto whole syllables that
often constitute entire words (Liu et al., 1996; Perfetti & Liu, 2005; Perfetti et al.,
2007). Most modern Chinese characters are semantic-phonetic compounds (Shu
et al., 2003), which contain a semantic radical (encoding meaning) and a phonetic
radical (encoding pronunciation) that enable the lexical retrieval of phonology
much like in alphabetic orthographies (Perfetti & Tan, 1998; Zhang et al., 1999).
Nonetheless, evidence that Chinese speakers may also access sublexical phonology
(Lee et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2003) comes from studies reporting effects of regularity
(i.e., operationalized as the match between the pronunciation of a Chinese character
and its phonetic radical, regardless of tonal differences; see Hue, 1992) and consistency (i.e., operationalized as the relative number of friend and enemy pronunciations within an orthographic neighborhood of Chinese characters that share the
same phonetic radical; see Lee et al., 2010) in Chinese character naming.
Bilinguals have been reported to transfer word reading skills from the L1 both
within (Mumtaz & Humphreys, 2001) and across writing systems (Wang et al.,
2005). Available evidence suggests that bilinguals who transfer reading strategies
from logographic orthographies prefer using a large grain size in English, rather
than relying on English GPC rules to activate phonology (Tan et al., 2003). In contrast, bilinguals who transfer word reading skills from shallow orthographies show
heavier reliance on small rather than large grain sizes in English (Mumtaz &
Humphreys, 2001) - a strategy that comes at the cost of resolving competition from
L1 spelling-sound mappings (Schwartz et al., 2007), which often differ from L2
mappings (predominantly an issue for vowels, see Treiman et al., 1995).
Furthermore, the grain size accommodation hypothesis (Lallier & Carreiras,
2018) proposes that bilingual readers of two orthographies with distinct depths
may not simply transfer the grain size preferences cross-linguistically, but rather
may develop a hybrid grain size between those employed by monolingual speakers
of each language. The use of a hybrid grain size would predict not only an overreliance on sublexical strategies in reading a deep L2 orthography for bilingual readers
of a shallow L1 orthography but also the use of larger grains in a shallower L2
orthography by readers of a deep L1 orthography. Available evidence suggests that
the preferred reading strategy in the L2 may also depend on L2 proficiency. Botezatu
et al. (in press) found a larger cost in naming irregular/inconsistent than regular/
consistent English words in Spanish-English bilinguals with lower L2-English

proficiency, suggesting that as L2 proficiency increases, bilinguals adapt their reading strategy to better fit the L2. The idea that bilinguals' reading strategies may shift
with dominance is supported by Meschyan and Hernandez (2006), who reported
that Spanish-English bilinguals dominant in L2-English adopted a visually driven
(lexical) reading strategy in English.

The current study
The current study exploits differences in orthographic depth between bilinguals' two
languages for the purpose of determining whether bilinguals transfer reading strategies from the dominant L1 to the weaker L2 in the process of mapping print to
sound in L2-English. To capture the computation of phonology from orthography,
a process that is highly automatic in adult skilled readers, I employed Event-Related
Potentials (ERPs) to index processing dynamics in real time. Although past work
evaluating language transfer effects in reading has relied primarily on behavioral
methods (for a review, see Durgunoglu & Hancin, 1992), ERPs may be sensitive
to implicit L2 processing that is masked in behavioral performance (McLaughlin
et al., 2004; Tokowicz & MacWhinney, 2005). Thus, ERPs may reveal effects of reading unit transfer that are not evident in behavioral measures. Studies with monolinguals have reported effects of spelling-sound regularity/consistency as a two-stage
process that indexes phonological competition at sublexical (P200) and lexical
(N400) levels. The P200 is sensitive to the degree of mismatch between the orthographic and phonological features of words (Kramer & Donchin, 1987). Larger
P200s have been reported to irregular English words (Martin et al., 2006; Sereno
et al., 1998) and to irregular (Yum et al., 2014) and low consistency Chinese characters
(Hsu et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007), reflecting competition among phonological forms.
An index of lexical access (see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011, for a review), the N400, is
modulated by lexical properties such as orthographic neighborhood size (Holcomb
et al., 2002). Larger N400s have been reported to be regular (Yum et al., 2014) and
high-consistency Chinese characters (Hsu et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007), reflecting competition among phonological neighbors. To date, no studies have reported modulations of the N400 to regularity or consistency manipulations in English.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 evaluated the time course of processing spelling-sound regularity and
consistency in English monolinguals. Although effects of regularity and consistency
have been traditionally evaluated in tasks that require explicit access to phonology,
such as naming (Baron & Strawson, 1976; Coltheart & Rastle, 1994; Lacruz & Folk,
2004) and rhyme judgment (Bolger et al., 2008; Botezatu, in press), slower response
latencies (Stanovich & Bauer, 1978) and lower accuracy rates (Schmalz et al., 2013)
to irregular words and inconsistent words (Lacruz & Folk, 2004; Stone et al., 1997;
Ziegler et al., 2001) have also been reported in lexical decision tasks, suggesting that
phonological information may be available automatically in lexicality judgments.
Lexical decision tasks have an advantage over naming tasks in ERP studies, as they
eliminate undesirable movement artifacts.

As in prior studies (Andrews, 1982; Glushko, 1979; Jared, 2002; Kay & Bishop,
1987), the current work confounded regularity and consistency to generate a robust
effect. It was hypothesized that if English monolinguals use a small reading unit,
they would produce longer latencies and lower accuracy rates, as well as larger
P200 and smaller N400 mean amplitudes to irregular/inconsistent than regular/consistent words. Alternatively, if monolinguals use a large grain size, effects of regularity/consistency may be observed in electrophysiological measures of lexical
(N400) processing, but should be short-lived and therefore absent from the behavioral data.

Method
Participants

Results are presented for 21 native speakers of English (8 male; mean age = 20.9;
range = 18-27 years) recruited from Pennsylvania State University, who varied in
English proficiency (see Table 1) and had limited knowledge of an L2 (no exposure
to an L2 prior to the age of 6, less than 4 years of formal study of an L2 at the high
school or college level, and no study abroad experience). A total of 29 English monolinguals completed the study for payment, but data from 8 participants were
excluded from the analysis either because they had fewer than 70% artifact-free
correct response trials per condition or because they failed to maintain at least
70% accuracy for overall "yes" and "no" responses. Participants were right-handed,
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of neurological, language,
or reading disorders, according to self-report.

Materials and procedure
Participants completed two testing sessions. During the initial testing session, participants provided self-ratings of language exposure and use and performed a lexical
decision task while behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) measures were
recorded. Behavioral measures of picture naming, as well as timed and untimed
measures of sight word reading and phonemic decoding, were collected during a

242

second testing session scheduled one week later. The lexical decision and picture
naming tasks were presented electronically using in-house and E-Prime 2.0 software
(Psychology Software Tools Incorporated, 2012), respectively, which recorded triallevel response latencies and accuracy. Each task is described below.
Lexical decision

Effects of spelling-sound regularity/consistency were measured in a visual lexical
decision task. Participants were presented with 150 words and 150 pseudowords
in semi-randomized order. All items had consonant onsets and were matched on
length and number of syllables (equal numbers of monosyllabic and bisyllabic trials
per condition) and controlled for syllable stress. Words were matched on lexical
frequency using the American National Corpus (Ide & Suderman, 2004) norms.
Experimental trials were 100 English words that covaried systematically in the regularity and consistency of their spelling-sound mappings: 50 regular/consistent
words (e.g., GATE) and 50 irregular/inconsistent words (e.g., PINT). Regularity
was judged based on the degree to which words could be pronounced correctly following English GPC rules; consistency was judged based on rime neighborhoods of
similar and contrasting pronunciations (Jared, 1997, 2002), following the Ziegler
et al. (1997) norms. A word was considered to be consistent if its rime (e.g.,
-ATE) mapped to a single phonological representation (e.g., /_et/, having rhyming
neighbors, known as friends: DATE, FATE, RATE), but inconsistent if its rime (e.g.,
-INT) mapped to distinct, enemy, pronunciations (e.g., /_nt/ as in HINT and LINT,
but /_ant/ as in PINT). Irregular/inconsistent words chosen for this study had the
less frequent rime pronunciation. Table 2 summarizes the lexical properties of the
experimental conditions.
Filler trials were 50 language ambiguous words (Spanish-English cognates with
complete orthographic overlap across the two translations) and 150 pseudowords
created from a set of base words with regular-consistent and irregular-inconsistent
mappings by changing the onset consonant. Filler items were not considered in the
current analysis.
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair in a dimly lit, sound-attenuated,
and electrically shielded booth, fitted with an elastic electrode cap, and asked to perform a visual lexical decision task, which consisted of a continuous stream of 300
stimuli, with brief breaks every 100 trials. Stimuli were presented in Arial font white
capital letters in the center of a black screen at a viewing distance of approximately
48 inches. The sequence of events for each trial was as follows: participants viewed a
1200 millisecond (ms) central fixation cross (), followed by a 300 ms blank screen,
a stimulus presented for 350 ms, and finally a 850 ms blank screen before the presentation of the next fixation cross. Participants were instructed not to blink or
move unless the fixation cross was on the screen and to respond quickly and accurately to each stimulus by pressing one button of the response device if the stimulus
was a word in English and another button if the stimulus was not a word in English.
The button pressed for "yes" versus "no" responses was counterbalanced across participants. A set of 18 practice trials preceded the experimental set. Participants were
given feedback about their blink performance, but not their response accuracy, after
the practice trials and during breaks, if needed.

EEG recordings

The EEG was recorded continuously with 29 tin electrodes mounted on an elastic
electrode cap (Electro-Cap International, Eaton, OH). The electrode positions
included 11 electrodes placed at standard International 10-20 system locations
at left (indicated by odd numbers) and right (indicated by even numbers) hemisphere frontal (F3/F4), central (C3/C4), temporal (T3/T4), parietal (P3/P4) sites,
as well as frontal (Fz), central (Cz) and parietal (Pz) midline sites. Ten additional
electrodes were placed at the frontal (FPz) and occipital (Oz) poles, the left and right

244

hemisphere fronto-central sites (FC1/FC2, FC5/FC6), and centro-parietal sites
(CP1/CP2, CP5/CP6). Another eight electrodes were placed at 33% of the distance
from FPz to T3/T4 (FP1'/FP2'), 67% of the distance from FPz to T3/T4 (F7'/ F8'),
33% of the distance from Oz to T3/T4 (O1'/O2'), and 67% of the distance from Oz
to T3/T4 (T5'/T6').
Electrodes were also placed over the left (A1) and right (A2) mastoids, with the
left mastoid serving as the reference. The right mastoid was recorded to determine
if there was any differential mastoid activity. Horizontal eye movements were measured with an electrode lateral to the right eye (HE), and vertical eye movements/
blinks were monitored with an electrode below the left eye (LE). Impedances were
reduced to less than 5 kilo-ohms (k) for the scalp and mastoid electrodes and less
than 10 k for the eye electrodes. The EEG was amplified by a SA Bioamplifier
system with a bandpass of 0.1 to 40 hertz (Hz) and sampled continuously at a rate
of 200 Hz. A 15-Hz low pass filter was applied to each individual participant's data
prior to grand-averaging the data for presentation. This filtering step was not
applied to the data used for the statistical analyses.

Picture naming

Expressive vocabulary was assessed using a published picture naming task
(Hoshino & Kroll, 2008). Participants named 36 black-and-white line drawings
in English. Each trial began with a fixation sign, which was replaced with a 500
ms blank screen at the press of a button, followed by a randomly selected line drawing presented until response onset and ended with a 200 ms blank screen. A set of 20
practice trials preceded the experimental set. Picture naming performance was
scored in terms of number and average latency of correct response trials.

Sight word reading

The efficiency of sight word reading was assessed in English using both timed (i.e.,
speeded) and untimed measures. Speeded sight word reading was assessed in
English using the Sight Word Efficiency subtest of the Test of Word Reading
Efficiency (TOWRE; Torgesen et al., 1999), which measured the number of words
of increasing difficulty (out of 104) read aloud correctly within 45 seconds. Untimed
sight word reading was assessed in English using the Word Identification subtest of
the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests - Revised (WRMT-R; Woodcock, 1987),
which measured the number of words of increasing difficulty (out of 105) read aloud
correctly.

Phonemic decoding

Phonemic decoding was assessed in English using both timed (i.e., speeded) and
untimed measures. Speeded phonemic decoding was assessed in English using the
Phonemic Decoding Efficiency subtest of the TOWRE (Torgesen et al., 1999), which
measured the number of nonwords of increasing difficulty (out of 63) read correctly
within 45 seconds. Untimed phonemic decoding was assessed in English using the

Applied Psycholinguistics

245

Word Attack subtests of the WRMT-R (Woodcock, 1987), which measured the number of nonwords of increasing difficulty (out of 45) read correctly.

Language exposure and use

Participants completed a paper-and-pencil language history questionnaire (Li et al.,
2020), providing demographic and language experience information, as well as selfratings of L1 and L2 proficiency. A proficiency self-rating score was computed for
each language by averaging self-ratings of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.
Data analysis

Study materials, data, and analysis code are available at https://osf.io/rk3xv/. The
study design and analyses were not pre-registered. The analyses were implemented
in R version 3.6.0 (R Development Core Team, 2016; http://cran.us.r-project.org/) using
the ez package version 4.4-0 (Lawrence, 2016). Behavioral and EEG measures were
used to evaluate performance on the lexical decision task. Correct response latencies
recorded within the 200-2000 ms time window post-stimulus onset, accuracy rates,
and mean amplitudes elicited by the regular/consistent and irregular/inconsistent
conditions were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance
(ANOVA). Trials on which the response was more than 3 standard deviations above
participant or item means were removed from the response latency and accuracy
analyses, as these very slow responses likely reflected a distinct response strategy
and would be confounded by decay of the stimulus from working memory.
The raw EEG signal was time-locked to stimulus onset. Recordings were examined for muscle artifact and eye movements/blinks. Contaminated trials were
removed from the analyses, along with incorrect response trials. Artifact rejection
involved a two-stage process. The computer initially applied a standard algorithm to
reject artifact-filled trials (i.e., trials containing vertical or horizontal eye movements
exceeding 1500 A/D units from 100 ms before to 900 ms after word onset), and then,
the resulting output was manually checked and validated. To ensure that averages
were based on artifact-free data, parameters of the standard algorithm were adjusted
when needed. After excluding trials with errors and artifacts, 12.2% of trials from
the regular/consistent condition and 14.6% of trials from the irregular/inconsistent
condition were rejected. The percentage of rejected trials did not differ significantly
between experimental conditions, t(20) = -1.52, p = .144. Separate ERPs to items
in the critical conditions were averaged offline for each participant at each electrode
site, aligned to a 100 ms pre-stimulus baseline (i.e., -100 ms to 0 ms pre-stimulus
onset) and ending 900 ms post-stimulus onset. Based on visual inspection of the
waveforms and prior reports, the following time windows were selected to evaluate
the mean amplitude elicited by regular/consistent relative to irregular/inconsistent
words in native English speakers: 150-250 ms (P200) and 250-450 ms (N400).
Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed separately for the midline electrode
sites (FPz, Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz) and for each of three concentric rings of lateral electrode
sites (inner circle: FC1/FC2, C3/C4, CP1/CP2; middle circle: F3/F4, FC5/FC6, CP5/
CP6, P3/P4; outer circle: FP1/FP2, F7/F8, T3/T4, T5/T6, O1/O2). Lateral electrode

sites also included a factor of hemisphere (left versus right). Analyses were divided
into these regions to allow for description of the topographic distribution of the
effects, considering the relative positions of the electrodes. Each set of sites allows
for comparison of effects from anterior to posterior, and across the sets, effects can
be described along the dimension of medial (midline) to lateral (outer circle) (see
Guo et al., 2012; Holcomb et al., 2005; West & Holcomb, 2000 for other studies of
language processing using this analysis method). For each set of analyses, factors of
interest were regularity/consistency, electrode site, and hemisphere (if appropriate).
Only regularity/consistency main effects and interactions of regularity/consistency with the other variables (electrode, hemisphere) were reported, since main
effects of electrode site or hemisphere, or interactions of only those terms reflect
topographic differences in ERP patterns separate from the conditions that were
manipulated in the current experiment. All results are reported as significant at
the .05 level, unless otherwise noted. For comparisons with more than two levels,
the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for nonsphericity was applied; uncorrected
degrees of freedom and corrected F- and p-values were reported. Significant interactions were followed up with simple-effects analysis, and/or post hoc Bonferronicorrected t tests were appropriate to better characterize the effects. Corrected
p-values are also reported for the Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t tests.

Results
Behavioral results

Incorrect response trials (representing 5.8% of the data) were first excluded from the
response latency data. Then, absolute outliers (trials with responses below 200 ms
and above 2000 ms, representing 0.4% of the data) and relative outliers (trials with
responses 3 standard deviations slower than each participant or item mean response
latency, representing 2.5% of the data) were excluded from the behavioral data.
Response latencies and accuracy rates to words with regular/consistent and irregular/inconsistent mappings are shown in Table 3. English monolinguals were equally
fast, F(1, 20) = 0.939, p = .344, and accurate, F(1, 20) = 1.593, p = .221, in
responding to regular/consistent and irregular/inconsistent English words.
Electrophysiological results

Figure 1 shows the ERP waveforms elicited by regular/consistent versus irregular/
inconsistent words at all 29 scalp electrode sites. The waveforms elicited during the
task showed a series of peaks consistent with previous visual word recognition studies. Specifically, there was a clear negative peak around 100 ms (N100), followed by a

positive peak around 200 ms (P200), a negative peak around 400 ms (N400), and a
positive peak around 600 ms (LPC). The regularity/consistency effect was notable as a
subtle mean amplitude difference between conditions, such that irregular/inconsistent
words showed a trend toward a more positive waveform relative to regular/consistent
words at some sites in each analysis window. However, the sites that showed the
effects varied across components (P200, N400), and the differences between the conditions were small, as supported by the statistical results reported below.
In the 150-250 ms (P200) window, there was a significant interaction between regularity/consistency and hemisphere only over the inner circle: F(1, 20) = 5.057,
p = .036. Although post hoc tests failed to reach significance, the pattern of results
shows a left hemisphere distribution of the effect over the inner circle, with more positive P200 amplitudes elicited by irregular/inconsistent than regular/consistent words.
In the 250-450 ms (N400) window, there was a trend toward a significant interaction between regularity/consistency and electrode over the middle: F(3, 60) = 3.292,
p = .066 and outer circles: F(4, 80) = 2.478, p = .098. Although these interactions
failed to reach significance, the pattern of results shows a more negative N400 amplitude elicited by regular/consistent relative to irregular/inconsistent words over frontal
(F3/F4, F7/F8) and fronto-central (FC5/FC6) electrode sites.

Discussion
Experiment 1 examined effects of regularity/consistency in English word recognition in monolinguals. Behavioral measures revealed no differences between regular/

248

consistent and irregular/inconsistent English words. Electrophysiological measures
revealed subtle amplitude differences over the P200 and N400 components, with
trends suggesting more positive waveforms to irregular/inconsistent words over
the P200 and more negative waveforms to regular/consistent words over the N400.
The pattern of behavioral results observed in monolinguals is consistent with
previous behavioral studies that found no effects of spelling-sound regularity and
consistency in native English speakers in lexical decision (Coltheart et al., 1979;
Seidenberg et al., 1984). The lack of spelling-sound regularity effects in lexical decision has been linked to faster access of the orthographic lexicon relative to the
assembly route in proficient readers, such as college-aged students (Besner,
1990). When regularity effects are detected in lexical decision, they have been associated with the presence of low-frequency words with low bigram frequencies in the
stimulus list (Seidenberg et al., 1984). The results of the current study are not surprising, considering that participants were college-aged English monolinguals with
good reading skills and that the lexical decision task did not contain a manipulation
of lexical frequency.
The pattern of results observed in the ERP data (i.e., more positive P200 and less
negative N400 amplitudes to irregular/inconsistent relative to regular/consistent
words), although not largely significant, replicates the ERP signature previously
reported in response to spelling-sound regularity (Yum et al., 2014) and consistency
(Hsu et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007) in Chinese monolinguals. Together with the
behavioral results, the ERP measures bring additional support to the argument that
college-aged English monolinguals are not reliant on the regularity and consistency
of English words in lexical decision. Regularity and consistency effects are also
found to be absent in lexical decision in Chinese monolinguals (Yum et al.,
2014), suggesting that skilled readers may bypass phonology in lexical decision.

Summary of results
Experiment 1 revealed that English words with irregular/inconsistent mappings elicited an ERP signature of more positive P200 and less negative N400 amplitudes
than words with regular/consistent mappings in English monolinguals performing
a lexical decision task. Critically, the effects were short-lived, disappearing before a
behavioral response was made.

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 investigated the time course of processing spelling-sound regularity/
consistency in English (a deep orthography) in non-native speakers with distinct L1
orthographic depths (i.e., shallow: Spanish; deep: Chinese). It was predicted that
bilinguals transfer distinct grain sizes from the L1 to the L2 depending on L1 orthographic depth. Since Spanish-English bilinguals can successfully rely on small reading units in L1-Spanish, they were predicted to use a small reading unit when
reading L2-English words, evidenced by larger P200 and smaller N400 amplitudes
for words with irregular/inconsistent mappings. In contrast, since Chinese-English
bilinguals can successfully rely on large reading units in L1-Chinese, they were

Applied Psycholinguistics

249

predicted to transfer the preference for a large reading unit when reading L2-English
words, evidenced by a difference between regular/consistent and irregular/consistent conditions at the lexical level (N400), but not at the sublexical level (P200).
In other words, if bilinguals' transfer word reading strategies from the L1 to the
L2 as a function of L1 orthographic depth, or adopt a hybrid grain size as proposed
by the grain size accommodation hypothesis (Lallier & Carreiras, 2018), then
Chinese-English bilinguals should experience reduced sensitivity to regularity/consistency in L2-English relative to Spanish-English bilinguals. It is also possible that
L2 proficiency may drive the observed effects. If L1-L2 transfer occurs at lower levels of L2 proficiency, when bilinguals are not yet attuned to the degree of consistency
in the L2 print-to-sound mappings and experience most interference from the L1,
then bilinguals with lower English proficiency should transfer L1 reading units to
the L2, whereas bilinguals with higher English proficiency should adapt a large grain
size to better fit the L2-English, approaching native-like performance. If transfer
occurs at higher levels of L2 proficiency, then bilinguals should adopt a distinct
reading unit in the L2 at lower levels of L2 proficiency and should transfer their
L1 reading unit preference once they have achieved higher levels of L2 proficiency.
Alternatively, if bilinguals are observed to differ from the monolingual group in similar ways, regardless of proficiency level, then results may simply reflect general
strategy differences in L2 readers.

Method
Participants

Results are presented for two groups of non-native English speakers recruited from
Pennsylvania State University: (1) 22 Spanish-English bilinguals (9 male; mean
age = 24.1; range = 18-32 years) and (2) 18 Chinese-English bilinguals (3 male;
mean age = 21.6; range = 18-26 years) with no consistent exposure to English before
age of 6 and whose L1 was the primary language of instruction in school through the
eighth grade and was still their dominant language based on self-ratings and picture
naming accuracy measures. However, performance on word reading and phonemic
decoding measures revealed that participants were stronger in L2-English as a consequence of living and studying at the university level in an L2-English environment (see
Table 4). The two groups differed on L2-English proficiency, with Chinese-English
bilinguals performing more poorly than the Spanish-English bilinguals on L2English measures of word reading, picture naming accuracy, and self-ratings.
A total of 50 bilinguals completed the study, but data from 7 Spanish-English to 3
Chinese-English bilinguals were excluded because they either failed to produce at
least 40% correct, artifact-free responses per condition or to maintain at least
60% accuracy for overall "yes" and "no" responses. All of the other participant qualification criteria were identical to those used in Experiment 1.

was identical to Experiment 1. The only difference was that during the second
testing session, behavioral measures of picture naming, sight word reading, and
phonemic decoding were not only administered in English (L2), but also in
the L1 (Spanish or Chinese). Participants were tested in L1 first and L2 last
to avoid dominant language inhibition following weaker-language use (Misra
et al., 2012).

Picture naming

Expressive vocabulary in L1 and L2-English was assessed using the same picture
naming task described in Experiment 1. Participants were randomly assigned
one of two equivalent sets of 36 black-and-white line drawings to name in L1 or
L2, respectively. In each language, picture naming performance was scored in terms
of number and average latency of correct response trials.

Sight word reading

The efficiency of sight word reading was assessed in L2-English using both timed
(i.e., Sight Word Efficiency) and untimed (i.e., Word Identification) measures, as
described in Experiment 1. Speeded sight word reading was tested in L1-Spanish
using an equivalent measure of the TOWRE (i.e., a list of 104 Spanish words of
increasing length) developed by Miller et al. (2006) and in Mandarin Chinese using
a list of 92 Chinese nouns increasing in difficulty (T. Guo, personal communication,
May 18, 2010). Each version of the task measured the number of words of increasing
difficulty read aloud correctly within 45 seconds. Untimed sight word reading was
measured in Spanish using the Word Identification subtest of the Pruebas de
Aprovechamiento-Revisada (Woodcock et al., 2004), composed of 76 Spanish
words of increasing length, and in Mandarin Chinese using a second in-house test
developed for the current study, composed of 92 Chinese nouns increasing in difficulty. Each version of the task measured the number of words of increasing difficulty read aloud correctly.

Phonemic decoding

Phonemic decoding was tested in English only using the Phonemic Decoding subtest of the TOWRE (Torgesen et al., 1999) and the Word Attack subtest of the
WRMT-R (Woodcock, 1987) described in Experiment 1.
Language exposure and use

Participants completed a comprehensive paper-and-pencil language history questionnaire (Li et al., 2020), providing information about L2 learning experience
and use. A proficiency self-rating score was computed for each language by averaging self-ratings of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.
Data analysis

The same artifact-rejection procedure was used as in Experiment 1. After excluding
trials with errors and artifacts, 16.3% of trials from the regular/consistent condition
and 17.2% of trials from the irregular/inconsistent condition were rejected. The percentage of rejected trials did not differ significantly between experimental conditions,
t(39) = -0.74, p = .463. The following time windows were selected to evaluate the
electrophysiological signature of the regularity/consistency effect in bilinguals: 175-
300 ms (P200) and 300-450 ms (N400). These windows are slightly later than those
used in Experiment 1, but they fit the patterns observed in the bilingual data better, and
it is not surprising that non-native English speakers may require slightly longer processing times in the task (e.g., Ivanova & Costa, 2008; Sullivan et al., 2018). Experiment 2
used the same analyses as Experiment 1, except that L1 orthographic depth, operationalized categorically as group (Spanish-English versus Chinese-English bilinguals), and
English proficiency, operationalized continuously as Word Attack scores were entered
in the analyses as between-subject variables. Data were analyzed using the lme4 package
version 1.1-11 (Bates et al., 2016). Regularity/consistency, group, and English proficiency main effects and interactions of regularity/consistency with the other variables
(group, English proficiency, electrode, and hemisphere) are reported.

Results
Behavioral results

Incorrect response trials (representing 13.5% of the data) were first excluded from
the response latency data. Then, absolute outliers (trials with responses below
200 ms and above 2000 ms, representing 0% of the data) and relative outliers (trials
with responses 3 standard deviations slower than each participant or item mean
response latency, representing 2.9% of the data) were excluded from the behavioral
data. Response latencies and accuracy rates to words with regular/consistent and
irregular/inconsistent spelling-sound mappings are shown in Table 5. Bilinguals
were equally fast, F(1, 39) = 1.21, p = .273, and accurate, F(1, 38) = 2.68,
p = .102, in responding to regular/consistent and irregular/inconsistent English
words. There was a significant main effect of group on response latencies:
F(1, 39) = 6.27, p = .016 and accuracy: F(1, 39) = 8.08, p = .009. The results
indicate that Chinese-English bilinguals were overall slower and less accurate in recognizing English words relative to Spanish-English bilinguals.

100 ms (N100), followed by a positive peak around 200 ms (P200), a negative peak
around 400 ms (N400), and a positive peak around 600 ms (LPC). The regularity/consistency effect was characterized by a larger P200 mean amplitude to
irregular/inconsistent words and a pattern of smaller N400 mean amplitudes
to irregular/inconsistent words that failed to reach significance. The P200

In the 175-300 ms (P200) time window, there was a significant main effect of
regularity/consistency over each set of electrode sites: midline: F(1, 40) = 8.16,
p = .027; inner: F(1, 40) = 8.43, p = .024; middle: F(1, 40) = 9.68, p = .014
and outer circles: F(1, 40) = 8.74, p = .014. The result reveals that in both bilingual
groups, irregular/inconsistent words elicited more positive mean amplitudes relative to regular/consistent words over the P200. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction among regularity/consistency, group, and Word Attack
scores over the inner: F(1, 40) = 7.70, p = .033 and middle circles: F(1,
40) = 8.08, p = .028 and a trend toward significance over the midline: F(1,
40) = 6.37, p = .063 and outer circle: F(1, 40) = 6.01, p = .061. Post hoc tests
showed that the effect of regularity/consistency over the P200 was larger for
Spanish-English bilinguals with high English proficiency over the inner: F(1,
22) = 3.45, p = .077 and middle circles: F(1, 22) = 4.64, p = .043. In contrast,
the effect of regularity/consistency over the P200 was larger for Chinese-English bilinguals with lower English proficiency over the inner: F(1, 18) = 4.53, p = .047 and
middle circles: F(1, 18) = 3.80, p = .067.
In the 300-450 ms (N400) time window, the effect of consistency did not
reach significance. However, the pattern of results revealed a hint of a more
negative N400 amplitude to words with regular/consistent spelling-to-sound
mappings.

Discussion
Experiment 2 examined effects of regularity/consistency in L2-English word recognition in bilinguals who varied in L1 orthographic depth and L2 proficiency.
Regularity/consistency effects were not found on response latencies or accuracy
data. In the ERP record, irregular/inconsistent words elicited more positive P200
amplitudes than regular/consistent words in both bilingual groups, and these modulations were larger in Spanish-English bilinguals with high English proficiency and
in Chinese-English bilinguals with low English proficiency.
The absence of an effect of regularity/consistency on response latencies in bilinguals replicates Experiment 1 results and previous reports in the monolingual literature (Besner, 1990; Coltheart et al., 1979; Seidenberg et al., 1984), suggesting that
like monolinguals, bilinguals may be able to extract information about the lexicality
of a letter string directly from orthography. However, consistent with previous
reports (Sebastian-Galles et al., 2006), lexical decision in the L2 was overall slower
and less accurate for the less proficient group (i.e., Chinese-English bilinguals),
likely as a consequence of structural distance and lower exposure-based word frequency (for a review of "the weaker links hypothesis," see Gollan et al., 2008). The
null effect of regularity/consistency observed on response latencies may suggest that
behavioral measures are not sensitive enough to identify implicit processing of regularity/consistency in the weaker L2 (McLaughlin et al., 2004).
The more positive P200 amplitudes elicited by irregular/inconsistent relative to
regular/consistent words in both bilingual groups replicate the P200 response to regularity previously reported in monolingual speakers of English (Martin et al., 2006;
Sereno et al., 1998) and Chinese (Yum et al., 2014) and to consistency previously

Applied Psycholinguistics

reported in monolingual speakers of Chinese (Hsu et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007).
Results extend these findings to non-native speakers, replicating the signature of
more positive P200 amplitudes to irregular/inconsistent English words. In contrast
to previous reports (Hsu et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007; Yum et al., 2014), the manipulation of spelling-sound consistency and regularity did not modulate the N400
amplitude in bilinguals. This may suggest an overreliance on sublexical strategies
in bilinguals reading in the weaker L2 and possibly the absence of a fully developed
neighborhood of friend and enemy pronunciations in this language. Additionally,
contrary to the prediction, the ERP signature associated with the processing of
spelling-sound regularity/consistency did not fundamentally differ between bilingual groups, when the groups were compared as a whole. This result suggests that
regardless of L1 orthographic depth, non-native English speakers were sensitive to
regularity/consistency in a deep alphabetic L2 orthography and employed a sublexical strategy. However, when bilinguals in each group were divided based on English
proficiency (operationalized as Word Attack scores, a measure of phonemic decoding ability), a different pattern of results emerged. Specifically, Spanish-English
bilinguals with higher phonemic decoding skills in L2-English produced a larger
P200 response to irregular/inconsistent than regular/consistent words in L2English. In contrast, Chinese-English bilinguals with lower phonemic decoding
skills in L2-English produced a larger P200 response to irregular/inconsistent than
regular/consistent words in L2-English, suggesting more difficulty in resolving competition among phonological forms (Martin et al., 2006), while more proficient
Chinese-English bilinguals did not produce an electrophysiological response to regularity/consistency. This pattern of results may suggest that bilinguals with a shallow L1 orthography approach reading a deep L2 orthography with a larger grain at
lower levels of L1 proficiency, but employ a smaller reading unit as their L2 proficiency increases. In contrast, bilinguals with a deep L1 orthography may approach
reading a relatively more transparent L2 orthography with a small grain size, but
increase their reading unit as their L2 proficiency goes up.

Summary of results
Experiment 2 revealed that a more positive P200 amplitude was elicited by irregular/
inconsistent relative to regular/consistent L2-English words in bilinguals, regardless
of differences in L1 orthographic depth. The ERP response was larger in SpanishEnglish bilinguals with higher L2-English proficiency and in Chinese-English bilinguals with lower L2-English proficiency.

General discussion
The study investigated the computation of phonology from orthography in native
English speakers (Experiment 1) and two groups of non-native English speakers
with distinct L1 orthographic depths and L2 proficiency (Experiment 2) for the purpose of determining whether differences in L1 orthographic depth and L2 proficiency modulate bilinguals' transfer of word reading strategies from the
dominant L1 to the weaker L2. No differences were found in behavioral data.

However, the ERP record revealed that monolinguals produced more positive P200
and less negative N400 amplitudes in response to irregular/inconsistent relative to
regular/consistent L1-English words, whereas bilinguals produced a more positive
P200 amplitude in response to irregular/inconsistent relative to regular/consistent
L2-English words. The ERP response was more robust in bilinguals, but it did not
differ as a function of L1 orthographic depth. Critically, the magnitude of the P200
response was larger in Spanish-English bilinguals with higher L2-English proficiency and in Chinese-English bilinguals with lower L2-English proficiency.
The results of the current investigation support the claim that reading experience
and skill modulate sensitivity to spelling-sound regularity and consistency (Stuart &
Masterson, 1992; Waters et al., 1984) and extend it to account for differences in
English proficiency between native and non-native English speakers and between
groups of non-native English speakers who vary in L1 orthographic depth. The
study suggests that the ERP response to irregularity/inconsistency in spelling-sound
mappings occurs 25-50 ms later in non-native than native English speakers, but
may be more robust in non-native speakers than in monolinguals. This finding
is supported by studies reporting that the effect of consistency is more robust in
groups with lower reading skill (Waters et al., 1984; Weekes et al., 2006). The
P200 response has been previously shown to be larger in poorer decoders (Martin
et al., 2006), suggesting that the larger P200 response in non-native English speakers
may reflect poorer phonemic decoding skills relative to native English speakers (see
Tables 1 and 4 for differences in English phonemic decoding and other measures of
English proficiency between the monolingual and bilingual groups). Since bilinguals
are completing this task in the weaker L2, which is also a deep alphabetic orthography, it is not surprising that they would experience difficulty in selecting among
competing phonological forms.
Within the bilingual group as a whole, the ERP response to irregularity/inconsistency did not change as a function of differences in L1 orthographic depth.
However, when considering differences in L2-English proficiency at each level of
L1 orthographic depth, a different pattern of results emerged. In Chinese-English
bilinguals, the magnitude of the P200 response to irregularity/inconsistency was
large at low levels of L2-English proficiency, but were nearly absent at high levels
of L2-English proficiency. This suggests that Chinese-English bilinguals' approach
L2-English word reading with a small reading unit at low levels of L2-English proficiency, possibly as a consequence of structural or script differences between the
two languages, which may be linked to the overall lower L2-English proficiency
in Chinese-English bilinguals relative to Spanish-English bilinguals, but adopted
a larger reading unit at higher levels of proficiency, where their performance was
similar to that of English monolinguals. The similarity in performance between
Chinese-English bilinguals with higher English proficiency and English monolinguals may be explained by the fact that both groups have a deep L1 orthography.
This pattern is also consistent with studies showing evidence that bilinguals' reading
strategies shift to better fit the L2 as L2 proficiency increases (Botezatu et al., in
press; Meschyan & Hernandez, 2006). Botezatu et al. (in press) found that the
magnitude of regularity/consistency in L2-English word naming decreased at higher
levels of L2-English proficiency, suggesting that bilinguals who had achieved higher
L2 proficiency may have become more efficient in resolving competition from

Applied Psycholinguistics

257

within- and cross-language phonological neighbors (Jared & Kroll, 2001) or may
have become more reliant on lexical mediation in the L2 to reduce the effects of
cross-language competition (Nosarti et al., 2010). However, Spanish-English bilinguals showed the opposite pattern of performance, producing a P200 response to
irregularity/inconsistency at high levels of L2-English proficiency, but not at low
levels of L2-English proficiency. This result is inconsistent with the pattern observed
in English monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals in this study and elsewhere
(Botezatu et al., in press; Nosarti et al., 2010; Waters et al., 1984; Weekes et al., 2006)
and may suggest that Spanish-English bilinguals are reliant on lexical mediation in
the L2 at low levels of L2 proficiency, but employ a smaller reading unit at higher
levels of proficiency. It is possible that the presence of Spanish-English cognates in
the filler stimuli may have boosted competition from L1 spelling-sound mappings in
this group, causing them to rely on lexical mediation at low levels of English proficiency in order to reduce the interference effects from L1 competitors, which should
be largest at lower levels of L2 proficiency. However, this pattern of performance is
consistent with that reported by Botezatu et al. (submitted), who found that heritage
speakers of Spanish showed an increase in the magnitude of the regularity/consistency effect in English word naming as a function of higher Spanish proficiency and
related this pattern to bilinguals' frequent code-switching experience, which may be
associated with a cooperative (as opposed to competitive) use of the two languages
(Beatty-Martinez et al., 2020).
The distinct performance in the two bilingual groups as a function of L1 orthographic depth and L2 proficiency may suggest that bilinguals may use the transparency of their L1 orthography as a reference point for gauging the level of
transparency of their L2 orthography. When English proficiency was low, Spanish
speakers may have employed a large grain size in L2-English, perhaps expecting a
high degree of irregularity/inconsistency, whereas Chinese speakers employed a
small grain size in English, apparently expecting regularity/consistency. It should
be noted that both reading strategies could be (and were) used effectively. Thus,
when L2 proficiency was high, both groups of L1-dominant bilinguals appeared
more likely to transfer reading strategies from the L1 to the L2 as appropriate, suggesting that bilinguals gauge the level of transparency found in their L2 orthography
before transferring reading strategies from the L1 to the L2. This interpretation is
supported by the contrastive analysis hypothesis (Lado, 1957; Stockwell et al., 1965),
which postulates that cross-linguistic transfer between the L1 and L2 is modulated
by the differences and similarities between the two languages. Differences between
the two languages create interference effects leading to errors (i.e., negative transfer),
whereas similarities create facilitation (i.e., positive transfer). The results of the current study may suggest that contrastive reading strategies may be adopted in the L2
when proficiency is low to minimize the effects of interference from the stronger L1,
whereas positive transfer occurs when L2 proficiency is high. Consequently, differences between the L1 and L2 spelling-sound mapping systems may be more salient
for low-proficiency L2 speakers, whereas similarities between the two systems may
become more salient for higher-proficiency L2 speakers.
In conclusion, the present investigation provides evidence that L2 proficiency
modulates L1-to-L2 transfer of reading units in L1-dominant bilinguals. The finding
that bilinguals with high, but not low, L2 proficiency transfer reading strategies from

258

the L1 to the L2 is important because it suggests that cross-linguistic transfer may be
an indicator of high rather than low L2 proficiency. Furthermore, this finding suggests that bilinguals' adaptation of reading strategies to better fit to the L2 implies
an understanding of the similarities between the two orthographies and the recruitment of those reading units that are common across the two languages.
Additionally, it is important to note that this evidence was revealed by examining
the ERP record, while no differences were captured by behavioral measures. This
suggests that behavioral measures might not be sensitive enough to identify implicit
processing of regularity/consistency in the weaker L2.
Limitations and future directions

The current study has a number of limitations. A relatively small sample of participants was tested and some of the effects observed revealed statistical trends. Future
studies should attempt to replicate the current findings with larger participant samples. Additionally, effects of spelling-sound regularity/consistency were evaluated in
a lexical decision task, which does not require explicit access to phonology. Future
ERP studies should compare effects of regularity/consistency in lexical decision and
delayed naming tasks to determine whether effects are larger in tasks that require
explicit access to phonology, as reported in behavioral studies. Another limitation is
that the lexical decision task included some filler items that were language ambiguous, which may have overtly co-activated Spanish-English bilinguals' L1. Future
studies should investigate whether the effects are replicated when the task only
includes language-specific stimuli. In the current study, the two bilingual groups
differed in both L1 orthographic depth (i.e., shallow: Spanish; deep: Chinese)
and script (i.e., alphabetic: Spanish; logographic: Chinese). To determine whether
the interaction between bilingual group and proficiency was driven by differences
in orthographic depth, not script, future research should compare performance
between bilinguals whose L1 writing systems differ on orthographic depth, but
not script. Also, given that the current study evaluates performance in two bilingual
groups studying in an L2-speaking environment, the pattern of results reported fails
to capture changes associated with the initial contact with the L2. Future studies
should employ longitudinal designs to evaluate the association between withinsubject change in L2 proficiency and L2 word reading strategies adopted by bilingual readers of shallow L1 versus deep L1 orthographies. This would enable
researchers to follow changes in L2 word reading approaches from the initial contact
with the L2 until high levels of L2 proficiency have been reached, while also considering the effect of L2 immersion and L1 re-immersion experiences.
