Word processing development

A dual-stream dissociation for separate phonological and semantic processing has been implicated in adults'
language processing, but it is unclear how this dissociation emerges with development. By employing a graphtheory based brain network analysis, we compared functional interaction architecture during a rhyming and
meaning judgment task of children (aged 8-12) with adults (aged 19-26). We found adults had stronger func
tional connectivity strength than children between bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left inferior parietal lobule
in the rhyming task, between middle frontal gyrus and angular gyrus, and within occipital areas in the meaning
task. Meanwhile, adults but not children manifested between-task differences in these properties. In contrast,
children had stronger functional connectivity strength or nodal degree in Heschl's gyrus, superior temporal
gyrus, and subcortical areas. Our findings indicated spoken word processing development is characterized by
increased functional specialization, relying on the dorsal and ventral pathways for phonological and semantic
processing respectively.

1. Introduction
Understanding spoken language is a hallmark of child development.
Spoken language comprehension is a process of extracting meaningful
information from acoustic stimuli. It involves not only the perception
and recognition of acoustic cues, but also the mapping between recog
nized phonological and semantic concepts. Therefore, spoken language
processing integrates both bottom-up acoustic processing and top-down
processing based on knowledge.
Spoken language processing involves the interaction of a network of
brain regions (Hickok & Poeppel, 2004; Price, 2012), including inferior
frontal gyrus (Alho et al., 2016; Murakami et al., 2015), premotor cortex
(Osnes et al., 2012), superior temporal cortex (Murakami et al., 2015),
and inferior parietal cortex (Obleser & Kotz, 2010). These regions are
often conceptually divided into two general streams: dorsal and ventral.
According to the dual-stream model of the functional anatomy of lan
guage proposed by Hickok and Poeppel, the dorsal stream of involves
the opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior parts of insula,

and the inferior parietal region. This stream is responsible for auditor
y-motor integration, linking the acoustic cues of speech with the artic
ulation representations. As for the ventral stream, this mainly includes
the middle and inferior temporal cortex, and the triangular part of the
inferior frontal gyrus. This stream is responsible for the sound to
meaning integration, mapping sensory or phonological representations
onto lexical conceptual representations (Hickok & Poeppel, 2004; 2007;
Rauschecker, 2011). Currently, this framework has been supported by
both functional (Saur et al., 2008) and structural evidence from nontonal language studies (Brauer, Anwander, & Friederici, 2011; Brauer,
Anwander, Perani, & Friederici, 2013). Moreover, a recent study
comparing the neural network subserving spoken word processing in
Chinese (a tonal language) and English speakers, indicated that although
Chinese word comprehension was characterized by involvement of right
anterior temporal cortex, word processing across both languages was
largely carried out in the common left hemisphere network including
inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and anterior temporal
cortex (Ge et al., 2015). This suggests that Chinese spoken word

processing generally follows this dual-stream framework. However, it
should be noted that, this dual-stream framework is proposed based on
adult data, so we do not know whether spoken language processing in
children adheres to this dual-stream model.
As proposed by Interactive Specialization theory, the onset of a new
cognitive ability is due to changes in the interactive pattern between
multiple brain regions, and this interaction results in greater task
specialization with increased skill proficiency and development (John
son, 2011). In a recent work on reading development, Liu et al. (2018)
demonstrated that only adults showed between-task differences in interregional functional interaction patterns, whereas children failed to show
any task differences, suggesting adults' reading network is more
specialized (Liu et al., 2018). However, previous studies concerning the
development of spoken word processing examined only local activation
or seed region connectivity, the latter of which represents functional
connectivity between a pre-defined region and the rest of the brain.
Although activation analysis of particular local brain regions and func
tional connectivity of seed regions are informative, a whole-brain con
nectivity approach is needed to understand how the network for spoken
language processing changes with development. Graph theory-based
network analysis methods provide an informative way to study func
tional connectivity architecture from a large-scale perspective (Bullmore
& Sporns, 2009; 2012). However, the majority of graph theory-based
studies on functional brain development have examined taskindependent resting-state functional networks, which might have
missed the topological properties and connectivity profiles modulated
by task demands. Therefore, graph theoretical analysis under specific
tasks can provide a targeted method for investigating the architecture
supporting cognitive development.
Many of previous studies of spoken language processing develop
ment have used rhyming judgment to tap into auditory-motor integra
tion (Booth et al., 2001; 2004; Cao et al., 2011). In this task, participants
were instructed to determine whether the stimuli in a word pair rhymed
or not. These studies have demonstrated that the dorsal auditory-motor
processing pathway tends to increase in activation with age in phono
logical tasks. For example, Booth et al. (2001; 2004) adopted an audi
tory English rhyming judgment task, which required participants to
determine whether the final word rhymed with the first word (e.g., seat
rhymed with heat, wish did not rhyme with wall). They found that
adults had more activation in bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left
angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, opercular part of inferior frontal
gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, compared with children (Booth
et al., 2001; 2004). In another study with the auditory word rhyming
judgment task in Chinese, it was found that adults had significantly
higher activation in the opercular part of bilateral inferior frontal gyri
than children (Cao et al., 2011). In addition, studies by Everts (2001)
and Holland (2009) showed that the activation of the left inferior frontal
gyrus (pars opercularis) and middle frontal gyrus increased with age in a
vowel detection task (Everts et al., 2009; Holland et al., 2001), and that
activation in right frontal cortex decreased with age in a speech
perception task (Holland et al., 2001), suggesting a left lateralized
developmental trend in the dorsal pathway. Moreover, the functional
connectivity between dorsal regions (e.g. between left superior temporal
gyrus/sulcus and left dorsal inferior frontal cortex) in the resting state
was also found to increase with age (from 5 to 6 years old) and language
comprehension ability (Xiao, Friederici, Margulies, & Brauer, 2016).
Different from the traditional point of view that spoken language
processing is mainly located in the left hemisphere, the dual-stream
framework argues that the ventral pathway involves both hemi
spheres, whereas the dorsal pathway mainly involves the left hemi
sphere (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007). A study on developmental differences
in English story listening comprehension showed that there was more
focal activation with age in bilateral superior temporal gyri and no
significant increase in lateralization with age, so the neural basis of
speech comprehension seems to be established in a bilateral network by
late childhood (Lidzba, Schwilling, Grodd, Krageloh-Mann, & Wilke,

2011). In contrast to the dorsal pathway, the current understanding of
the developmental pattern in the ventral pathway is limited.
Spoken language processing is a complicated process involving
cooperation of multiple brain regions, not only the dual-stream
pathway. For example, subcortical regions, such as the basal ganglia
and the thalamus, have been reported to play a crucial role in speech and
language processing (Copland & Angwin, 2019; David, Maess, Eckstein,
& Friederici, 2011; Kotz, Schwartze, & Schmidt-Kassow, 2009;
Krishnan, Watkins, & Bishop, 2016; Lim, Fiez, & Holt, 2014), including
speech perception and speech category learning (Lim, Fiez, & Holt,
2014), prosodic processing (David et al., 2011), and language produc
tion (Kotz, Schwartze, & Schmidt-Kassow, 2009). Some studies have
suggested that subcortical activity serves as an articulatory mechanism
to facilitate sound awareness in phonological processing (Hancock,
Richlan, & Hoeft, 2017), consistent with previous work which demon
strated that reading development was characterized by a shift from
reliance on subcortical to cortical mechanisms (Liu et al., 2018).
Taken together, in the current study, we adopted a graph theorybased network analysis method to investigate developmental changes
in the whole-brain connectivity profile in spoken word processing. We
measured inter regional functional connectivity and nodal degree, with
the former indicating the interaction strength between two brain areas,
and the latter estimating the number of other regions that directly
connect to a particular region (Liu et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2016; Xia, Foxe,
Sroubek, Branch, & Li, 2014). We aimed to examine whether children's
spoken word processing was characterized by a dual-stream dissocia
tion, as shown in adults. Spoken word processing requires the use of
phonological cues to access semantics, and includes auditory-motor and
sound-meaning mapping. Accordingly, we adopted a rhyming judgment
task tapping into phonological processing and a meaning judgment task
tapping into semantic processing to examine developmental differences
in the functional network during spoken word processing. Based on
Interactive Specialization Theory (Johnson, 2001), we expected
specialization of the dual streams to emerge over development, that is,
adults will manifest rhyming vs. meaning task differences in their
functional connectivity profile, while these between-task differences
will not be shown or will be smaller in children. In addition, according to
the developmental evidence on dual-stream model (Booth et al., 2001;
2004; Cao et al., 2011; Xiao, Friederici, Margulies, & Brauer, 2016), we
expected adults to have stronger functional connections and higher
nodal degree than children in the dorsal pathway (e.g., the inferior pa
rietal and dorsal inferior frontal regions) during the rhyming judgment
task. In the meaning judgment task, adults should have stronger func
tional connections and higher nodal degree than children in the ventral
pathway (e.g., left angular gyrus and ventral inferior/middle frontal
regions). Finally, we expected children should rely more on connections
with subcortical regions, consistent with a general mechanism of
subcortical-to-cortical shift in the development of cognitive functions
(Liu et al., 2018).
2. Material and methods
2.1. Participants
Twenty-three young adults and 19 children participated in this
study, three adults and three children were excluded from further ana
lyses due to their extensive head motion, resulting in 20 young adults
between 19 and 26 years old (M = 22.0  1.9, 13 females) and 16
children between 8 and 12 years old (M = 10.5  1.4, 10 females). We
carried out a power analysis, and the results indicated that the total
sample size of 36 participants has a statistical power above 0.69 under
effect size from 0.8 to 1.6, which is shown in detail in Fig. S1. All par
ticipants met the following criteria: 1. No neurological disease or psy
chiatric disorders; 2. Native Chinese speaker; 3. Right-handed; 4.
Normal hearing and normal or corrected to normal vision; 5. Not taking
medication affecting nervous system. All adult participants and the

parent or legal guardian of each child participant gave written informed
consent before the experiment. The study was approved by the Institu
tional Review Board at Beijing Normal University. The demographic
characteristics of the participants and the effect size of behavioral per
formance are shown in Table 1. The two groups were matched in gender
but showed significant differences in IQ and word in noise performance.
Adults also had better performance than children on the rhyming and
meaning judgment tasks.

2.4. Stimulus characteristics
There were 90 pairs of word task stimuli and 30 baseline stimuli
(fixation) randomly presented in each task. In the rhyming task, half of
the pairs rhymed ("yan2 se4" and "men1 re4") and half did not rhyme
("pao3 bu4" and "da2 an4"). In the meaning task, half were semantically
related ("nan2 ji2" (the South Pole) and "qi3 e2" (penguin)) and half were
semantically unrelated ("shu4 zhi1" (tree branch) and "wei2 nan2"
(embarrassment)). All stimuli can be found in Tables S6 and S7. These
word stimuli were selected from Chinese language textbooks for primary
school and were matched for frequency, acquisition term, and number of
strokes across the rhyming and meaning tasks. Semantic association
strength between the two-word stimuli in a pair was assessed using a 7point scale. Thirty-five adults in Beijing were asked to judge to what
extent a pair of words were semantically related. An average score
across subjects below 2.5 was considered unrelated, whereas an average
score over 5.5 was considered related. A red "+" fixation in 2000 ms
duration was used as the baseline stimulus and the participants were
required to do nothing during this period.

2.2. Behavioral tests
2.2.1. Intelligence test
IQ of the two age groups was assessed by the Chinese version
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-CR) (Wechsler, 1974)
and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-RC) (Wechsler, 1955).
2.2.2. Word in noise test
MRI scanning creates loud noises which may influence an in
dividual's rhyming and meaning judgment. To control for individual
differences in basic auditory perception, the participants completed a
word in noise test before scanning, and their scores in this test were used
as a covariate in the analyses. The test consisted of 60 trials. Participants
were asked to repeat what they heard. The pronunciations had different
initial phonemes, rhymes and tones, such as "ba4", "dou1", "fang3" and so
on. Each word was 65 dB, and 350 ms in duration, under four levels of
signal-noise ratio (SNR) (- 6, - 2, +2, +6 dB). Before the test, all par
ticipants performed a practice consisting of 20 trails to familiarize
themselves with the test procedure.

2.5. Image acquisition
Data were collected using a Siemens Trio 3 T magnetic scanner at the
Brain Imaging Center in Beijing Normal University. The functional im
aging data were collected with a susceptibility weighted single-shot
echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with blood oxygenation leveldependent (BOLD) signal recording. Functional scanning parameters
are as follows: TR = 2,000 ms; TE = 20 ms; flip angle = 80 ; slice
thickness = 3 mm; gap = 0.48 mm; number of slices = 32; FOV = 220 x
206 mm; matrix = 128 x 120 x 32; and voxel size = 1.72 x 1.72 x 3.48
mm3. In addition, a high resolution T1 weighted 3D image (MPRAGE)
was acquired with the following parameters: number of axial slices =
160; slice thickness = 1 mm; FOV = 256 mm x 256 mm; matrix = 256 x
256 x 160; voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm3; TR = 2,300 ms; and TE = 3.36
ms.
Participants performed a practice for each task before scanning to
make them familiar with the experimental tasks. The practice contained
20 trials (15 task trials and 5 baseline trials) for rhyming and meaning
judgment task. Participants were provided instructions before the
practice and feedback after the practice to make sure they fully under
stood the tasks. Additionally, child participants were exposed to a
simulated MRI scanner prior to data collection to help them adapt to the
experimental equipment and minimize head motion.

2.3. Experimental design
In the experiment, participants were required to make a rhyming
judgment or a meaning judgment to each pair of Chinese word stimuli
presented auditorily to tap into sound-phonology and sound-meaning
mapping during spoken word processing.
A description appeared on the screen before each run to remind the
participant whether the task was a rhyming or a meaning judgment.
After that, there was an 8 s equilibration time to ensure the stability of
the fMRI signal. Then a white "+" fixation with 300 ms duration
appeared on the screen, indicating the participants that the task would
come soon and that they should concentrate. All Chinese word stimuli
were 800 ms in duration with a 500 ms interval between the two words
in a pair. A red "+" fixation appeared on the screen after the second
stimulus disappeared to indicate to the participants that they should
make a response as quickly and accurately as possible. The response
interval was set as 3,000, 3,250, or 3,500 ms with equal probability.
Participants were required to judge whether the two stimuli in a pair
rhymed (rhyming judgment task) or were semantically related (meaning
judgment task) by pressing yes button for rhyming (or semantically
related) trials using their right index finger or pressing a no button with

2.6. Data pre-processing
The fMRI data were pre-processed using DPARSF (https://rfmri.
org/DPARSF) (Yan & Zang, 2010). Images were pre-processed for the
following steps: First four volumes were deleted to ensure the signal
stability; slice acquisition timing correction was then performed by
interpolating the voxel time series using slice interpolation, and the
middle slice in time was used as a reference slice. Then, subjects with
head movement parameters greater than 3 mm of displacement or 3
degrees of rotation in any direction were excluded from further analyses.
The resulting images were then spatially normalized to the Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) template, resampled to 3 x 3 x 3 mm3
voxel size. Next, all images were smoothed with a 4-mm Gaussian kernel
to decrease spatial noise, and were removed of linear trends. There have
been studies suggesting that brain development is associated with
strengthening of long-range connections and weakening of short-range
connections, but these have been shown to be markedly inflated by
the presence of motion artifact in younger children (Ciric et al., 2017,

2018). Therefore, we regressed out six head motion parameters, white
matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal, and global signal in
subsequent network analysis (Ciric et al., 2017, 2018; Power, Schlaggar,
& Petersen, 2015).

2.8.2. Edge definition
For each participant, edges in the functional brain network were
defined as the Pearson's correlational coefficient across each pair of
nodal task-related time series.
The time series for each node was obtained by averaging the time
series of all the voxels within the node. We only examined the taskrelated time series (Fig. 1B), which were extracted from the onset of
the first word in a pair to 2 TRs after the second word in a pair and
concatenated over trials for each region of interest (ROI) and each
subject to take into account the delay of the signal and participant
response time (Ekman, Derrfuss, Tittgemeyer, & Fiebach, 2012; Liang,
Zou, He, & Yang, 2016; Liu et al., 2018). After this, ninety percent of the
raw time points were available to calculate the regional pair-wise
correlations.

2.7. Univariate analysis
We carried out two univariate analyses to compare group and task
differences in whole-brain activity based on the contrast lexical trials vs.
baseline. Specifically, at the first-level model, the preprocessed func
tional volumes were submitted to a general linear modal (GLM) with
three experimental conditions (correct trials of the task, incorrect trials
of the task and the baseline). The BOLD response for each condition was
modeled with the canonical hemodynamic response function along with
the temporal derivative. Six parameter estimates of head motion were
entered as confounding regressors to correct for potential movement
artifacts. A two-sample or paired sample T-test was applied at the
second-level analysis to generate statistical inferences of group or task
comparisons, respectively. As children performed significantly worse
than adults on the intelligence and word in noise tests, we controlled for
the IQ and word in noise scores in the group comparison. Group by task
interaction was examined using ANOVA. Only results passing the FDR
correction (p  0.05) are reported.

2.8.3. Network construction
The time series of the 90 nodes for each subject under the rhyming
judgment and the meaning judgment task were correlated with each
other (Pearson correlation) to obtain the functional network under each
task for each subject (90 x 90 matrix) (Fig. 1C). We used a surrogate
data permutation test to examine the statistical significance of each edge
(the functional connectivity strength of each pair of brain regions) in the
matrix. First, 1000 surrogate time series were constructed for each
original time series (e.g., node 1) by randomizing the phase of the time
series. Second, the 1000 surrogate time series were related to the orig
inal time series of other nodes in the network (e.g., node 2). Thus, the
correlation between surrogate time series and original time series of
other nodes would form a correlation coefficient distribution. Finally, if
the observed correlation coefficient of two nodes (e.g., node 1 and node
2) was above the 95th percentile of the distribution, we considered that
the observed correlation coefficient was statistically significant (Ebisu
zaki, 1997) (Fig. 1D). This statistical test accounts for time series that are
serially correlated, and circumvents the need to match groups on
network sparsity (Ebisuzaki, 1997).

2.8. Network construction
2.8.1. Node definition
For each participant, nodes in the functional brain network were
defined by partitioning the whole brain (excluding the cerebellum) into
90 regions according to the AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling)
template (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). The whole brain (excluding the
cerebellum) was divided into 90 brain regions. Each brain region rep
resents a node (Fig. 1A).

within each node using the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template; (B) Time courses of Chinese lexical condition of the rhyming and meaning judgment
tasks were extracted for each node, which are illustrated by different colors. The left pair of stimuli is an example for the auditory rhyming task, "" is pronounced
as "yan2 se4", while "" is pronounced as "men1 re4", hence the two words ("" and "") rhyme; the right pair of stimuli is an example for the auditory
meaning task, "" means "the south pole" while "" means "penguins", hence the two words ("" and "") are semantically related; (C) The task-related
network was constructed by correlating task-related time courses to calculate pairwise 90 x 90 matrices for each subject and task; (D) A surrogate time course
analysis was used to estimate the statistical significance for each edge of the task-related network. (E) A union of statistically significant edge maps of both age

2.9. Graph theoretical analysis

score were regressed out in the group comparisons using an ANCOVA.
Multiple comparison corrections were performed using the FDR
correction method at an alpha level of 0.05 (Fig. 1G). We used a similar
method to determine task differences in the functional connectivity by
performing a paired sample T-test to determine edges with significant
task differences for each group. To further test whether one group had
larger task differences than the other group, we carried out a two-way
ANOVA to examine group by task interaction effects.
We examined the FCV differences based on regions identified to
show significant group and task difference respectively, similar as in
aforementioned large-scale functional connectivity analysis.

The graph theoretical analysis was performed in GRETNA
(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gretna/) (Wang et al., 2015). Specif
ically, binary matrices were generated from the task-related connectiv
ity matrix described above for each participant using different sparsity
threshold values. If the observed correlation coefficient was greater than
a given threshold, it was set to 1, otherwise it was set to 0. In order to
control the influence of sparsity on network properties, a sparsity range
(0.06-0.5, with 0.01 step) was chosen and a series of thresholded binary
networks were constructed. We chose this range because the lowest
bound of the threshold range (0.06) guaranteed full connectivity of the
network and the highest bound (0.50) maintained small-world proper
ties of the network according to previous studies (Bassett, MeyerLindenberg, Achard, Duke, & Bullmore, 2006; Liang et al., 2016).
We used this analysis method to evaluate the importance of a specific
node in the network. For this aim, nodal degree and hub were chosen as
two measures as these two have been widely used in previous studies
(Liu et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2016; Sporns, Honey, & Kotter, 2007). The
degree of each node measures the number of edges of the node,
revealing the importance of a particular node in the network. The
greater the degree, the more nodes connected to this node. Hubs are
nodes with high degree (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009). We defined a node
as a hub in the network if the normalized degree of this node was 1.5 SD
greater than the mean degree across all nodes in the network
respectively.

2.11.2. Group and task differences in nodal degree
We calculated the AUC (area under curve) for each node for a range
of sparsity thresholds (Bassett, Nelson, Mueller, Camchong, & Lim,
2012), and then used two sample T-tests (group differences) or paired
sample T-tests (task differences) to find out the nodes showing signifi
cant group or task differences. IQ and the word in noise test were used as
covariates in between-group analysis. Finally, an FDR correction at an
alpha level of 0.05 was conducted to correct for multiple comparisons.
Similarly, a two-way ANOVA analysis was used to examine the group by
task interaction effects to further test whether one group had larger task
differences than the other group.
2.11.3. Test-retest reliability assessment
To assess test-retest reliability of the functional connectivity and
nodal degree measurements, we calculated intra-class correlation co
efficients (ICC) between even and odd trials within each task sequence
(Birn et al., 2013; Zhang, Baum, Adduru, Biswal, & Michael, 2018; Zuo
& Xing, 2014). Here, ICC values close to 1 indicate perfect agreement,
while ICC values close to 0 (or negative) indicate poor or no agreement,
with an ICC value from 0 to 0.25 indicating poor reliability, 0.25 to 0.40
indicating low reliability, 0.40 to 0.60 indicating fair reliability, 0.60 to
0.75 indicating good reliability and 0.75 to 1.00 indicating excellent
reliability (Xiang et al., 2019). We kept measurements whose agreement
between odd and even trials are above 0.60 to regard them as relatively
reliable results.

2.10. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis
To further investigate time-varied characteristics in the aforemen
tioned task-related network construction, we carried out a dynamic
functional connectivity analysis. Specifically, time-varying functional
networks was estimated by computing correlations across 90 ROI time
courses using a series of sliding windows (window size: 57 time points;
window step: 3 time points). The choice of the window size has long
been a matter of debate, especially in resting-state analysis. There ap
pears to be a tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity (Preti, Bolton,
& Van De Ville, 2017), specifically, a small window size yields improved
sensitivity to temporal changes but at the cost of introducing spurious
fluctuations and sacrificing reliability because of too few samples, while
a larger window size is less sensitive to detect the temporal variation
(Preti et al., 2017; Savva, Mitsis, & Matsopoulos, 2019). In task-based
fMRI, the sensitivity issue is better than resting state because in
dividuals are involved during scanning. Therefore, we adopted a rela
tively larger window size to guarantee the reliability of temporal
variation. There were 285 time points in each task sequence, and we
chose a window size as 57 time points (around 19 task trials), with a
window step of 3 time points (about one task trial), with 95 percent
overlapping rate. Finally, we obtained 77 networks for each participant
in each task, and then evaluated the degree of functional connectivity
variability (FCV) to identify more variable (or flexible) edges during task
processing.

2.11.4. Group difference in hub overlapping rate
We calculated how much the hub distribution overlapped across the
two tasks for the adults and children. If one node appeared as a hub in
the networks of both tasks, then it was regarded as an overlapping hub.
The number of overlapping hubs was divided by the total number of
hubs, to estimate the overlap rate of each participant in two tasks. A twosample T-test was used to determine group differences in the overlap
rate across tasks in order to compare task specificity of the functional
networks in the adult versus child groups.
3. Results
3.1. Behavioral performance
Table 1 illustrates demographic information, IQ, in-scanner behav
ioral performance for the rhyming and meaning judgment tasks, outscanner word in noise scores for the adults and children. Two-sample
T-test and paired sample T-test were used to estimate group and task
differences respectively. For the group difference, adults showed faster
reaction time (Rhyming Task = 1902 ms; Meaning Task = 1799 ms) and
higher response accuracy (Rhyming Task = 89.9%; Meaning Task =
91.9%) than children (reaction time: Rhyming Task = 2161 ms, Mean
ing Task = 1991 ms; response accuracy: Rhyming Task = 69.4%,
Meaning Task = 82.1%) in both tasks. As shown in Table 1, adults also
had higher IQ and word in noise scores than children. We carried out an
ANCOVA analysis by controlling for IQ and word in noise scores for
group comparisons of response accuracy and reaction time in both tasks,
and the results indicated that adults still performed better than children

2.11. Statistical analysis
2.11.1. Group and task differences in large-scale functional connectivity
and FCV
We compared the differences in group and task only on the signifi
cant edges of the task-related network. In addition, because the physi
ological significance of negative connections is still unclear, this study
only focused on positive correlations (Fox, Zhang, Snyder, & Raichle,
2009; Murphy, Birn, Handwerker, Jones, & Bandettini, 2009). For group
comparisons, we first identified the significant edges either in the adult
group or in the child group, that is, the union of significant edges of both
groups (Fig. 1E). Then, a two-sample T-test was performed to determine
the between-group difference (Fig. 1F). IQ and the word in noise test

found to pass p  0.05 (FDR correction).

(rhyming judgment task accuracy: F(1,34) = 27.18, p < 0.001, reaction
time: F(1,34) = 5.48, p = 0.025; meaning judgment task accuracy: F
(1,34) = 4.81, p = 0.028, reaction time: F(1,34) = 3.39, p = 0.041).
No task differences were found on in-scanner behavioral perfor
mance of adults (reaction time: T (19) = 1.67; p = 0.110, response ac
curacy: T(19) = - 1.22; p = 0.240). However, children showed a
significant between task difference in response accuracy (T(15) =
- 4.28; p < 0.001), i.e., the accuracy of the meaning judgment task
(82.1%) was significantly higher than that of the rhyming judgment task
(69.4%). There was a marginally significant task difference in the re
action time for the children (T (15) = 2.07; p = 0.060).

3.3. Group and task differences in large-scale functional connectivity
The significant functional connections under each task of the adult
and child groups are shown in Fig. S2. Follow-up large-scale functional
connectivity analysis was based on the significant connections in a
combination of either group or task. We carried out two sample T-tests
to compare between-groups in functional connectivity for the rhyming
and meaning judgment tasks, and regressed out IQ and word in noise test
scores. A multiple comparison correction was performed using the FDR
correction (p  0.05). We only kept functional connections in which ICC
was above 0.60 to be regarded as relatively reliable results, which are
shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2. The effect size (Cohen's d) of group on
functional connectivity strength are above 0.90.
In the rhyming judgment task, the strength of the functional con
nectivity of the adults in the dorsal stream was significantly higher than
that of the children, including the connections between left inferior
parietal lobule (IPL) and bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG), and within
the left IFG (between triangularis part and opercular part). In addition,
adults had stronger functional connectivity between right para
hippocampal gyrus (PHG) and right temporal pole of the middle tem
poral gyrus (TPOmid), and between right superior frontal gyrus (SFG)
and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG). In contrast, children showed higher
functional connectivity between the right Rolandic operculum (ROL)
and bilateral primary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus, HES), and within
temporal pole (between superior and middle temporal pole). Further
more, FCV analysis showed that the functional connectivity strength
between triangularis and opercular part of the left IFG in the child group
had more variation than in adult group (FCV of Children = 0.010, FCV of
Adults = 0.003, p = 0.009), suggesting that children's connectivity be
tween these two regions was more inconsistent and unstable over task
performance. Altogether, the adults had greater and more consistent
connectivity than did the children between the triangularis and oper
cular parts of the left IFG.
In the meaning judgment task, the adult group showed stronger
functional connectivity than the child group between the bilateral
angular gyri (ANG) and orbital part of the bilateral middle frontal gyri
(ORBmid), within bilateral SFG, and between right middle occipital

3.2. Group and task differences in univariate regional activity
The group comparison results are shown in Table S1. In both tasks,
adults showed greater activity than children in occipito-temporal cortex
(e.g., fusiform gyrus in the rhyming judgment task; superior occipital
gyrus and fusiform gyrus in the meaning judgment task). In contrast,
children had greater activity than adults in subcortical regions (i.e.,
putamen) in the rhyming judgment task, and in some motor represen
tation areas (e.g., precentral gyrus and supplementary motor area) in the
meaning judgment task.
Table S2 illustrates the task comparison results for both age groups.
In the adult group, the rhyming task triggered greater activity in middle
frontal gyrus and temporal pole of middle temporal gyrus, as well as
putamen, while the meaning judgment task triggered greater activity in
occipito-temporal areas (inferior temporal gyrus and lingual gyrus). In
the child group, the rhyming task triggered greater activity on insula and
subcortical areas (i.e., putamen), while no meaning greater than
rhyming effect was observed.
There were four clusters manifesting significant group by task
interaction effects (p < 0.001, voxel size > 10), as shown in Table S3. We
carried out further post hoc tests, and found that the right postcentral
gyrus showed a meaning greater than rhyming effect in the adult group,
but a rhyming greater than meaning effect in the child group. The
remaining three clusters (the bilateral putamen and the left superior
frontal gyrus) showed a reverse pattern: the adult group had a rhyming
greater than meaning effect, whereas the child group had a meaning
greater than rhyming effect. However, none of these above results was

Taken together, the strength of this functional connectivity was weaker
in the children than in the adults, however, fluctuation of this connec
tivity in the children was greater than in the adults. In other words, the
adults had greater and consistent connectivity between the left ORBmid
and ANG than the children did in the meaning judgment task.
We also calculated between task differences in the functional con
nectivity in the adults and children separately (p  0.05, FDR-corrected,
ICC > 0.60). Only the adult group showed between task differences. As
shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3, compared with the meaning judgment task,
the rhyming judgment task was more dependent on the dorsal pathway.
Specifically, stronger connections were found in the rhyming than the
meaning task between bilateral IFG (the opercular and triangular parts)
and IPL, and between the bilateral rectus gyri (REC). In contrast, the
meaning judgment task was more dependent on the ventral pathway.
Specifically, stronger connections were found in the meaning than the
rhyming task between the orbital part of the left IFG and TPOsup, and
between opercular and orbital part of the IFG. Additionally, the meaning
task showed stronger connections than the rhyming task between the
two left occipital visual areas, i.e. between superior occipital gyrus
(SOG) and MOG.
As shown in Fig. 4, four pairs of regions manifested significant group
by task interaction effects (FDR-corrected, p  0.05). The task differ
ences in the adult group were significantly larger than in the child group
(for connectivity between the left opercular part of IFG and IPL: F(1,60)

= 1.92, p = 0.049; for connectivity between the left triangular part of
IFG and IPL: F(1,60) = 2.1, p = 0.031; for connectivity between left SOG
and MOG: F(1,60) = 1.91, p = 0.050; for connectivity between left
orbital part of IFG and TPOsup: F(1,60) = 2.15, p = 0.027).
3.4. Group and task differences in nodal degree
The results of the group differences in nodal degree are shown in
Table 4 and Fig. 5, similar as the functional connectivity analysis, we
regarded ICCs above 0.60 as reliable results. In the rhyming judgment
task, adults had higher nodal degree than children in the right PHG and
left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), while children showed greater nodal de
gree in bilateral anterior cingulum and subcortical areas (putamen and
pallidum). In the meaning judgment task, adults had higher nodal de
gree in left TPOmid; in contrast, children showed greater nodal degree in
right anterior cingulum and subcortical pallidum.
Similar to task differences in the functional connectivity analysis,
only adults showed significant task differences in the nodal degree, as
shown in Table 5 and Fig. 6. Specifically, the rhyming judgment task had
higher nodal degree than the meaning task in the left SFG, while the
meaning judgment task had higher nodal degree than the rhyming task
in the right ANG. However, the two-way ANOVA analysis indicated that
the group by task interaction effects of these two regions were not sig
nificant (left superior frontal gyrus, medial orbital part: F(1,60) = 0.57,

In this study, we examined the differences in large scale brain
functional networks between adults and children during two Chinese
spoken word processing tasks. Specifically, we used rhyming judgment
and meaning judgment tasks to examine the developmental differences
in sound-phonology mapping and sound-semantic mapping respec
tively. The main findings are as follows. First, compared with children,
phonological processing in adults relied more on the dorsal pathway
including inferior frontal gyrus and the parietal-temporal area, whereas
semantic processing in adults relied more on the ventral pathway of
inferior temporal cortex and occipital areas. Children failed to show this
dorsal versus ventral dissociation by showing no task difference in both
functional connectivity and nodal degree, as well as high hub overlap
rate across the two tasks, suggesting the dual streams for spoken word
processing becomes more specialized over development. Second,
compared with adults, both phonological and semantic processing of
children relied more on Heschl's gyrus and superior temporal gyrus
involved in basic auditory processing and Rolandic operculum

cortical regions. Children had seven hubs, all of them located either in
subcortical areas or in insular cortex.
In the adults, left REC and right PHG are common hubs across the
two tasks. In contrast, in the children, almost all the hubs of the two
tasks were overlapping. We calculated an overlap rate of the hubs across
the two tasks for adults and children. We found that the overlap rate of
children across two tasks (42.0%) was significantly higher than that of
adults (26.2%) (T(34) = - 2.065, p = 0.047).
These results were verified by defining hubs as 1 SD greater than the
mean degree across all nodes in the network, as shown in Table S5. In
the rhyming judgment task, cortical regions occupied the majority
(70.6%) of the hubs in adults, whereas 50% of hubs were located in

processing relied more on subcortical regions compared with adults.

phonetic classification (Alho et al., 2016; Osnes et al., 2012), whereas
the inferior parietal lobule is related to the sensorimotor integration in
speech production (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007). Both of these regions
belong to the dorsal pathway in the dual-stream model (Hickok &
Poeppel, 2004; 2007; Hickok et al., 2011), which is responsible for
auditory-motor integration. Our finding is consistent with previous
developmental research on auditory phonological processing, that is, the
involvement of dorsal pathway in phonological processing increased
with age, which is not only reflected in the activation of these dorsal
regions (Booth et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2011), but also reflected in

4.1. Spoken word processing development is characterized by increased
dissociation between dorsal and ventral pathways
Adults manifested stronger functional connectivity strength than
children in the rhyming judgment task between bilateral inferior frontal
gyri and left inferior parietal lobule. In the process of spoken word
processing, the inferior frontal gyrus is considered to be related to
11

X. Liu et al.

resting-state functional connectivity strength between these regions
(Xiao et al., 2016). Moreover, we provided further evidence showing
that adults had more consistent functional connectivity than children
between the triangularis and opercular part of the left IFG, indicating
they had more reliable and less varied phonetic processing.
As for the meaning judgment task, functional connectivity strength
between bilateral orbital part of middle frontal gyrus and angular gyrus,
as well as between right middle occipital gyrus and fusiform gyrus, in
adults was greater than in children. Additionally, adults depended more
on the left middle temporal cortex (temporal pole) revealed by age
differences in nodal degree. Angular gyrus is an important region in
semantic system and plays a critical role in complex information inte
gration and knowledge retrieval (Binder et al., 2009). As proposed in
dual-stream model, the ventral stream mainly includes the middle and
inferior temporal cortex extending into the angular gyrus, which is
responsible for the sound to meaning integration (Hickok & Poeppel,
2004; 2007). Moreover, FCV analysis showed that the functional con
nectivity strength between the orbital part of left middle frontal gyrus
and angular gyrus in children was more varied than in adults, indicating
adults had not only greater but also more consistent connectivity be
tween the left ORBmid and ANG. It should be noted that we found the
adult group, compared to the child group, relied more on occipital
cortex (e.g. greater connectivity strength between middle occipital gyrus
and fusiform gyrus) in the meaning judgment task. This is consistent
with previous evidence indicating that the development of processing
the meaning of Chinese is characterized by increasing reliance on visualspatial processing in the occipital regions (Cao et al., 2009). This might
reflect experience in reading Chinese. Written Chinese is a logographic
system, and its orthography indicates meaning systematically. Hence,
adults with richer written Chinese experience may be able to recruit the
visual orthographic representation areas to facilitate meaning judgment
to spoken words (Cao, Brennan, & Booth, 2015).
We also found that only the adult group showed between-task dif
ferences in large-scale functional connectivity and nodal degree,
whereas children did not show a dorsal versus ventral dissociation under
different task demands. Our data suggest that the development of the
spoken word processing network is characterized by emergence of the
specialization of the ventral and dorsal streams. More generally, our
findings support the interactive specialization perspective of cognitive
development (Johnson, 2011). The development of a cognitive skill is
supported by the interaction pattern among multiple brain regions,
which results in the emergence of specialized brain regions for meeting
task requirements.
In general, our results for the adult group are consistent with Hickok
and Poeppel's model (2007; 2011; 2020). Specifically, in the rhyming
compared to the meaning judgment task, adults showed greater activity
in right middle frontal gyrus, and greater connectivity strength between
bilateral inferior frontal gyri and inferior parietal lobule. Middle and
inferior frontal gyri, as well as the inferior parietal lobule act as artic
ulatory hubs in the dorsal stream proposed by Hickok and Poeppel
(Hickok & Poeppel, 2007; Hickok et al., 2011). However, in the meaning
compared to the rhyming judgment task, adults manifested greater ac
tivity in left inferior temporal gyrus and right lingual gyrus, and greater
connectivity strength between left inferior frontal gyrus and the tem
poral pole (i.e. superior temporal gyrus). They also showed greater de
gree in the right angular gyrus. The inferior temporal cortex, temporal
pole, and angular gyrus are described as regions located in the ventral
pathway involved in lexical conceptual representations (Hickok &
Poeppel, 2007; Hickok et al., 2011; Matchin & Hickok, 2020).
Despite the similarity, there are some differences between our results
and Hickock and Poeppel's model (2007, 2011, 2020). Our results
demonstrated that adults showed a greater reliance on occipital regions
(e.g., greater functional connectivity strength between left middle and
superior occipital gyri) in the meaning compared to the rhyming judg
ment task. As indicated earlier, this might due to the characteristics of
the Chinese writing system, that is, the orthography to semantic

mapping is more systematic than the orthography to phonology map
ping. Spoken Chinese is also highly homophonic, and therefore, Chinese
comprehension requires the establishment of mappings between the
spoken syllables and orthographic word forms (Cao, Brennan, & Booth,
2015). Of note, Hickok and Poeppel's model is based on brain activation
indices, while our results are mainly based on functional connectivity.
Therefore, the slight differences can also be explained by the method
ological differences, apart from the language heterogeneity.
4.2. Spoken word processing development is characterized by decreased
reliance on sensory-motor pathways
Our findings indicate that spoken word processing in children relied
more on sensory-motor cortical processing as compared to adults.
Children had stronger functional connections between left Heschl's
gyrus and right Rolandic operculum in the rhyming judgment task.
Similarly, in the meaning judgment task, children had stronger func
tional connections between bilateral superior temporal gyri and right
Rolandic operculum. Heschl's gyrus is an important basic acoustic
processing area (Altarelli et al., 2014; Cardin et al., 2016; Warrier et al.,
2009), and is involved in prelexical processing of auditory speech (Price,
2010). The Rolandic operculum is primarily related to the tongue and
muscle movements involved in oral speech processing and initiation of
articulation (Brown et al., 2009). Taken together, our findings suggest
that compared with adults, children relied more on basic auditory pro
cessing and representations of motor articulation. Dependence on
frontal motor articulation representations may be a mechanism adopted
by aging individuals (Du, Buchsbaum, Grady, & Alain, 2016; Tremblay,
2017), and stutterers (Biermann-Ruben, Salmelin, & Schnitzler, 2005),
so our results suggest that children adopt a less efficient mechanism for
spoken word processing.
Our findings also showed that children's spoken word processing
relied more on the subcortical articulation pathway as compared to
adults. For example, all hubs in the children were located in subcortical
areas in both tasks, and children manifested greater nodal degree than
adults in putamen and pallidum in both tasks. In addition, children
compared to adults had greater connectivity strength between right
putamen and Heschl's gyrus in the meaning judgment task. There is
growing fMRI evidence showing that the subcortical circuit is involved
in language processing and learning (Copland & Angwin, 2019; Han
cock, Richlan, & Hoeft, 2017; Krishnan, Watkins, & Bishop, 2016; Liu
et al., 2018). Krishnan et al (2016) proposed that the cortico-striatal
system is responsive to motor and sequential demands in word
learning, suggesting that striatal activity may be a compensatory
mechanism in phonological and semantic processing (see Krishnan
et al., 2016, for a review). This view is supported by a meta-analysis
reviewing the role of fronto-striatal circuits in reading disorder, which
proposed that subcortical regions (i.e., putamen, thalamus, and caudate)
serve as an articulatory compensation to facilitate sound awareness as
children learn to read. However, by adulthood, the reliance on articu
latory processing may be diminished by experience (Hancock et al.,
2017). According to the TRACE model, speech processing involves both
top-down and bottom-up processing (McClelland & Elman, 1986). There
is convincing evidence for top-down effects, with studies showing that
lexical information facilitates speech perception (McClelland et al.,
2006). This top-down effects seem to increase with age, as children have
been shown to be less proficient in using top-down processing strategies
in consonant-vowel syllable perception (Andersson et al., 2008). In line
with these studies, we argue that the greater reliance on inferior frontal
and parietal areas in the adult group indicates greater top-down pro
cessing. However, the reliance on basic auditory and motor processing
areas in the child group may indicate a bottom-up compensation. Other
studies have suggested that the sensorimotor system may aid in chil
dren's word processing (Cychosz et al., 2021). Greater dependency on
subcortical regions in children than adults has also been reported in
task-free resting-state studies (Cao et al., 2014; Jolles et al., 2011),

suggesting this trend may also possibly reflect a domain general devel
opmental mechanism.

5. Conclusions

References

Our study showed that the development of spoken word processing is
characterized by increased reliance on the dorsal pathway for phono
logical processing, and increased reliance on the ventral pathway for
semantic processing, supporting the dual-stream framework (Hickok &
Poeppel, 2004; 2007), while children failed to show a dorsal versus
ventral dissociation in the phonological versus semantic task compari
son. Instead, the children manifested greater involvement of sensorymotor regions than the adults in both tasks, suggesting the develop
ment of functional neural underpinnings in spoken word processing is
characterized by increased specialization.
Limitations and future directions
There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, the sample size of the
current study is relatively small, especially in the child group. To reduce
the impact of this limitation on the replication of the results, we carried
out a test-retest reliability analysis on the functional connectivity and
nodal degree measurements. We also demonstrated that the achieved
statistical power was acceptable (more than 0.70) under the current
effect size. However, future research should examine whether our re
sults are robust in a larger sample size. Secondly, to ensure a sufficient
number of trials, we used correct and incorrect trials to construct the
functional network. Future work should separate these trial types to
examine error-related processes for the incorrect trials. Thirdly, our
cross-sectional study may be affected by cohort effects and did not
compare children of different ages, so longitudinal studies are needed to
better characterize the developmental trends in the functional brain
network of spoken language processing.
