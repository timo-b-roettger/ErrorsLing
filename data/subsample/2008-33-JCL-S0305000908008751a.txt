ABSTRACT

Two studies test the hypotheses that individual differences in
phonological memory among children younger than two years can
be assessed using a non-word repetition task (NWR) and that these
differences are related to the children's rates of vocabulary development.
NWR accuracy, real word repetition accuracy and productive vocabulary
were assessed in 15 children between 1; 9 and 2;0 in Study 1 and in
21 children between 1; 8 and 2 ; 0 in Study 2. In both studies, NWR
accuracy was significantly related to vocabulary percentile and, furthermore, uniquely accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in
vocabulary when real word repetition accuracy was held constant. The
findings establish NWR as a valid measure of phonological memory in
very young children, and they open the door for further studies of the
role of phonological memory in early word learning.

The rate at which children build their vocabularies varies from child to child
and changes with development as a result of factors that are not completely
understood. Studies of children three years and older suggest that
phonological memory is a component of word learning skill, but the
hypothesis that phonological memory plays a role in very early lexical
development has been relatively unexplored. We outline here the rationale
and empirical evidence for this hypothesis, and we report two studies which
establish a method for further research.

Part of the word learning task consists of forming lexical entries for newly
encountered words, and several findings in the literature suggest that this
learning of word forms (apart from learning word meanings) contributes to
the time it takes children to build their lexicons. One relevant finding is that
familiar sound sequences are more easily learned as new words than are
unfamiliar sound sequences. Swingley (2007) found, with children aged 1;6,
that making word forms familiar through exposure prior to a word learning
task resulted in those forms being learned as new words more rapidly than
unfamiliar forms. Storkel (2001) found, with children between three and six
years, that novel words made up of common sound sequences were easier to
learn than novel words made up of rare sound sequences.
A second relevant finding, supported by a large body of research, is that
individual differences in phonological memory (i.e. memory for sound
sequences) are related to individual differences in word learning ability
(Gathercole, 2006). For example, measures of phonological memory are
correlated with three- to five-year-old children's word learning in a
laboratory setting and, in longitudinal studies, phonological memory skills
predict actual vocabulary growth (see Gathercole, 2006). Also, among
adolescent foreign language learners, phonological memory is related to
success at vocabulary learning in the new language (Service & Kohonen,
1995), and poor phonological memory skills are characteristic of children
with atypical language development, who characteristically have small
vocabularies for their age (see Coady & Evans, 2008).
Despite the evidence that phonological memory is one component of word
learning ability, this ability and its role in word learning has been studied
relatively little in children who are the most prodigious word learners -
children between one and three years. Most previous studies of phonological
memory and its relation to word learning have focused on children four
years and older, and none, to our knowledge, have looked at children younger
than two years. Thus, we know relatively little about phonological memory
and its relation to vocabulary development during the period of time when
children's vocabularies are growing rapidly and their phonological
representations are also developing.
There is reason to think that changes in phonological representations
occurring in this early period may affect children's phonological memory
skills. Although phonological memory was first conceptualized as an
unlearned, unchanging cognitive capacity (Baddeley, Gathercole & Papagano,
1998), more recent treatments incorporate the idea that phonological
memory relies on the quality of children's phonological representations
(Gathercole, 2006). In fact, several sorts of findings support the idea
that phonological memory capacity depends on underlying phonological
representations and may therefore change with phonological development.
At five years, children who are better at identifying phonemes and producing
904

NONWORD REPETITION BEFORE AGE TWO

rhymes show better phonological memory skills (Bowey, 2001), and adults
show better memory for sound sequences that conform to the language they
know than for sound sequences in a foreign language (Service & Kohonen,
1995). This should not be surprising, as memory capacity in other domains
has been shown to depend on a representation system for encoding the
to-be-remembered stimuli. For example, adults are better at repeating word
sequences that conform to grammatical rules than anomalous word
sequences (Miller & Isard, 1963), and chess experts are better at
remembering possible middle-game configurations of chess pieces than
random arrangement of chess pieces (Chase & Simon, 1973).
Taken together, the evidence that word learning depends on phonological
memory and that phonological memory depends on phonological knowledge
suggests that children's word learning depends, to a degree, on the
phonological knowledge they have achieved. That is, phonological memory,
as the capacity to learn new word forms, is one link between phonological
knowledge and word learning. Put another way, the hypothesis is that
children who are more advanced in phonological development have more
robust phonological representations and are therefore better able to
remember new word forms as they encounter them, which in turn supports
word learning. This hypothesis is consistent with Werker & Curtin's (2005)
proposal that the emergence of phonemic representations during the second
year of life contributes to the word learning explosion seen in that period.
This hypothesized link between the development of phonological
representations and phonological memory would provide an explanatory
mechanism for other relations that have been observed between children's
phonological development and lexical development. These relations include
lexical selection effects in children's early vocabularies, which result in
earlier-acquired phonemes being over-represented in first words (see
Stoel-Gammon & Sosa, 2007), and within-child effects of early phonological
development, which result in words that conform to a child's phonology
being more readily learned than words that do not (Leonard, Schwartz,
Morris & Chapman, 1981). Also, children with larger phonetic inventories
tend to have larger vocabularies (Stoel-Gammon & Sosa, 2007), and
the phonological properties of the speech produced by lexically precocious
two-year-olds are more advanced than the phonological properties of the
speech produced by two-year-olds with vocabularies more typical for their
age (Smith, McGregor & DeMille, 2006). Although these findings all are
evidence that lexical development is supported by the children's growing
phonological knowledge, they do not explain how phonological knowledge
might actually provide support. Phonological memory is a candidate
mediating mechanism.
Investigating the role of phonological memory in early lexical development
requires a means of measuring phonological memory in very young children.
905

H O F F E T A L.

The most widely used measure of phonological memory capacity is the
non-word repetition task (Coady & Evans, 2008 ; Gathercole, 2006).
Accuracy of non-word repetition (NWR) has been found to be independently
associated with language development when auditory memory and
intelligence are also measured and to be more strongly associated with
language skills than another verbal memory task, digit span (Gathercole,
2006). Non-word repetition tasks also have high sensitivity for language
impairment and even identify adolescents whose earlier language impairments
had resolved (Stothard, Snowling, Bishop, Chipchase & Kaplan, 1998).
The use of non-word repetition as a measure of phonological memory is
not without controversy, however. NWR has been criticized as not providing
a ` pure ' measure of phonological memory because the task requires multiple
abilities. One proposal is that that non-word repetition measures a
phonological processing ability that underlies both the repetition task and
other phonological skills. Other abilities proposed to contribute to non-word
repetition accuracy include speech perception, phonological encoding,
phonological assembly and articulation (see Coady & Evans, 2008). None
of these proposals is damaging to the current hypothesis that NWR taps an
underlying ability that depends on phonological knowledge and is recruited
for word learning, except the proposal that NWR measures articulation skill.
Although articulation has been argued to reflect underlying phonological
representations (Gierut, 1998 ; Rvachew, Ohberg, Grawburg & Heyding,
2003), it also reflects peripheral motoric limitations - particularly in children
under two years. That notwithstanding, the few studies that have looked at
NWR in children under three years suggest that NWR accuracy also reflects
something other than articulation skill, even in children this young
(Gathercole & Adams, 1993 ; Chiat & Roy, 2007). The aim of the present
studies was to pursue the hypothesis that NWR taps a memory ability that is
required by the word learning process in very young word learners.
The present studies were designed to accomplish the following: (1) to
develop a procedure for assessing non-word repetition in younger children
than existing procedures allow ; (2) to establish its validity as a measure of the
capacity to remember speech sound sequences separate from the ability to
articulate those sounds ; and (3) to establish its concurrent relation with
vocabulary development. In two studies, children younger than two years
were administered an NWR task and their vocabulary development was
assessed. To address the concern that inaccuracies in non-word repetition
might reflect problems with articulation rather than memory, the children
were also administered a test of real word repetition accuracy, on the logic
that real words can be remembered with reference to pre-existing lexical
entries but non-words cannot - at least not as easily or completely. The
phonemes in real words should not, however, be easier to articulate than
the phonemes in non-words. Thus, to the degree that children showed
906

NONWORD REPETITION BEFORE AGE TWO

inaccuracy in non-word repetition that they did not show in real word
repetition, inaccuracy in non-word repetition can be taken as a phonological
memory failure, not articulation failure.
STUDY 1
METHOD

Participants
Fifteen monolingual English-learning children, 6 boys and 9 girls, participated. One additional child was tested, but those data were not included
because the child did not attempt to repeat any of the non-words presented.
The participants ranged in age from 1; 9 to 2; 0 (Mean age in months=22.81,
SD=0.64). They were recruited through word-of-mouth and flyers posted at
places with programs for mothers and young children.
Procedure
The real and non-word repetition tasks were administered in a toy play
activity with the examiner in a laboratory playroom. For the real word
repetition task, the examiner presented toys one at a time and asked the
children to repeat the labels for the real word stimuli (e.g. `This is a butterfly ;
Can you say butterfly ?'). For the non-word repetition task the examiner
presented toy animals or people and presented the stimuli as names (e.g.
` This is clird; Can you say clird? '). The examiner presented each stimulus
up to three times. If the child made no attempt to repeat after the third
presentation, the examiner moved to the next stimulus. Two additional
attempts at repetition were allowed in order to minimize data loss due to the
fluctuations in attention that are characteristic of young children. In order to
maximize children's engagement, the stimuli were presented live and in the
context of a fairly natural naming game, rather than using prerecorded
stimuli or with the examiner covering her mouth, as is sometimes done in
testing older children. Chiat & Roy (2007) similarly used live presentation
without covering the mouth in their procedure designed for use with two- to
four-year-olds. If children do make use of visual cues in non-word repetition,
then they should similarly make use of visual cues in encoding novel sound
sequences as part of word learning, and that ability is what we wish to tap in
the present procedure. The child's primary caregiver filled out the
MacArthur (now the MacArthur-Bates) Communicative Development
Inventory : Words and Sentences (CDI ; Fenson et al., 1993). The procedure
was videotaped. The child's mother sat in the room, filling out the CDI and a
background questionnaire during the procedure. Mothers were instructed
not to participate and for the most part cooperated. No mother presented any
stimuli.
907

H O F F E T A L.

Stimuli
The non-word stimuli were derived from previous work with older children
(Gathercole, Willis, Emslie & Baddeley, 1991), but using fewer stimuli and
eliminating the 4-syllable non-words to accommodate the younger
participants of the present study. The resultant list of non-word stimuli
included 3 1-syllable, 3 2-syllable, and 3 3-syllable non-words. Real words
were selected from the CDI for children aged 1;4 to 2;6 so that they were
likely to be words in the children's experience, although not necessarily in
their productive vocabularies. The real words were selected to correspond to
the non-words in terms of length in syllables and approximate phoneme
difficulty (stimuli are provided in Appendix A). Phonotactic probability is
another feature of word and non-word stimuli that has been shown to affect
accuracy of repetition (Coady & Aslin, 2004). The mean phonotactic
probability of the stimuli was 0.013 for real words and 0.021 for non-words,
calculated following Vitevitch & Luce (2004). These means were not
significantly different (t=1.35, p=0.20, two-tailed), indicating that the
frequency with which adjacent phonemes in the stimuli appear as adjacent
phonemes in real English words did not differ between the real word and the
non-word stimuli. Digit span, which is a frequently used measure of auditory
memory with older children, was not used here because for children this age
it is not clear whether digit span would tap memory for real words or
non-words, and, in any case, the phonological properties of digit names could
not be controlled.
Measures
Repetitions of real and non-words were transcribed using broad IPA
transcription by the second author, a trained phonologist. To calculate
inter-rater reliability, a graduate student trained in phonetic transcription
transcribed data from one randomly selected subject (10 % of the total data)
from the data collection sessions. Point-by-point inter-rater reliability was
calculated to be 86 % agreement (33/39 total consonants transcribed), using
procedures described in Shriberg, Lewis, McSweeny & Wilson (1997). Based
on the second author's transcriptions, average percent consonants correct
(PCC) for each set of words and non-words was calculated for each child.
PCC was chosen as the measure of accuracy of production to maximize
reliability of scoring. Transcription of vowels is generally regarded as more
difficult than transcription of consonants due to variation in perception
among transcribers and variability of production in young children. Only
words and non-words that the child attempted to repeat were included in
the calculations. This decision was based on the following logic : if children
do not attempt to repeat a presented word or non-word for reasons of
inattention or reticence that have nothing to do with repetition ability,

then non-attempts are not relevant data and should be excluded. If, in
contrast, children do not attempt to repeat a sequence because they realize
they cannot do so accurately, then the decision not to score non-attempts
will have the effect of reducing variability in the measure of NWR accuracy,
thus reducing the power of the study. It is, therefore, the conservative
approach to scoring. (This topic is considered again in the method section
for Study 2.) Vocabulary percentile was calculated for each child from
the CDI norms. The current hypothesis, that phonological memory
skills are related to word learning ability, makes vocabulary percentile,
rather than raw score, the appropriate outcome measures. In the present
sample, in fact, the age range was so narrow that raw vocabulary score
and vocabulary percentile were almost perfectly correlated (r (n=15)=
0.95).

RESULTS

The mean vocabulary percentile for the participants was 63.27 (SD=26.74).
Mean repetition accuracy for real words was 51.07% (SD=16.55), and
for non-words it was 42.2% (SD=17.66). This difference was statistically
significant (t (14)=2.75, p=0.008, one-tailed, gp2=0.351). The intercorrelations among real word repetition accuracy, non-word repetition
accuracy and vocabulary percentile are presented in Table 1. All correlations
were significant.
To provide the most stringent test of the hypothesis that the capacity to
meet the memory demands and not the articulatory demands of repetition
underlay the correlation between NWR and vocabulary, a partial correlation
between children's non-word repetition accuracy and vocabulary percentile,
removing the variance shared with real word repetition accuracy, was
calculated. This calculation revealed that non-word repetition accuracy
uniquely accounted for 20 % of the variance in vocabulary percentile (r (12)=
0.45). This effect size is substantial, but given the small sample size, the
partial correlation did not reach the conventional 0.05 level of significance
(p=0.055, one-tailed).

DISCUSSION

The finding that real word repetition was more accurate than non-word
repetition supports the assumption that the memory demands of the real
word repetition task were less than the memory demands of the non-word
repetition task. Put another way, non-word repetition required something
more than did the real word repetition task. Individual differences in that
` something more' are captured in these data in the form of the variance in
non-word repetition accuracy not explained by real word repetition accuracy.
That residual variance accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in
vocabulary size, suggesting that the capacity to remember meaningless sound
sequences is a component of word learning skill.
The non-word repetition task probably also taps other capacities that are
used for word learning, and these were also partialled out of the variance in
NWR accuracy when real word repetition accuracy was held constant. That
is, although the partialling of real word repetition accuracy was done in order
to remove irrelevant variance in articulation skill and general cooperativeness
from the measure of non-word repetition accuracy, it almost certainly also
removed variance in capacities that are truly related to word learning. These
sources of variance likely include variance in articulation accuracy that
reflects underlying phonetic representations, variance in phonological
memory - to the extent that the real words were stored phoneme by phoneme,
and variance in memory for whole word representations. Therefore, the
partial correlation is, in all likelihood, an underestimate of the variance in
vocabulary development account for by the skills tapped by the NWR task.
These results provide strong support for the hypotheses of the present study,
that phonological memory can be measured in children younger than two
years using a non-word repetition task and that individual differences in
NWR accuracy are related to the rate at which children have built their
vocabularies, as indexed by their CDI percentile score.
STUDY 2
Given the small sample size and the small number of stimuli employed in
Study 1, replication seemed in order. The purpose of Study 2 was to provide
a replication with a different sample of children and different stimuli. In
addition, the stimuli in Study 2 were constructed so that the real words and
non-words were more exactly matched in terms of their phonological
properties than were the stimuli in Study 1. In Study 1, the non-word stimuli
were drawn from the previous literature, and the real words were selected to
match them as closely as possible in terms of phonological difficulty.
However, the real- and non-word stimuli did differ in several aspects of
phonology. The non-words contained more consonant clusters and more
complex syllable shapes than did the real words. The non-words had more
910

NONWORD REPETITION BEFORE AGE TWO

consonants in word-initial and word-final position than did the real words,
and there were more /r/ consonants and r-colored vowels in the non-words
than in the real words. In Study 2, new real words were selected, and
new non-words were generated to match the real words on a phonemeby-phoneme basis.
METHOD

Participants
Twenty-one monolingual English-learning children, 7 boys and 14 girls,
between 1 ; 8 and 2; 0 (mean age in months=22.15, SD=1.42) participated.
An additional 6 children were tested but excluded. Two were unwilling to
attempt any repetitions ; an additional 4 children repeated some real words
but were unwilling to repeat any non-words.
Procedure
The procedure for administering the real-word and non-word repetition
tasks was the same as in Study 1, with the exception that 12 words and
non-words were presented and the toddler short-form version of the CDI
(Level II, Form B) (Fenson, Pethick, Renda, Cox, Dale & Reznick, 2000)
was used to assess productive vocabulary. The procedure was conducted in
the participants' homes and was audio-recorded. For all but two of the
participants, the real-word task preceded the non-word task.
Stimuli
Twelve real words were selected from the long form of the CDI for 16- to
30-month-olds, including equal numbers of 1-syllable, 2-syllable, and
3-syllable words. Twelve non-words were created from the same segments
and word shapes as the real words. Non-words were created to have the same
consonants in syllable-initial position as real words of the same length, and as
a result onset and final consonants for each syllable of the non-word stimuli
were the same as in the real words of the same length. Real and non-words
were matched for stress pattern. Phonotactic probability of the real words
and non-words (measured as the mean biphone probability, following
Vitevitch & Luce, 2004) were not different (means=0.015 and 0.013,
respectively, F<1.0). The stimuli are listed in Appendix A.
Measures
The participants' real- and non-word repetitions were phonetically
transcribed by the third author, a graduate student in developmental
psychology, who achieved 83.2% phoneme-by-phoneme agreement with the
911

H O F F E T A L.

second author on the consonants in non-words and real words repeated by 5
of the participants. Percentage of consonants correct in real and non-words
attempted was calculated for each child. Vocabulary was measured as percentile score using short-form version CDI norms (Fenson et al., 2000); the
correlation between percentile and raw vocabulary score was r (n=21)=0.89.
The number of stimulus presentations preceding children's attempts at
repetition were also recorded.

Non-responders
The observed rate of non-compliance was sufficiently high in this study
(6 out of 27, compared to the one non-compliant child tested in Study 1) to
raise the question of whether the excluded children were systematically
different from those whose data were analyzed. Chiat & Roy (2007), in their
sample of two- to four-year-olds, found a refusal rate of 6% and no differences
between those who refused to participate and those who did. They thus
concluded that refusal reflected verbal reticence rather than inability. Noncompliance in the present study may additionally reflect the influence of the
setting - the children were tested in their homes rather than in the less
distracting and perhaps more imposing setting of the laboratory playroom
used in Study 1. Comparison of the 6 children who attempted no repetitions
of non-words to the 21 children whose data were included yielded no
significant differences in age or vocabulary, but the size and direction of
the differences suggested that sometimes refusal may reflect inability. That
is, compared to the sample of 21, the children who would not repeat
had a smaller mean raw vocabulary score (30.5 vs. 44.0) and a lower mean
vocabulary percentile (28.3 vs. 40.4). They also included proportionately
more boys : boys were 50% of the non-compliant children and 33% of the
children whose data were included. These hints from the data, along with the
higher refusal to imitate non-words compared to real words (which was also
observed by Chiat & Roy, 2007) suggest, as do our impressions from testing
the children, that in some children general reticence is the cause of refusal
to participate, but that sometimes refusal also reflects a child's awareness
that they will be unable to repeat accurately. The present data-analytic
procedure of excluding those subjects who would represent the bottom of the
distribution in repetition accuracy, if non-attempts were scored, and who do
represent the bottom end of the distribution in vocabulary development, thus
works against finding support for the hypothesis under test.

RESULTS

The mean vocabulary percentile for all children was 40.43 (SD=28.35).
Mean repetition accuracy (PCC) for real words was 63.45 (SD=15.30) and

for non-words was 57.85 (SD=12.67). This difference was statistically
significant (t (20)=2.34, p=0.015, one-tailed, gp2=0.215). The mean
number of stimulus presentations for real and non-words did not differ ; they
were 1.43 and 1.38, respectively. The inter-correlations among real word
repetition accuracy, non-word repetition accuracy and vocabulary percentile
are presented in Table 2. All correlations were significant. As in Study 1, the
partial correlation between children's non-word repetition accuracy and
their vocabulary percentile, removing the variance shared with real-word
repetition accuracy was calculated. This was statistically significant
(r (18)=0.40, p=0.04, one-tailed).1
Discussion
The participants and the stimuli in Study 2 differed from those in Study 1,
yet the essential findings of Study 1 were replicated. The participants
differed in being less advanced in vocabulary development, although they
were approximately the same age. (This is not surprising, as we cast a larger
net in recruiting participants for Study 2.) The stimuli differed in being
phonologically simpler, and thus average repetition accuracy was higher in
Study 2. Despite these differences and despite careful phonological matching
of real- and non-word stimuli, Study 2 revealed, as did Study 1, that
repetition accuracy is greater for real words than for non-words ; that
real-word repetition accuracy, NWR accuracy and vocabulary size are
significantly correlated ; and that NWR accuracy is significantly correlated
with vocabulary even partialling out the variance attributable to real-word
repetition accuracy.
[1] The data were also analyzed scoring non-attempts at repetition as zero PCC. The general
pattern of results remains the same: real words were repeated significantly more accurately
than non-words, the zero-order correlations among real-word repetition accuracy, RWR
accuracy and vocabulary percentile reached the same levels of significance. The only change in
findings was that the partial correlation between NWR accuracy and vocabulary was reduced
to r=0.34, p=0.07.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

The results of these two studies support two conclusions : (1) non-word
repetition accuracy reflects phonological memory capacity, not just
articulation skill, in children younger than two years ; and (2) at this early
point in both phonological and lexical development, phonological memory
capacity is related to the level of vocabulary development children have
achieved. Previous studies have found concurrent relations between NWR
accuracy and vocabulary in first-language acquisition from two years through
nine years and in second-language learning through adulthood (Coady
& Evans, 2008). The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to
demonstrate this relation in children younger than two years. The present
study is also the first to find a relation between NWR accuracy and
vocabulary partialling out the variance shared with real-word repetition
accuracy, and this relation proved robust across two samples and two
different stimulus sets. This finding contrasts with that of Gathercole &
Adams' (1993) study of three-year-olds, which did not find a significant
relation between NWR accuracy and receptive vocabulary when the variance
attributable to real-word repetition accuracy was removed. That study did,
however, find significant zero-order correlations among NWR, real word
repetition and vocabulary. There are several possible explanations for this
difference in findings, which will require further research : There may be
a real age-related difference in the relation of phonological memory to
vocabulary development, there may be an age-related difference in the factors
that underlie NWR performance or there may be a difference in the relation
of NWR to production vocabulary versus receptive vocabulary. Another
question for future research concerns the causal relations that underlie the
concurrent correlation between NWR and vocabulary observed in the
present studies. Previous longitudinal research with children over four years
has supported a causal path in which phonological memory skills underlie
subsequent vocabulary growth (Gathercole, 2006), but it may also be that
vocabulary growth during this early period drives changes in phonological
representations. In fact, there may be mutual and spiraling effects between
phonological and lexical development such that word learning yields more
fine-grained and robust phonological representations, which in turn support
further word learning (see Snowling, 2006 and Werker & Curtin, 2005).
In sum, the present findings make both a substantive and a methodological
contribution to the study of the relation between phonological and lexical
development. Substantively, the relation between phonological memory and
vocabulary development observed suggests that phonology and the lexicon
are related in early development. Methodologically, the present findings
establish the feasibility and validity of the non-word repetition task as a
means to assess phonological memory in young children. Thus, the findings
of the present study provide a reason and a means to ask further questions
