Abstract The growing number of multilingual speakers poses an interesting question as to
the way in which three or more languages are represented in the memory of a language user.
The Revised Hierarchical Model (Kroll and Stewart in J Mem Lang 33: 149-174, 1994) or
the Sense Model (Finkbeiner et al. in J Mem Lang 51(1), 1-22, 2004) skillfully capture the
prediction regarding two languages, with the lexical level being separate and the conceptual
one being unified or distributed to a varying degree. In this set of experiments, we employed
primed animacy decision tasks to address the lexico-semantic representation of trilingual
German-English-French speakers. The comparison of reaction times has revealed priming
effects from L1 to L2 and from L2 to L1, both with prime duration of 100 and 50 ms; a priming
asymmetry effect between the L2 and L3 language directions; and no interaction between L1
and L3. The aggregated findings point to a hybrid representation, with both compound and
coordinate representations being possible.

Introduction
According to a report entitled `Europeans and their Languages' Eurobarometer (2012) written on behalf of the European Commission about 28% of European citizens are trilingual and
11% speak more than three foreign languages. Furthermore, in a recent extensive language
questionnaire on the bilingual perception of the benefits and challenges associated with bilingualism, Tytus (2016) demonstrated that a quarter of the 92 respondents that were questioned
at a German university had knowledge of two foreign languages and an additional half of
the total spoke three languages in addition to their native German. English language was

found to be the most popular L2, French and Spanish were listed as the most popular L3s,
whereas, the L4s varied including: Chinese, Italian, and Norwegian. This growing number
of multilingual speakers poses an interesting question regarding the way in which three or
more languages are represented in the memory of a language user. So far, as pointed out by
Cenoz et al. (2001) and emphasised by De Bot (2004), many psycholinguistic models are
limited to the processing of two languages, as it is often believed that what holds for two
languages should also apply to any others. However, is this really so, should we rely on the
knowledge of the bilingual lexico-semantic representation and simply extend it by analogy
to the third or fourth language or should we propose new models based on investigations of
the trilingual lexicon. This question is addressed in the current study.

Lexico-Semantic Memory Representation
Research conducted on the organisation of bilinguals' two languages has evolved from investigation of whether these are stored separately (e.g., Kolers 1963) or are shared in memory
(e.g., De Groot and Nas 1991) to investigation of different levels of language representation, i.e. lexical and conceptual. Nowadays, evidence supporting both separate lexical stores
(one for each language) and an integrated one for L1 and L2 is available. For instance,
the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) models (Dijkstra and van Heuven 1998, 2002)
are prominent models that posit integrated levels of representation. The organization of the
conceptual store is one of the aspects that is still subject to ongoing debate. Regarding
which, Kroll and Stewart (1994) present the conceptual level in the Revised Hierarchical Model (RHM) as fully overlapping. On the other hand, Dong et al. (2005) see the
conceptual level, as illustrated in the Shared Asymmetrical Model, as both shared and distributed; whereas, Finkbeiner et al. (2004) present the conceptual level as partially shared
based on the number of shared meanings across two languages, as portrayed in the Sense
Model.
When it comes to modeling trilingual representations, De Bot (2004) offers a Multilingual Processing Model, which illustrates three stores (conceptual, syntactic and form)
with language-specific subsets that are activated by an external language node system. This
model is an adaptation of the Levelt's Speaking Model (1993) and the information about the
additional language is contained in the language node. As far as processing is concerned,
especially the issue of selective versus non-selective access, De Bot (2004) does not see the
need to develop a separate specific model for multilingual processing.
Since the memory frameworks modelling trilingual lexico-semantic memory are still
scarce (e.g. De Angelis 2007; De Bot 2004; Lijewska and Chmiel 2015), a decision was
made to draw on research from bilingual memory organisation as a basis for elaboration.
Specifically, we focus on the Revised Hierarchical Model (Kroll and Stewart 1994) and
the Sense Model (Finkbeiner et al. 2004) as potential candidates accounting for storage
of multiple languages in memory. The RHM (Fig. 1a) integrates two previous models, i.e.
the Word Association Model under which it is assumed that the meaning of L2 words is
mediated via L1 and the Concept Mediation Model which presumes a direct access of L2
words to their meanings (Potter et al. 1984). The RHM portrays L1 as larger than L2 as it
is assumed to contain more lexical information. Also, the links from L2 to L1 are stronger
than in the opposite language direction. This is related to the initial L2 learning experience
whereby more often L2 words are translated to L1 than the other way round. Furthermore,
the links between L1 and concepts and L2 and concepts are uneven, with the former being

Fig. 1 a The revised hierarchical model Kroll and Stewart (1994); L1 stands for first language, L2 stands for
second language, and C for conceptual store. b The Sense Model Finkbeiner et al. (2004); L1 stands for first
language, L2 stands for second language. Shared senses between L1 and L2 are shown in dark

stronger than the latter; however, this aspect of the model is seen as dynamic in nature.
That is, an increased level of language proficiency can strengthen the connection between
L2 and concepts and assure a more direct access to meaning (Kroll and Stewart 1994).
The model is robust and accounts for a number of findings, e.g. a translation asymmetry
(Kroll and Stewart 1994), or a priming asymmetry effect (Gollan et al. 1997). However, the
assumptions regarding the common conceptual store do not allow for storage of language
or culture specific concepts, which for instance, Pavlenko (2009) sees as a major flaw in the
model. Brysbaert and Duyck (2010) extend their criticism of the framework by questioning
the proposition regarding the separate lexicons, language selective access, or the strength
of the connections between L2 and concepts and conclude that `Is it time to leave behind
the Revised Hierarchical Model of bilingual language processing after fifteen years of service'. Nevertheless, Kroll et al. (2010), in their response to the critical review, defend the
framework by stating that, when the model was first proposed, it did not try to account for
lexical non-selectivity and that the claim regarding the weaker link between L2 and concepts has been disproved (e.g. Dufour and Kroll 1995). Kroll and colleagues concede that
the RHM requires a number of revisions due to the new research findings available. However, the model is still considered to be robust and able to account for new findings in the
field.
The Sense Model (Fig. 1b), put forward by Finkbeiner et al. (2004), resembles the RHM,
in that it also illustrates the lexical form representation as separate between L1 and L2. The
lexical semantic representation is presented however as having a certain degree of distribution, i.e. some senses/meanings are seen as shared between L1 and L2, whereas some
other as language specific. The model was tested by means of employing a masked priming paradigm with polysemous Japanese-English words as stimuli. Such design allowed
addressing the priming asymmetry effect. That is, the researchers believed that the priming
effect is unequal as the number of activated senses differs for each processing direction,
i.e. the activation from L1 to L2 is greater (many-to-few-sense) than the activation from
L2 to L1 (few-to-many-sense). The researchers explained that "this is because it is frequently the case that there are many senses associated with the L1 form that are not similarly
associated with the L2 prime" (Finkbeiner et al. 2004: 9). Therefore, significant facilitation is consistently observed in the L1 to L2 direction but less frequently so in the opposite
way.
The predictions regarding the conceptual level of representation, namely its sharedness
or distribution in a multilingual lexicon, will be tested in the current set of experiments.

Multilingual Lexicon
The lexico-semantic memory of trilingual speakers has been explored before in a limited number of investigations that varied greatly with regard to the language combinations, levels of
participants' language knowledge, and types of tasks implemented. For instance, Abunuwara
(1992) requested Arabic-Hebrew-English speakers to take part in a trilingual Stroop task
(Experiment 1) and in a word-picture naming one (Experiment 2). All participants spoke
Arabic as their L1 but the L2s and L3s differed. That is, for 7 participants their proficiency
was L1 > L2 > L3, and for the remaining 3 it was L1 > L3 > L2 in Experiment 1 and for 17
speakers it followed the pattern of L1 > L2 > L3 and for 13 remaining speakers it was L1 >
L3 > L2 in Experiment 2. In the Stroop task, large interference effects between L1 and L2 as
well as L1 and L3 were observed, whereas a small interference effect was noted between L2
and L3. The results from the word-picture naming task pointed to a complex patter. In sum,
the results of the two tasks pointed to a hybrid representation of the three languages, e.g.
a coordinate relationship (separate) was observed between Hebrew and English, whereas a
compound one (shared as portrayed by the RHM) was found between Hebrew and Arabic
and English and Arabic. This pattern of results was attributed to the different levels of language proficiency and the fact that L1 was the first acquired language. Moreover, Abunuwara
postulated adhering to the developmental perspective, i.e. treating all three verbal systems as
dynamic in nature, whereby shifting levels of proficiency can lead to a change in the relative
strength of connections and a potential qualitative change from a coordinate to a compound
verbal system. Furthermore, De Groot and Hoeks (1995), in a study with trilingual Dutch-
English-French speakers (L1 > L2 > L3), also provided evidence for a developmental shift
(no information about the AOAs was given). The researchers manipulated the word concreteness in a translation production task and a translation recognition task from L1 (Dutch)
to either L2 (English) or L3 (French). The researchers demonstrated that a concreteness
effect was observable during the Dutch-English (L1 to L2) translation but not during Dutch-
French (L1 to L3) one. That means that the Concept Mediation Model (Potter et al. 1984) best
accounted for the results for the L1 to L2 translation, whereas the Word Association Model
(Potter et al. 1984) better explained the L1 to L3 translation outcomes. In contrast, Francis
and Gallard (2005) elicited translation responses in six language directions from a group
of English-Spanish-French trilinguals in a delayed repetition priming task. The AOA for
English was equal to 6.7 years of age, for Spanish it was 5.6 and for French it was 13.3. The
levels of language proficiency among the participants were also varied, i.e. 42 participants
were more proficient in L1 than L3, 33 had a higher level of proficiency in L2 than L3 and 27
reported higher proficiency in L1 than L2. The researchers demonstrated that translation in
all language directions involved conceptual access. Finally, in a study conducted by Aparicio
and Lavaur (2015), which is most relevant to the current investigations since it relied on a
masked translation priming methodology, a group of French-English-Spanish speakers was
requested to perform a primed lexical decision task. All the participants acquired French
from birth, English at the mean age of 10 and Spanish on average at 13 years of age. The
proficiency pattern for all of the participants was the same and followed L1 > L2 = L3. The
researchers demonstrated a translation priming effect only when the primes belonged to the
dominant language. Moreover, no translation priming was observed for L2 and L3 primes.
This set of results points to a multilingual lexicon organised by the L1, with no cross-language
interactions between L2 and L3.
The emerging picture of the multilingual lexico-semantic representation appears to be
rather complex, with both compound and coordinate representations possible. Also, language

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:1625-1644

1629

proficiency seems to act as an important factor in determining the type of the representation
available. Consequently, in the current set of experiments, a very similar set of questions to
Aparicio and Lavaur (2015) is addressed; however, some important modifications were introduced. To start with, a different combination of languages, i.e. German-English-French is
explored. Also, our participants appeared to be fairly balanced in their knowledge of German
and English, whereas their knowledge and use of French was relatively weaker. In addition,
the priming task that was employed had a form of a primed animacy decision task, in order
to ensure access to the conceptual information, and it was run in all six language directions.
However, before the motivation for the current set of studies is presented, a quick review of
bilingual priming is necessary in order to understand the derivation of the hypotheses.

Priming in Bilingual Populations
Priming is a very informative experimental paradigm. It has been extensively used both with
monolingual and bilingual populations to examine lexico-semantic memory. It relies on the
process of spreading activation, i.e. a mechanism that activates not only the meaning of a
given word, but also the meanings of other semantically or associatively related words, e.g.
bread-butter, or a translation equivalent in a cross-linguistic design, e.g. bread -Brot. The
task most commonly takes two forms, masked or unmasked. Under the masked condition
primes are presented for a very short period of time (e.g. 40 to 50 ms) and are hidden in
between a forward and backward mask (obscure signs in the form of dollar signs or hash
tags) in order to ensure that subliminal priming can be observed (Forster and Davis 1984). In
a bilingual version of the masked task, the participants are presented with primes in, e.g. L1
and targets in L2; however, they are not supposed to be aware of the bilingual nature of the
task; the primes are meant to be processed without the participants' conscious awareness.
Both semantic and translation priming across languages have shown a lot of variation. That
is, the priming effect has been consistently reported from L1 to L2, but not in the opposite
language direction (e.g., Keatley et al. 1994). This pattern of results was also observed in an
auditory modality in a priming task with Chinese-English bilinguals (Tytus and Rundblad
2016). More recent investigations have also observed priming from L2 to L1, but this is less
consistent and weaker when compared to that obtained in the L1-L2 direction (e.g. Dunabeitia
et al. 2010 or Schoonbaert et al. 2009). Wang (2013) attributed the priming asymmetry to
a relative imbalance of two languages, whereas Duyck and Warlop (2009) put this down to
the L1 dominant environment that participants often live in. Altarriba and Basnight-Brown
(2007), on the other hand, conducted an extensive review of priming studies and concluded
that the variation in priming might be related to the variation in methodology, e.g. varied
duration of the prime, relatedness proportion (RP), large number of nonwords in a lexical
decision task, or a varied stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). The authors advised that in order
to ensure measuring automatic language processing and at the same time to eliminate the
more strategic processes of translation, expectation and verification (Neely et al. 1989), the
RP has to be kept below 0.5 and the SOA should ideally be around 200 ms or shorter.
The explanation of the priming asymmetry has also been attributed to the use of polysemous stimuli (Finkbeiner et al. 2004) and the fact that L2 primes might be processed slower
and therefore, with a short SOA they may not activate enough information that then spreads
to other items. Jiang (1999) tested the processing accounts by introducing several experimental modifications, e.g. a 50 ms blank interval or a 150 ms backward mask, and has not
found a support for those accounts. Consequently, he preferred the representational account

123

1630

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:1625-1644

that directly relates to the propositions of the RHM and the uneven strength of connections
between L1 and concepts and L2 and concepts. In short, L1 is believed to activate more
conceptual information, which then spreads to other items. This account will be tested in the
current investigation.

Present Study
The major aim of this study is to extend the discussion of the lexico-semantic memory
organisation to trilingual speakers by administering the priming paradigm in the form of
an animacy decision task. Based on previous findings, mostly from the bilingual memory
research, the main hypotheses are: (1) related items across all language conditions should
be responded to quicker and more correctly than the unrelated ones; in other words, if the
items are shared in memory between the three languages we should observe a cross linguistic
priming effect. (2) Language pair direction should lead to a difference in response time,
with responses provided in German being the fastest and those in French the slowest. (3)
Translation priming effects should be observed from the more dominant languages to less
dominant ones, i.e. L1-L2, L1-L3, L2-L3, but not in the opposite language direction, i.e.
L2-L1, L3-L1, L3-L2, in line with the representational account for the priming asymmetry.
Secondary hypotheses of the study are: (4) language proficiency may cancel out the priming
asymmetry and finally (5) prime duration 100 ms (Experiment 1) vs. 50 ms (Experiment 2)
should not lead to a differing pattern of result. The first four hypotheses will be addressed in
each experiment separately before being compared across the two experiments.

Experiment 1-Method
Participants
Twenty-three participants took part in the experiment between the ages of 20 and 28 (M =
21.8, S D = 2.7), six of whom were male and 17 female. All were university students and
were enrolled on Bachelor and master's programmes of study. Furthermore, all participants
were born in Germany, spoke German as their native language, and had advanced knowledge
of English and intermediate knowledge of French. The AoA of English was equal to 9.42
(S D = 2.22) and the AoA of French was 12.38 (S D = 2.58), t Ao A (22) = -4.146, p < .001.
Both foreign languages were acquired mostly at school. Twenty-two participants indicated
having a dominant language; for all of them it was German. When questioned about the
context in which each of the languages was used, German was the language used in most
domains (i.e., family, friends, university and work), English was reserved for communication
with friends and at university (university courses at the tertiary institution, where the data
collection took place, are offered both in German and English); whilst French was used
less frequently and mostly when communicating with friends. This was also reflected in
the answers to the frequency of language use on a scale from 1 = never to 7 = always:
German = 6.92, English = 5.33, and French = 2.38, F f r eq (1, 22) = 124.59, p < .001.
The level of language proficiency was evaluated with a subjective self-assessment of the five
major language skills, F pr o f (1, 22) = 71.17, p < .001 (Table 1) and an objective measure
of multiple choice English and French language tests. The average score on the English test
was equal to 22 points (S D = 2.9) out of 25. In French, the score was a bit lower, i.e.

Materials
Translation Priming Task
Many of the prime-target pairs of words were selected from a study on the Chinese-English
mental lexicon by Tytus and Rundblad (2016). However, since the number of stimuli needed
for the current investigation was much greater due to six language directions, we initially
compiled a list of 540 items in English. We selected the items from the following categories:
living entities--animals, relatives, professions, and creatures; non-living things--buildings,
musical instruments, items of clothing, pieces of furniture, and stationary equipment. The
choice of stimuli was motivated by the fact that an animacy decision task had been selected
(Is this living entity or a non-living thing?) rather than a lexical decision one in order to
ensure access and retrieval of semantic information.
The next stage of stimuli preparation involved translating and verifying the translations in
all three languages of interest. This was performed by three speakers of German who were
also proficient in English and French. Next, only those words that were shorter than 13 letters
were retained. The German words were on average 5.9 letters long, the English ones 6.3 and
the French ones were 6.6. The length difference was observed to be statistically significant,
Flength (2, 429) = 3.650, p = .027. A post hoc Tukey test showed that only the L1 and the L3
word length differed significantly, p = .020. The frequency of occurrence of each item (per
million) was checked with the use of WordGen software (Duyck and Warlop, 2004). It took the
following values: German-44.110, English-38.093, French-36.808, F f r eq (2, 392) = .448,
p = .614. Furthermore, since the frequency information was not available in WordGen for
all of the chosen words, we also employed a more subjective measure of stimuli evaluation
and requested a group of 15 students, who were native speakers of German and were highly
proficient in English, to evaluate their familiarity with the words in German and English on
a 7 point scale (with 1 equal to not familiar at all and 7 being very familiar). All items that
were rated below the mean of 6.80 (S D = 0.38) were removed. Some of those words in
English were: necktie, apron, cradle, bagpipe, ribbon, chandelier, chimes, boar, rhino, and
vulture. No German words were removed.
The cognate words were looked at and compared separately. The mean length of the
words was equal to: German--5.5, English--5.9, French--6.5, Flength (2, 213) = 5.995,
p = .003. A multiple comparisons Tukey HSD test showed that the statistically significant
difference was found between L1 and L3 words. The reported mean frequency of cognate

123

1632

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:1625-1644

words between the three languages did not differ. That is, it was equal to 28.036 in German,
29.158 in English and 19.263 in French, F f r eq (2, 186) = 1.353, p = .261.
In the next preparatory stage, the words were divided into six language groups: L2-L1,
L3-L1; L1-L2, L3-L2; L1-L3, L2-L3, resulting in three major language blocks, for which we
varied the presentation language of the prime, but kept the language of the target constant,
either German, English, or French. The items were counterbalanced across the blocks. The
three target-language blocks were presented in the same order for all participants. Each
language group included 24 translation equivalents that were related (12 animate and 12
inanimate), e.g. surgeon--Chirurg (surgeon) or belt--Gurtel (belt), and 24 word pairs that
were not related to one another (also 12 animate and 12 inanimate), e.g. bird--Neffe (nephew)
or window--Brucke (bridge). In addition, 24 cognate pairs of words (12 animate and 12
inanimate), e.g. mother--Mutter (mother) or shoe--Schuh (shoe) were part of each language
group. On the whole, the cognate pairs were double cognates and did not have a complete
form overlap, but in 25 pairs out of 144 this was not achieved. Examples such as: panda-
Panda, bus-Bus, zebra-Zebra were also included. The cognate words served as fillers. In
sum, each language group contained 48 critical items and 24 fillers, thus each language
block had 72 items. The participants had to respond to a total of 432 word pairs in the whole
experiment ( "Appendix 1" ). The relatedness proportion of the entire stimuli list was 67% (24
related non-cognate translations, 24 unrelated non-cognate pairs, 24 cognate fillers), which
is slightly higher than the recommended 50%.
We followed a design utilised in a study conducted with bilingual Chinese-English speakers by Tytus and Rundblad (2016). Each experimental trial started with a presentation of 10
hash marks (##########) that served as a fixation point and a forward mask, which remained
on the screen for 500 ms. Next, the prime was shown for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen
for 50 ms, and a backward mask in the form of 10 italicised dollar signs ($$$$$$$$$$) for
another 150 ms. This resulted in a SOA of 300 ms. The target remained on the screen until
the participants provided the answer, but no longer than 2500 ms. No feedback on the accuracy of the answers was offered. A single prime-target sequence is presented in Fig. 2. The
participants had to press as quickly and accurately as possible the Enter key, if the word
represented a living entity and Tab key if the word was an example of a non-living thing.
The experiment was designed with the use of Eprime 2 software (Schneider et al. 2002). All
words were displayed in black uppercase letters, in order to mask the German nouns, which
commonly start with a capital letter, on a white background.

Language Background Questionnaire
The questionnaire ("Appendix 2") was designed on a LimeSurvey platform. It comprised
three parts, i.e. a biographical part, an English language test, and a French language test.
The first part was administered in German and focused on collecting demographics as well
as linguistic information about the three languages including the age at which the languages
were taken up, context of language acquisition and context of language use, frequency and
confidence of language use, and a subjective evaluation of their proficiency level, including:
reading, writing, speaking, listening and the use of grammar. This was followed by a multiple choice test of English language skills, which was developed based on online materials
from the Cambridge English Language Assessment (http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/testyour-english/adult-learners/). Finally, the participants provided answers to a multiple choice
French test, which included 20 questions. The test was based on an online quiz that follows
the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (http://www.france-langue.
com/online-french-test.html).

Procedure
The experiment took place on the university premises, in the psycholinguistic lab. The participants were recruited via emails and social network groups at the university. Each person
was tested separately. After being given a brief introduction, the participants first attended
to the priming task, which was followed by their filling in the online questionnaire. It took
on average 40 minutes for the participants to complete the tasks and each person received 5
Euro for taking part in the experiment.

Results
The repeated measures analyses of variance performed on the reaction times (RTs) and error
percentage rates (ERs) were based on the subjects (F1 ) and items (F2 ) and followed a 2
(prime relatedness: related and unrelated) x 6 (language pair: L3-L1, L2-L1, L1-L2, L3L2, L1-L3, L2-L3) factorial design. Incorrect responses (7.1%) and reaction times that were
below or above the mean  2 SD (4.7%) as well as the cognate items that served as fillers
were excluded from the analysis. The mean RTs and error rates are presented in Table 2
below.
The ANOVA on response latency demonstrated that words that were preceded by related
primes (827 ms) were recognised quicker by approximately 40 ms than words proceeded by
unrelated ones (867 ms), F1 (1, 22) = 20.814, p < .001, and F2 (1, 143) = 19.358, p <
.001. The main effect of the language pair also showed a statistically significant result, both in
the subjects and items analyses, F1 (5, 110) = 11.524, p < .001 and F2 (5, 115) = 14.259,
p < .001. The shortest response times were recorded for those provided in German: L3-L1 =
809ms, L2-L1 = 812ms. This was followed by the mean RT values in English: L1-L2 =
820ms, L3-L2 = 850ms and next, those given in response to French stimuli: L1-L3 = 889ms,
L2-L3 = 923ms. Furthermore, a statistically significant two-way interaction between prime
relatedness and language pair was demonstrated in the subjects analysis, F1 (5, 110) = 4.902,

p = .004 and F2 (5, 115) = 1.538, p = .311. The exploration of the interaction effect (Fig. 3,
right) was followed by a series of paired samples t-test analyses (with Bonferroni correction
applied, which resulted in a significance level of p = .05/6 (six language conditions),
therefore p = .0083), which showed three statistically significant comparisons, i.e. that
between related and unrelated items in L2-L1 language pair, t (22) = -3.532, p = .002; in
the L1-L2 language pair, t (22) = -3.837, p = .001; and in the L3-L2 one, t (22) = -5.257,
p < .001. In each of the mentioned language pairs, the related targets were recognised faster
than the unrelated ones, resulting in priming effects of: L2-L1 - 58 ms, L1-L2 - 65 ms, and
L3-L2 - 72 ms. In the remaining three language pairs, the comparison based on priming
relatedness did not result in statistically significant results: in L3-L1, t (22) = -0.808,
p = .428; in L1-L3, t (22) = -1.486, p = .152; and in L2-L3, t (22) = 1.049, p = .306.
The same pattern of results has been shown in the item analysis.
The ANOVAs conducted on the percentage of errors revealed that neither the prime relatedness, nor the language pair reached statistical significance, F1 (1, 22) = 1, 211, p = .283 and
F2 (1, 22) = 0.674, p = .421 and F1 (5, 110) = 1.063, p = .385 and F2 (5, 110) = 4.635,
p = .001 (a significant effect was only observed in the item analysis). Furthermore, the interaction between the relatedness and language pair turned out not to be statistically significant,
F1 (5, 110) = 1.775, p = .417 and F2 (5, 110) = 0.616, p = .688. The seemingly higher

123

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:1625-1644

1635

percentage of errors in the French target language conditions might be illustrative of the fact
that this language was the weakest one in our speakers' language repertoire.
All in all, a priming effect has been demonstrated across the three investigated languages.
More detailed analysis has pointed, however, to priming between L1-L2 and L2-L1 direction
and a priming asymmetry effect between L2-L3 and L3-L2. Nevertheless, the prime duration
of 100 ms and resulting SOA of 300 ms might undermine the obtained results as at 100 ms
primes might have been visible to the participants and the respondents might have relied on
strategic language processing rather than automatic one. Therefore, a decision was made to
keep everything constant and replicate the experiment with reduced prime presentation of
50 ms (250 ms SOA).

Experiment 2-Method
Participants
Twenty-one participants (16 female) completed the priming task. The participants were university students; on average, 22.6 years old (S D = 2.5); born in Germany and spoke German
as their mother tongue. All participants spoke English fluently and had an intermediate knowledge of French. The mean age of English language acquisition was equal to 9.3 years of age
(S D = 2.6), whereas the AoA for French was 11.6 (S D = 3.7). The acquisition of both languages took place mostly at school. All the participants indicated having a dominant language,
which for most of them was German. Furthermore, the German language was reported as
being used most frequently 6.9 (on a scale from 1 = never to 7 = always) and in a wide range
of contexts, i.e. family, friends, university and at work. English was used most frequently
at the university and during communication with friends, with the mean frequency being
equal to 5.7. French received a mean frequency score of 2.1, with some of the participants
identifying this as the language of communication with friends. This difference in frequency
of use was statistically significant, F f r eq (1, 20) = 174.33, p < .001. The mean self-rated
proficiency values for the three languages are given in Table 3; F pr o f (1, 20) = 114.03,
p < .001. The objective evaluation, in a form of a language test, of the participants' English
and French skills displays similar results. On an English multiple choice test, out of 25 points,
the students scored a mean of 23 points (S D = 2.5), whereas on a French one, out of 20
points, they achieved, on average, 15 (S D = 2.3). Moreover, when the participants were
questioned about the level of confidence with which they use each language (on a scale from
1 = low to 7 = high), they gave the following ratings: German = 6.9 (S D = 04),
English = 6.4 (S D = 0.6) and French = 2.8 (S D = 1.2); Fcon f (1, 20) = 169.29,
p < .001.

Materials and Procedure
The tasks and procedure utilised in this experiment replicates exactly that used in Experiment
1. The major difference is related to the reduction of prime duration from 100 to 50 ms so as
to ensure a subliminal processing of the prime.

Results
To start with, the latency data were prepared for the analysis, i.e. the erroneous responses
(8.9%) and reaction times (RTs) that were 2SD below or above the mean (5%) were excluded.
Next, a repeated measures ANOVA on the RTs and the error rates (ERs) was conducted, a
within-subjects 2 (prime relatedness: related vs. unrelated) x 6 (language pair: L3-L1, L2-L1,
L1-L2, L3-L2, L1-L3 and L2-L3) factorial design was followed.
It was demonstrated that related items were recognised at a mean value of 802 ms,
whereas those ones that were preceded by an unrelated word were responded to at a mean
of 820 ms. The difference of 18 ms was statistically significant in both subject and item analyses, F1 (1, 20) = 9.999, p = .005 and F2 (1, 138) = 4.024, p = .047. Furthermore, the
comparison involving language pairs also turned out to be statistically significant in both
subject and item analyses, F1 (5, 100) = 24.098, p < .001 and F2 (5, 138) = 15.690,
p < .001. The responses to the individual language pairs were equal to: L3-L1 = 779ms,
L2-L1 = 772ms, L1-L2 = 779ms, L3-L2 = 784ms, L1-L3 = 867ms and L2-L3 = 883ms.
Overall, the participants were fastest when responding in German and this was followed
by the responses given in English, with those in French being the slowest. Finally, a
statistically significant interaction between the prime relatedness and language pair was
noted, F1 (5, 100) = 8.995, p < .001 and F2 (5, 138) = 2.493, p = .034. A series of
paired sample t-tests (with Bonferroni correction applied with p value set at .0083) has
demonstrated statistically significant differences between three language pairs, i.e. L1-L2,
L2-L1 and L2-L3 (Table 4). A priming effect of 41 ms was demonstrated for targets in L2L1, t (20) = -3.028, p = .007. A facilitative effect of 66 ms for the related items was
observed from L1 to L2, t (20) = -6.908, p < .001. Finally, when L2-L3 language direction was considered, it turned out to be significant, t (20) = 3.189, p = .005; however, an
inhibitory effect of 37 ms was observed. The remaining three language directions (L3-L1,
L1-L3 and L3-L2) were not statistically significant. An effect of 30 ms in the L3-L1 condition
was not significant, t (20) = -2.493, p = .022. No statistically significant difference was
observed between the related and unrelated items in the L1-L3 condition, t (20) = 1.035,
p = .313. Lastly, the difference of 25 ms in the L3 to L2 condition was not significant,
t (20) = -2.547, p = .019. The same pattern of results has been demonstrated in the item
analysis.
In sum, the results point to symmetrical priming effects between German and English in
both language directions. Furthermore, priming asymmetry was observed between English
and French, i.e. no priming was visible from the weaker language (French) to the stronger
ones (English) but an inhibitory effect was present in the opposite language direction from
English to French.
The repeated measures ANOVA conducted on the error rates has revealed a statistically
significant effect of a language pair both in the subject and item analyses, F1 (5, 100) =
19.774, p < .001 and F2 (5, 138) = 5.180, p < .001. The least number of mistakes was made
by the participants when responding in German, followed by the responses given in English

and finally, those in French. The priming relatedness, however, has not resulted in a significant
difference, F1 (1, 20) = 2.107, p = .125 and F2 (1, 138) = .412, p = .522. Nevertheless, a
significant interaction between the language pair and the prime relatedness has been observed
in the subject analysis, F1 (5, 100) = 7.199, p < .001 and F2 (5, 138) = 1.287, p = .273.
Overall, the participants made the smallest number of mistakes when responding to the
related items in German (L3-L1 = 2.7% and L2-L1 = 3.6%) (Table 4). In English, there is
seemingly no difference between the related and unrelated number of errors (6.5%). Finally,
the responses in French appear to have been most problematic, whereby for the related items
from L1-L3 the participants responded incorrectly in 18% of the cases, and did so for the
L2-L3 related items 23.8% of the time. This finding also aligns with the analysis of the
latency data.
The results from this study resemble to a large extent those from the first experiment.
That is, priming effects and priming asymmetry effects, including inhibition appear to be
similar. Nevertheless, to verify the impact of the prime duration (100 vs. 50 ms), the current set of data was compared directly to that from Experiment 1. It was demonstrated
that there was no statistically significant interaction between the prime relatedness and
the experiment (Experiment 1 = 100 ms and Experiment2 = 50 ms), F1 (1, 42) = 3.558,
p = .065. Also, the interaction between language pair and the experiment did not result in a
statistically significant result, F1 (1, 42) = .000, p = .994. Finally, the three way interaction
between prime relatedness, language pair and the experiment was not statistically significant,
F1 (1, 42) = 1.822, p = .184. The mean RTs from both experiments are visually compared
in Fig. 3 above.
To conclude, at 50 ms prime presentation priming effects were observed from L1 to L2
and vice versa. No interaction was observed between French (L3) and German (L1) and a
form of asymmetry occurred between French and English (no facilitation from L3 to L2
but an inhibition from L2 to L3). Furthermore, the comparison of the effects with primes
displayed at 50 ms and those shown for 100 ms did not result in a statistically significant
difference. The speed of participants' responses was similar across the two experiments and
no interaction between the prime relatedness, the language pair, and the experiment was
observed. The interpretation and the implications of these results will be discussed in the
forthcoming section.

Discussion
In the current study, the representation of trilingual German-English-French lexical memory
was investigated with the use of a primed animacy decision task. It was predicted that the

123

1638

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:1625-1644

related items should be recognised quicker that the unrelated ones and that German targets
should be responded to quicker than those in English or French. Furthermore, the priming
effect was expected to appear only from the dominant language directions, thus resulting in
priming asymmetry effects. It was also hypothesised that language proficiency may cancel
the priming asymmetry effect out. Finally, no difference between the prime duration of 100
and 50 ms was expected.
It has been demonstrated that, overall, the related items were recognised faster than the
unrelated ones, but no effect of item accuracy was observed. The latency data, however,
allows retaining the first hypothesis, which predicted that a cross-linguistic priming effect
will be observed if the items are shared in memory between the three languages. Furthermore, the language pairs contributed to a difference in reaction times, with responses getting
substantially slower from German to English to French. This finding allows accepting the
second hypothesis. Next, to address the third hypothesis the interaction effects were explored
in more detail. It became clear that the priming effects were evident between the following
language pairs: L2-L1, L1-L2, and L3-L2 in Experiment 1 and L2-L1, L1-L2, and L2-L3, and
in Experiment 2. Consistent priming effects occurred between German and English in both
directions (L1-L2 and L2-L1). The magnitude of the effects slightly differed but was present
in both language pairs. On the other hand, a priming asymmetry effect was observed between
L3-L2 and L2-L3 in Experiment 1. Also, a form of the asymmetry between those language
pairs was present in Experiment 2; however, in the L2-L3 language direction, the unrelated
items were responded to faster, which led to an inhibitory effect. This is an unexpected pattern
of results that cannot be easily explained. Certainly, it is not related to language dominance. It
can be hypothesised that the difference might be related to a differing activation of L2 versus
L3 primes and the speed of responses given to L3 versus L2 targets. Finally, no priming was
reported between the L1-L3 and L3-L1 language pairs in both experiments. All in all, the
combined results allow retaining the first two experimental predictions regarding the overall
priming effects and faster responses in German compared to the other two languages. The
third hypothesis can be partially retained as the priming asymmetry was observed but only
between two language pairs.
Furthermore, it seems that the high level of participants' language proficiency in German
and English (as reported by the participants themselves, as seen from the English proficiency
test, faster RTs and lower percentage of errors in the psycholinguistic tasks) contributed to
cancelling out the priming asymmetry effect between L1-L2 and L2-L1. The magnitude of
the effect from L1 to L2 appeared to be slightly stronger (65 ms in Exp. 1 and 66 ms in
Exp. 2) than that in the opposite language direction (58 ms in Exp. 1 and 41 ms in Exp. 2),
but it was still present in both language directions. Finally, when the aggregated results were
compared between the two experiments, no statistically significant differences were observed
between two prime duration conditions which allows retaining the final hypothesis of this
study.
Overall, the results obtained in this set of experiments do not fully substantiate the Revised
Hierarchical Model (Kroll and Stewart 1994). The priming results do not point to a fully overlapping representation between the three languages, as assumed under the RHM. They point
to a `hybrid' representation, with an almost fully shared representation between L1 and L2,
partially shared representation between L2 and L3, and little interaction between L1 and L3.
Hence, the Sense Model with the proposition of a distributed lexical semantic representation appears to be more suited to capture the trilingual lexical memory. Furthermore, based
on the reported priming asymmetries it seems reasonable to conclude that the strength of
connections between the languages differs. Those between the lexicons of L1 and L2 and
concepts appear to be almost equal in strength; therefore, consistent priming effects can be

Fig. 4 The modified trilingual lexical memory model

observed in both language directions. This pattern of results has also been demonstrated in
several recent bilingual lexical memory studies and it has been attributed to, e.g. successive
language learning (Dunabeitia et al. 2010), L2 dominant environment (Duyck and Warlop
2009), or relative bilingual balance between two languages (Wang 2013). The connections
between L2 and L3 and concepts and between L1 and L3 and concepts most likely vary, with
L1 and L2 connections being stronger than those between L3 and concepts. It is possible that
the L3 access to meaning is mediated via L2 or L1, especially given the fact that we worked
with a group of German-English-French speakers who learnt French through the means of
German language instruction.
On the basis of the above findings, we could model a trilingual lexico-semantic memory that is largely based on the Sense Model, however one that extends to three languages
and varies slightly with regard to the architecture at the conceptual level (Fig. 4). In this
framework, the size of the respective lexicons is considered to be smaller for L2 and
L3, reflecting the levels of language proficiency. The connections between the L3 and
L2 lexical stores are seen as asymmetrical and are comparable to the ones between L2
and L1. This is meant to be reflective of the translation asymmetry effect reported in earlier bilingual studies (e.g., Kroll and Stewart 1994); however, this set of predictions has
not been tested in the current investigation. The mean translation response times, obtained
in a study of English-Spanish-French trilingual speakers by Francis and Gallard (2005),
partially confirm the assumption of differing strength of connections between the three
languages.
The conceptual level of representation, as depicted in the model, is seen as mostly shared
between the L1 and L2, somehow shared between L2 and L3 and L1 and L3. The compound
representations are seen as largely overlapping but not fully unified. This is supposed to reflect
on the fact that in the current set of experiments only concrete nouns served as stimuli. If
other parts of speech were to be investigated, abstract nouns, or words with language/culture
specific meaning more distribution at this level of representation would be expected. Also,
similarly to the RHM and the Sense Model, this framework is seen as dynamic in nature.
That is, it is assumed the compound-coordinate representations can vary reflecting different
levels of language proficiency, AOAs, and mode of acquisition. The Modified Trilingual

123

1640

J Psycholinguist Res (2017) 46:1625-1644

Lexical Memory model can also account for findings obtained in previous investigations.
The results presented by Abunuwara (1992) pointed to both a coordinate and a compound
representation between Arabic, Hebrew and English. De Groot and Hoeks (1995) showed that
the Concept Mediation Model (Potter et al. 1984) best illustrates the representation between
L1 and L2, whereas the Word Association Model (Potter et al. 1984) does so between L1
to L3 of Dutch-English-French speakers. Nevertheless, language proficiency appears to
play an important role in the differing patterns observed. Therefore, the trilingual lexicon
should be explored further in order to try to account for the dynamic nature of linguistic
representations. My immediate efforts will focus on running a translation recognition task in
six language direction in order to verify the strength of the interlexical connections between
the languages and on establishing the strength of connections between the lexical form
representation and the lexical semantic representation with a help of word picture recognition
task.
Before the concluding remarks are presented, several limitations of the current set of
experiments have to be recognised. Since the animacy decision task required retrieving the
information about the animacy of the words in order to reach a decision, we did not control
for the orthographic overlap between the pairs of words. It is likely however that given
the historical influence of French on English more orthographic overlap is seen between
words in those languages than between French and German ones, which could have led
to the directional priming effects. Also, the difference in the length of the German and
French words might have contributed to less interaction between the two systems. Finally,
the unusual pattern of priming from the L3 to L2 has to be explored further, especially
the influence of the speed of processing of primes and targets in languages of differing
proficiency. Zhao and Li (2013) have simulated semantic and translation priming with the
help of a self-organizing neural network model, DevLex-II. Interestingly, the researchers
have identified several factors that modulate priming effects, e.g. the distance between words
in the two languages in the semantic space, levels of activation of the prime words, and the
degree of target recognition. The levels of activation and the degree of recognition might be
related to language proficiency and language automaticity, therefore those elements should
be investigated further.

Conclusions
Many speakers around the globe exert knowledge of more than two foreign languages. This
poses an interesting question for researchers since it is not clear whether we should rely on
our knowledge of the bilingual lexico-semantic representations and extend those by analogy
to the third language or should we propose new psycholinguistic models. In this set of
experiments, we have demonstrated that existing models, e.g. the Sense Model (Finkbeiner
et al. 2004) with slight modifications, can account for the lexico-semantic representation
of trilingual speakers. However, the dynamic interaction between three linguistic systems
and shifting patterns of representation that might be related to language proficiency, active
language use, authentic language exposure, and frequency of language use should be explored
further.
