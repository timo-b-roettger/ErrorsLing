Articulatory kinematics were analyzed to determine if adults who stutter are
generally poorer at speech movement pattern generation and if changing speech
rate affects their stability in the same way that it affects normally fluent controls.
Adults who stutter (n = 14) and a matched group of controls produced fluent
repetitions of a simple phrase at normal, slow, and fast rates. A composite index
of spatiotemporal stability (STI), as well as independent measures of timing and
spatial variability, revealed that adults who stutter can operate within normal
movement parameter ranges under low-demand speaking conditions. However,
some of the stuttering participants showed evidence of abnormal instability even
when repeating a simple utterance at habitual rate. Also, measures of relative
timing indicated that adults who stutter, unlike their matched controls, are not
better timers at habitual vs. nonpreferred speech rates. Overall, the results suggest
that the kinematic characteristics of the fluent speech of adults who stutter
generally overlap that of normally fluent speakers; however, subtle differences in
kinematic parameters are interpreted to reveal their susceptibility to speech motor
breakdown when performance demands increase.

linical and theoretical issues motivate this investigation of articulatory kinematics associated with habitual, slow, and fast
speaking rates in two relatively large (n = 14) groups of adult
speakers, one normally fluent and one diagnosed as stuttering. Many
therapeutic strategies for ameliorating stuttering produce a reduction
in speaking rate either as a direct or indirect target (Bloodstein, 1987;
Onslow & Ingham, 1987; St. Louis & Westbrook, 1987). Despite the longstanding and widespread clinical impression that reduced speaking rates
enhance fluency, the mechanisms for this fluency enhancement are unclear. In children it is often posited that slowed speaking rates allow
more time for language formulation and reduce communicative pressure (e.g., Wall & Myers, 1995). A series of recent studies, however, has
failed to establish any systematic link between speaking rate and fluency in young children (reviewed by Yaruss, 1997).
Regarding adults who stutter, the landmark papers of Zimmermann
(1980a, 1980b, 1980c) have led many authors to propose that improvements in fluency achieved at slow speaking rates derive from the physiological benefit of operating in a reduced articulatory range. Zimmermann (1980b) reported that, compared to normally fluent adults, the
perceptually fluent speech of adults who stutter was characterized by

reduced amplitudes and velocities of articulatory movement and by longer intervals between articulatory
events. He postulated that speech production processes
normally operate within certain ranges of variability of
movement parameters and timing. If these ranges are
exceeded, he suggested, the normal balance in sensorimotor pathways, especially reflex loops, might be
lost, and unstable behavior leading to fluency breakdown
might occur. In other words, Zimmermann suggested
that the optimal speech motor performance range for
adults who stutter is different than that of normally fluent adults. For individuals who stutter, reduced articulator displacements and velocities associated with lower
variability and longer intervals between articulatory
events would decrease the probability of the motor breakdowns characteristic of disfluent speech (Zimmermann,
1980a, 1980b, 1980c).
This hypothesis was further explored by Zimmermann
and Hanley (1983). They examined the effects of a fluency enhancing procedure, the adaptation effect produced by repeated reading of a passage, in three adults
who stutter. Zimmermann and Hanley found no evidence
to support the hypothesis that reduced amplitudes and
velocities of articulatory movement were characteristic
of the more fluent speech of adults who stutter. In a
study of treatment efficacy, Story, Alphonso, and Harris
(1996) assessed articulatory dynamics in three adults
who stutter pre- and posttreatment with the Hollins
Precision Fluency Shaping Program. The fluent speech
of these adults posttreatment was produced with lower
displacements and velocities compared to their pretreatment measures.
Another means of assessing articulatory dynamics
is to examine the stability of movement patterns. One
approach has been to seek timing invariances in the
sequencing of peak velocity of upper lip, lower lip, and
jaw movements. Although an early report (Caruso, Abbs,
& Gracco, 1988) suggested that the stability of this sequencing was reduced in adults who stutter compared
to normally fluent controls, later studies failed to replicate this finding (DeNil, 1995; McClean, Kroll, & Loftus,
1990). McClean et al. (1990) found that the fluent speech
of stuttering and nonstuttering adults did not differ on
any of 15 movement parameters, though stuttering
adults who had been in an intensive treatment program
did show longer durations between events (e.g., lag between voice onset and peak velocity of lip movement).
The absence of systematic relationships between kinematic parameters and stuttering severity was also reported by McClean, Levandowski, and Cord (1994). They
focused on articulatory movement timing in a large
group (n = 31) of adults who stutter and found no association between severity of stuttering (measured as conversational disfluency level) and the duration of movement intervals or the variability of timing. They reported
522

that only recent treatment history was associated with
longer durations of intersyllabic movement timing.
In another attempt to replicate the findings of
Caruso et al. (1988), Ward (1997) failed to find differences between stuttering and nonstuttering adults on
relative timing of articulatory peak velocity sequences
and further reported that, even at fast rates, adults who
stutter did not show unusual sequencing patterns. Ward
also employed a phase portrait analysis to assess upper
lip and jaw coordination and found that phase angle
variability was consistently greater in the stuttering
group and that the greatest phase angle variability was
observed at fast articulatory rates and when altered
stress patterns were required.
Given these mixed results, it is difficult to draw any
firm conclusions about the link suggested by Zimmermann
(1980a, 1980b, 1980c) between articulatory kinematic
parameters and fluency. Further, despite the fact that
clinicians routinely slow down the speech of those who
stutter to improve fluency, the kinematic changes associated with reduced speaking rate are unclear. Even in
the case of normally fluent speakers, consistent effects
of speaking rate changes on kinematic parameters have
not been established (reviewed by Adams, Weismer, &
Kent, 1993).
In the present study, the spatiotemporal index (STI)
is employed to assess stability at normal, slow, and fast
speaking rates. The STI reflects the degree to which the
patterning of movement output is consistent on repeated
productions of the behavior. For normally fluent adult
speakers, habitual rate is most stable as indexed by this
measure (Smith et al., 1995). Moving the speaker away
from his or her habitual rate in either faster or slower
directions produces increased variability, with slow rate
most variable. It seems reasonable to postulate that the
collective of neural systems that cooperate to produce
speech movement sequences operate in an extremely
reliable way from utterance to utterance produced at
habitual rate. For slower or faster rates, alteration of
the habitual output pattern is required, so the collective must adapt to producing a new pattern and is not
as reliable at generating this pattern. The present study
explores speech movement pattern generation in adults
who stutter. The goal is to determine if the STI changes
in similar directions across rate conditions for the stuttering and control groups and if a different operating
range (e.g., of movement amplitude and velocity) characterizes the fluent speech of adults who stutter.
As noted above, in Zimmermann's classic set of studies (1980a, 1980b, 1980c), it was postulated that the
speech motor system stability/instability continuum is
related to the fluency/disfluency continuum, with unstable motor systems more likely to experience the
breakdowns perceived as disfluency. Recent theoretical

and experimental work suggests that the relationship
between disfluency and stability may not be so simple.
Investigators studying complex nonlinear systems have
found that increased variability may be adaptive in some
cases (Bassingthwaighte, Liebovitch, & West, 1994). For
example, the rhythmic oscillations of the brain during
epilepsy are not adaptive, but healthy individuals have
greater variability in heart rate than those with heart
disease (Bassingthwaighte et al., 1994; Goldberger,
1992). Previous experimental work has demonstrated
that excessive tremor, which is also a maladaptive, hyperstable state, occurs during the disfluent intervals of
adults and children who stutter (Denny & Smith, 1992;
Kelly, Smith, & Goffman, 1995; McClean, Goldsmith,
& Cerf, 1984; Smith et al., 1993). McClean et al. (1994)
also reported kinematic data suggesting that adults who
stutter are less variable than control subjects. In chaos
(or nonlinear dynamic systems) theory, consistent physiological behavior is often referred to as an attractor.
The attractor is conceptualized as a stable behavioral
state, one that the system is less likely to leave
(Bassingthwaighte et al., 1994; Thelen & Smith, 1994).
Thus it can be suggested that disfluency may be associated with increased stability, and Smith (1999) further
hypothesized that disfluency may be an attractor, a
hyperstable but maladaptive region of operation for the
speech motor system. Therefore the interpretation of a
variability measure such as the STI is complicated, and
it is possible that the data of those who stutter will be
found at either end of the stability/instability continuum.
Finally, the STI is a composite measure of spatial
and temporal variability, which in the present application, is computed over the entire sequence of movement
for a six-syllable phrase. To examine potentially different effects in the timing and spatial domains, fine-grained
analyses of individual movement parameters were also
employed. A simple sentence was repeated at three rates,
thus incorporating an adaptation procedure (Johnson &
Knott, 1937), so that utterances were produced under fluency enhancing conditions for each rate. This also allowed assessment of whether either group experienced
an adaptation effect, such that improved stability of
patterning was observed over the second half compared
to the first half of the series of repeated utterances.

Method
Subjects
Fourteen adults who stutter participated. Based on
SSI (Riley, 1994) scores, their stuttering severity was
rated as mild (8), moderate (3), or severe (3). Participants ranged in age from 21 to 58 years and had no
history of neurological disorders, speech/language (other

than stuttering), or hearing disorders. Five of the 14
were females. Treatment history for this group of adults
varied widely. Three (all classified as very mild) had
never had treatment, and 4 had treatment only as young
children. Seven of the adults who stutter had treatment
recently, and based on self-report, fluency enhancing
strategies included slowed speaking rates, "soft" contacts, and easy onsets, in addition to other management
techniques. To explore potential relationships between
treatment history and some of the kinematic variables
measured, the adults who stutter were divided into two
groups of seven, a recent treatment group (RT) and a no
or child-only treatment group (NT). A group of 14 age-,
gender-, and education-matched normally fluent adults
was also tested. These participants had no history of
speech, language, hearing or neurological disorders.

Experimental Task
Subjects produced the phrase "Buy Bobby a puppy"
[baI babi O pOpi] 20 times at their normal, habitual speech
rate and 20 times at slow and fast rates. The phrases
were repeated in blocks of 5-10 productions. For the fast
condition, subjects were instructed to speak at "twice
your normal rate" and for the slow condition, "half your
normal rate." Durations were estimated by monitoring
the speech acoustic signal on a storage oscilloscope. To
ensure that subjects changed rate in the instructed direction, durational targets were fixed as approximately
.75 of the normal rate duration for the fast condition
and 1.5 x the normal duration for the slow condition.
The experimenter estimated the duration of fast and
slow productions during practice trials. If practice trials did not change appropriately, participants were instructed to speed up or to slow down further.
Because the goal of the experiment was to assess
characteristics of the fluent speech of adults who stutter, productions in which disfluencies occurred were not
included in the analysis. If disfluencies were noted during the experiment, the utterance was repeated so that
15 fluent productions at each rate would be available
for analysis. Two of the adults who stutter were extremely disfluent at the beginning of the session, and
fluency enhancing procedures were used on practice trials. These included having the subject repeat the utterance and, in one case, choral speaking accompanied by
easy onsets and initial consonant lengthening. After
practice, one participant who stutters could not produce
the utterance fluently and was not included in the experimental group of 14. The second of these two participants did achieve fluency after the practice trials and
completed the experimental protocol. No instructions
(other than for the rate change) were given to participants regarding their speech during the data collection
trials.

Data Collection
Participants were comfortably seated in view of an
Optotrak camera system. Small plastic disks containing infrared light emitting diodes were attached to the
skin of the lower lip and forehead at midline. The displacement of the two markers was recorded in three dimensions at a sampling rate of 250 samples/s. To correct the lower lip (plus jaw) displacement signal for head
motion, the composite three-dimensional movement of
the lower lip was computed as the Euclidian distance
between the forehead marker and the lip marker (Smith
& Goffman, 1998). A videotape was made of each participant. From the videotaped record, two observers
judged each utterance as fluent or disfluent, and any
utterance judged as disfluent by either judge was excluded from analysis. An audio signal was also collected
with the Optotrak system so that a synchronous signal
was available to insure that the kinematic data were
associated with the previously judged fluent productions
of the target phrase.

Data Analysis
A three-point difference method was used to compute velocity from the displacement records, and both
signals were displayed on a computer monitor. From the

long files containing multiple repetitions of the utterance, 15 short files were extracted for each rate condition for further analysis. As noted above, utterances containing disfluencies or errors were excluded. As in our
earlier study (Smith et al., 1995), the short displacement
files were selected as the interval from the peak velocity of the first opening movement (release of [b] in the
first syllable) to the peak velocity of the last opening
movement for the utterance (opening to [i] in the last syllable). Figure 1 illustrates typical displacement and velocity waveforms and the points used to extract the record
for the STI and other analyses included in this paper.
The 15 displacement waveforms extracted for each
rate condition were then amplitude and time normalized. Amplitude normalization was achieved by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of
each displacement record. The set of 15 records per condition per subject consisted of variable numbers of points,
depending on the duration of each utterance. For time
normalization, a linear interpolation procedure was used
to force each displacement record for each utterance to
a constant length of 1,000 points. As in our earlier paper,
trigonometric interpolation was used, but the number of
harmonics employed in the resynthesis was increased from
10 to 40 (see discussion of this issue in Smith et al., 2000).
This larger number of harmonics was needed to insure
that 99% of the energy in the longer records (up to 4 s

measured are b-o, b-c, p-o, p-c (b-o and p-o, opening movements for "bob" and "pup"; b-c and p-c,
closing movements for each syllable). The three middle opening velocity peaks used in the relative timing
analysis are pk-1, pk-2, and pk-3.

for some of the adults who stutter speaking at the slow
rate) was represented in the interpolated waveform.

to examine variability in the spatial domain independently of timing variability.

Spatiotemporal Index (STI)

Results

For the sets of 15 time- and amplitude-normalized
displacement waveforms for each rate condition, a standard deviation was computed across the 15 samples at
one point in relative time. The standard deviations were
computed successively at 2% intervals. These 50 standard deviations were summed, and the result, which
reflects the overall spatiotemporal stability across 15
repetitions of the utterance, was called the spatiotemporal index (STI).

Speech Rates

To determine if there was evidence of an adaptation
effect for each participant, two separate STIs were computed for the first and last seven utterances in each condition. These STI values were compared to determine if
speakers became more stable as a result of repeating
the phrase.

Relative Timing
As noted above, displacement waveforms were extracted for analysis as the interval between the peak
velocity of the first and last opening movements. Thus,
the time of peak velocity of the first opening movement
was 0% in normalized time; whereas the time of peak
velocity of the last opening movement was 100%. This
utterance contains five opening gestures of the lower
lip, and the middle three opening movements were used
to assess the variability of relative timing of this articulatory movement sequence (see Figure 1). The relative
times (in percent) of the peak velocity of the three middle
opening movements were measured. These data were
used to determine if, across the three speaking rates,
stuttering and normally fluent adults spend similar
amounts of relative time in each phase of the movement
for the utterance and show similar within-subject variability in timing. This procedure allowed us to examine
variability in the temporal domain independently of
spatial variability.

Participants changed speech rate as expected for the
three conditions. The means and standard deviations of
the total duration of the displacement signal were analyzed for each condition and group: For adults who stutter, normal rate was 1.15 s (0.23); slow rate, 2.50 s (1.1);
fast rate, 0.76 s (0.14). For the normally fluent group,
the normal rate was 0.98 s (0.16); slow rate, 2.12 s (0.46);
fast rate, 0.76 s (0.17). The group of adults who stutter
did not differ from the controls in overall phrase duration [F(1, 26) = 2.30, p > .05].

Spatiotemporal Stability
As illustrated in Figure 2, the mean (and SD) STIs
as a function of rate for each group for adults who stutter were normal rate, 15.8 (4.3); slow rate, 19.3 (3.1);
fast rate, 17.1 (3.6) and, for the control group, normal
rate, 13.2 (2.8); slow rate, 20.2 (5.3); fast rate 15.4 (3.3).
An ANOVA revealed no effect of group on STI [F(1, 26) =
1.24, p > .05].
Rate significantly influenced STIs [F(2, 52) = 19.66,
p < .001], but the Rate x Group interaction was not significant. Collapsed across groups, mean STI for the slow
condition (19.7) was significantly higher than that for
the habitual rate (14.5; Tukey's HSD = 2.06, p < .05);
the fast rate STI (16.2) was not significantly different
Figure 2. Mean (error bars are 1 SD) for the STI for each group
at each rate.

Single-Movement Kinematic
Measures
Duration, displacement, and peak velocity were
measured for four components of the sequence indicated
in Figure 1, the opening and closing movements for "bob"
and "pup." In addition, within-subject standard deviations were computed for movement amplitude over the
15 trials for the two opening movements. These were
normalized to each subject's mean amplitude to produce
a coefficient of variation. This procedure permitted us

from habitual rate. Thus the STI, which is a composite
measure of both spatial and temporal variability in the
output, indicates that on average both adults who stutter and normally fluent controls show lowest stability
on repeated trials when generating this sequence of
speech movements at a slower than habitual rate.
It is well known that individuals who stutter comprise a heterogeneous population, and group statistics
often mask significant individual differences. Further,
as suggested above, individuals who stutter may occupy
either end of the stability/instability continuum. Figures
3 and 4 illustrate this heterogeneity by showing the range
of STIs for the normal and slow rates for two stuttering
subjects, one with an extremely low normal rate STI
and one with a very high value. To further illustrate
this range of behavior, in Figure 5, the STI computed
for slow rate is plotted as a function of the STI for each
individual at normal rate. Based on the present data
and earlier studies of the STI for this utterance spoken
at habitual rate (Kleinow & Smith, 2000; Maner, Smith,
& Grayson, 2000; Smith et al., 1995, Smith & Goffman,

1998), typical adults (n = 54) have a mean of 13.3 and
SD of 2.5. Given this, a normal rate STI (for this utterance spoken by an adult) greater than 18.3 can be estimated as more than two SDs above the mean. Five of the
adults who stutter exceed this criterion, whereas none in
the control sample do. These five individuals also do not
show the group trend of increased STI in the slow condition, rather their slow STI values are approximately equal
to their normal rate STIs. These observations suggest that
there are adults who stutter, approximately one third of
the present sample, who, even under extreme fluency
enhancing conditions, have abnormal levels of instability
in their speech motor output. Figure 5 also illustrates
that one individual who stutters had the lowest STI observed in this study in the normal and slow rate conditions. (This participant's data are shown in Figure 3.)
Finally, it is interesting to note that the data from one
participant, who was rated a severe stutterer and who
required practice trials to become fluent, were unremarkable. The STIs for this subject were 15.0, 16.3, and 20.1
for the normal, slow, and fast rates, respectively.

Figure 3. Displacement records for the habitual rate (left column plots) and slow rate (right column) conditions for one adult who stutters. This
individual represents the most stable end of the continuum over both speaker groups. Note that the STIs for both conditions are low relative to
that of normal speakers (top plot, original data; middle plot, amplitude and time-normalized records; bottom plot, standard deviation as a
function of relative time).

Figure 4. Displacement records are shown for the habitual rate (left column plots) and slow rate (right column) conditions for one adult who
stutters. This individual represents the less stable end of the continuum of the stuttering subjects' data. The STI for the normal rate is high
relative to that of normal speakers, and this speaker showed the unusual pattern of no change in STI from normal to slow rate conditions (top
plot, original data; middle plot, amplitude and time-normalized records; bottom plot, standard deviation as a function of relative time).

Overall Utterance Duration
and STI
It is often posited that individual differences in
speaking rate predict individual differences on variability measures (Crystal & House, 1988; Kent & Forner,
1980). It is suggested that, the slower the speaking rate,
the greater the variability. If this is true, the slower
speakers at each rate would exhibit the highest STIs.
To explore this issue, correlations were computed between STI and duration at each rate. Because the two
groups did not significantly differ on STI or duration,
correlations were computed across the two groups. The
STI/duration correlations were normal rate .17, slow rate
.27, and fast rate .22 (p > .17 for all three r values).
Thus, within a rate condition, variation in duration accounts for very little of the variability in the STI. Further, if speaking rate determined the STI, the fast rate
should produce the lowest values and, of course, it does
not. A significant conclusion from this analysis is that
the STI is not simply an epiphenomenon of rate.

Effects of Adaptation on the STI
To explore the possibility that speakers would improve in spatiotemporal stability after repeating the
phrase, a split-half reliability procedure was adopted.
The 15 utterances used to compute the STI were split
into two groups consisting of the first seven and last
seven tokens. New STI values were then computed for
these sets of seven. For each subject it was determined
whether the last group STI was equal (within 1.0 of the
first STI), greater than, or less than the STI of the first
set. Neither group of speakers showed a consistent trend
for either an increase or decrease in spatiotemporal stability over the last set of repetitions.

Relative Timing of Middle Components
of the Movement Sequence

the three middle opening movements (pk-1, pk-2, pk-3

duration for either group. For example, for the control
group, the first peak occurs at 38% of the total movement time for the slow condition and at 28% for the fast
condition.

in Table 1. The relative time of each peak is similar for
both speaker groups across rates, indicating that the
overall proportion of articulatory time spent in each subcomponent of the utterance is the same for both groups
[F(1, 26) = .68]. Consistent with our earlier finding
(Smith et al., 1995), the proportion of relative time for
each peak does not scale linearly with overall movement

For each participant and each rate, a within-subject standard deviation was computed across the 15 repetitions for the relative time of occurrence of each of
the three middle velocity peaks. These values indicate
how consistent the speaker is in generating the same
relative timing pattern for the utterance at each target
rate. These results are summarized in the graph of Figure 6. There was no difference between the two speaker
groups in overall timing variability [F(1, 26) = .68].
There was an effect of rate on timing variability [F(2,
52) = 6.0, p < .005] and a Rate x Group interaction [F(2,
52) = 3.1, p < .05].
Given the significant interaction, the effect of rate
was analyzed separately for each group. For the normally fluent control group, there was a significant effect of rate on within-subject variability of timing [F(2,
26) = 6.42, p < .005], and, as predicted for this group,
the lowest timing variability measures were observed

at habitual speaking rate. In contrast to the controls,
rate did not significantly affect timing variability [F(2,
26) = .45] for the adults who stutter, suggesting that
adults who stutter are equally variable in timing at habitual and non-habitual speaking rates.

Single-Movement Parameters for
"Bob" and "Pup"
For four movement components of the sequence
(opening and closing movements for "`bob" and "pup"),

displacement, velocity, and duration were measured.
Graphed in Figure 7 are the mean displacements and
peak velocities for the opening movements (opening velocities were obviously negative, but for this and all subsequent Figures, velocity is plotted as positive for easier
interpretation and comparison to displacement plots).
These plots suggest that adults who stutter move less
distance with lower velocity for both opening movements;
however there is considerable variability and overlap
between the two groups. Mean displacements and velocities were also lower for the stuttering group for the

Figure 7. The upper plot shows mean displacements (error bars are 1 SD) for the opening movement for
"bob" and "pup" at each rate for each group. The lower plot shows mean peak velocities for the opening
movement for "bob" and "pup" at each rate for each group. In this and all subsequent figures, negative
opening velocities are plotted as positive, so that higher velocity is "up."

closing movements for these two syllables across all
rates (not graphed). These group differences, however,
were not significant. There were no overall effects of
group on movement duration [F(1, 26) = .94], displacement [F(1, 26) = 2.5, p > .05], or peak velocity [F(1, 26)
= .36]. Moreover there were no significant interactions
of group with rate, word, or movement direction (open
or close).
There was an effect of speaking rate on each of these
three variables. The effect of speaking rate on movement duration [F (1, 26) = 34.9, p < .001], as expected,
was decreased mean duration from slow, to normal, to
fast conditions. The effects of rate on displacement [F(1,
26) = 18.2, p < .001] and on peak velocity [F(1, 26) =
5.35, p < .01] were complicated by interactions with word
and direction of movement. Thus, the effects of rate on
displacement and velocity for each movement were analyzed separately. For the four movements (bob-open, bobclose, pup-open, pup-close), separate ANOVAs revealed
that the effect of rate on displacement and velocity was
significant with p < .005 in all cases. The effect of rate
on displacement was observed as a reduction in movement amplitude in the fast condition compared to the
normal and slow rates. For example, the mean displacements for bob-open (across all 28 subjects, in mm) were
normal rate, 10.3, slow rate, 10.9, fast rate, 8.4. As Figure 7A indicates, the reduction in displacement in the
fast rate was greater for the larger movements for "bob"
than for "pup".
Effects of rate on peak velocity of each movement
were observed as reduced velocities in the slow condition and slightly increased velocities in the fast condition compared to normal rate. For example, the mean
peak velocities for bob-open (across all 28 subjects, in
mm/s) were normal rate, 135; slow rate 114; fast rate,
146. Given the absence of reliable group differences on
these parameters, it appears that, for these measures
of movement performance, rate has similar effects for
both stuttering and non-stuttering groups.
In Figure 8A the mean displacement for each subject for pup-open is plotted as a function of displacement for bob-open (normal rate only); Figure 8B has the
corresponding plot for velocity of the two movements.
Peak velocity and displacement are highly correlated
across the two opening movements, suggesting that individual speakers scale movement amplitude and speed
for the utterance as a whole. Particularly notable, however, is that in both graphs, a group of adults who stutter occupies the low end of the displacement and velocity spaces. In the case of displacement there are six
individuals, whereas for velocity there are seven whose
mean values fall outside the normal range. These graphs
reveal that the trend for the adults who stutter to have
lower peak velocities and displacements is generated by

530

these subjects. Analysis of individual subject data reveals that the same individuals occupy both the lowdisplacement and low-velocity spaces, but that the reduced movement style does not predict STI. These
individuals could have relatively low or high STI values. Finally, eight of the adults who stutter have displacement and velocity parameters well within the normal range.

Spatial Variability
To examine variability in the spatial domain independently of timing, coefficients of variation (CV) were
computed for the 15 opening movements for "bob" and
"pup" for each subject and rate. These results are plotted in Figure 9. There was no difference between the
two groups in movement amplitude variability [F(1, 26)
= .85]. There was a significant rate effect [F(2, 52) =
19.62, p < .001], with the fast rate associated with the
highest CVs. There was no significant interaction of
group with rate or word. There was a significant word
effect [F(1, 26) = 5.0, p < .04]. As Figure 9 indicates,
spatial variability was higher for the smaller opening
movements for "pup" than for "bob."

Effects of Stuttering Severity and
Treatment History
As noted in Methods, the 14 adults who stutter were
heterogeneous in severity and treatment history. Six
were moderate to severe, and 8 were mildly affected.
Regarding treatment history, 7 had never received treatment or only in childhood (NT), and 7 had recently received treatment (RT). For the habitual rate condition,
the group of adults who stutter was subdivided using a
median split on these variables: STI, overall utterance
duration, bob and pup opening displacements; and bob
and pup opening velocities. For the STI, the upper half
comprised three moderate to severe and four mild adults
who stutter; and four RT and three NT. Thus, there was
not a trend for the more severely affected adults to have
higher STIs, nor did treatment history appear to predict this variable. In all of these median splits, only one,
overall duration, was consistently related to severity.
Five of the 7 adults who stutter with overall utterance
durations above the median in the normal rate condition were moderate-severe. Duration was unrelated to
treatment history (4 of 7 had been in treatment recently,
and 3 had not).

Discussion
Our working model of stuttering (Smith, 1990;
Smith, 1999; Smith & Kelly, 1997) has as its central

each subject. In the lower plot peak velocity for "pup" is plotted as a function of peak velocity for "bob" for

tenet that speech motor processes interact with a range
of factors often conceived as remote from the motor system, including cognitive, linguistic, and emotional processes. Further, speech motor processes may be positively or negatively affected by these factors. The present
experiment reduced processing demands by asking participants to repeat a simple utterance at their spontaneous, habitual rate and at slow and fast rates. Thus we
assume that emotional, cognitive, and linguistic factors

would have had minimal effects on motor performance.
Time pressure was the only variable manipulated that
would increase or decrease processing demands. The central objective of this experiment was to assess the speech
motor stability of adults who stutter under fluency enhancing conditions and to determine how alterations in
speaking rate affected their stability, as reflected by a
composite variable, the STI, and by independent estimates of timing and spatial variability.

Implications of the STI
The STI is an indicator of how consistent the motor
pattern for a movement sequence is on repeated productions of the behavior. In past work on groups of young
adults, it has proven to be a reliable kinematic variable,
one that produces predictable mean and variance statistics (Kleinow & Smith, 2000; Maner, Smith, & Grayson,
2000; Smith et al., 1995; Smith & Goffman, 1998). Furthermore, in children (Goffman & Smith, 1999; Smith
& Goffman, 1998) the STI is a reliable indicator of the
development of composite spatiotemporal stability of
performance. Children up to age 12 years (work in
progress) are not adult-like on the STI. In this experiment, the STI was employed to determine if adults who
stutter are more or less stable movement pattern generators compared to a matched, normally fluent group
of speakers.
When the between-group statistics on the STI are
considered, the results of the present experiment demonstrate that adults who stutter are not reliably different from a matched control group; however, examination of the individual subject data indicate that, in fact,
approximately one third of this sample of adults who
stutter had unusually high STI values when speaking
at their preferred, habitual rate. Thus the present findings suggest that some adults who stutter can operate
within normal ranges of speech motor performance, even
when producing speech at fast rates; whereas others
operate on the low end of the stability continuum, even
when speaking at habitual rate under fluency enhancing conditions. It was also noted that one of the adults

532

who stuttered had the lowest STI observed, suggesting
that they may occupy both ends of the stability continuum as assessed by the STI.

Independent Assessment of Temporal
and Spatial Parameters
In the spatial domain, the present data indicate
overlap between the stuttering and nonstuttering adults
in the variability of achieving lower lip/jaw spatial targets, as suggested by analysis of the coefficient of variation of two opening displacements (for "bob" and "pup")
across the three speaking rates. Speaking at faster rates
increased spatial variability for both groups.
When overall timing variability (indexed by the variability of relative timing of the three middle velocity
peaks) was assessed, the group of adults who stutter
did not show greater timing variability across rate; however, follow-up tests prompted by a Rate x Group interaction, indicated that the adults who stutter were not
"better timers" at habitual compared to the slow or fast
rates. In contrast, as would be predicted, normally fluent adults showed significantly reduced variability in
utterance timing when they spoke at habitual rate. This
result was part of a general pattern observed across the
various analyses indicating that adults who stutter are
most different from the controls when they speak at
habitual rate. If these measures of consistency in performance are interpreted within the dynamic systems
framework (see below), they suggest that for some adults
who stutter, the habitual speech mode is not as stable
an attractor as it is for normally fluent speakers.

Implications for Stuttering as a
Disorder of Movement
Previous work has explored articulatory dynamics
of disfluent intervals of speech in adults (Denny & Smith,
1992; McClean et al., 1984; Smith, 1989; Smith et al.,
1993; Zimmermann, 1980b) and children (Kelly et al.,
1995) and has shown that articulatory kinematics are
aberrant and may include tremor, a hallmark sign of
motor speech disorders. In this study we examine behavior at the other end of the fluency continuum, fluent
speech produced under low-demand conditions. The
present results and those from a number of earlier studies (DeNil, 1995; McClean et al., 1990; McClean et al.,
1994) suggest that for many adults who stutter, the articulatory performance range can overlap that of normally fluent adults. Operating in a reduced displacement or velocity range, as suggested by Zimmermann
(1980c), is not a necessary or even a predominant aspect of fluency in adults who stutter.
Our general model (Smith, 1999; Smith & Kelly,
1997) is supported by the present findings and related
results from other physiological investigations of stuttering. Additional support is found in the mounting evidence of the importance of linguistic processes and other
non-motor factors (see review in Bernstein Ratner, 1997).
This recent work suggests that debates focusing on
whether stuttering arises primarily from language or
motor or emotional or other single factors are unnecessary. Rather, an expanded explanatory domain for a
neurophysiological model of stuttering is required. This
domain includes speech motor areas or pathways, such
as reflex loops or cortical sensorimotor areas, but also
must include the interaction of the motor system with
the neural systems that mediate linguistic, cognitive,
and emotional processes. Under this view, stuttering is
a disorder of movement in which a vulnerable speech
motor system is a factor. As the present data indicate,
in many individuals diagnosed as stuttering, the speech
motor system can operate within normal ranges of performance under many circumstances, but it is a system
that is unusually sensitive to the effects of increased
processing demands. This theoretical orientation is reflected in recent work that examines the impact of linguistic variables, such as utterance length and complexity, on articulatory EMG (van Lieshout, Starkweather,
Hulstijn, & Peters, 1995) and kinematic stability
(Kleinow & Smith, 2000) in adults who do and do not
stutter.
In the present results, a vulnerability to disruption of speech motor processes in the group of adults
who stutter is suggested in a variety of ways. In the
normally fluent adult speaker performing at habitual
rate, there is evidence that this process is highly stereotyped when an utterance is repeated. If the cooperative

relationships between and within the neural systems
involved in generating this utterance are highly stable,
the patterned output is stable from utterance to utterance, and the STI is low. It is suggested that the higher
the STI, the less stable the attractor (Smith & Goffman,
1998). From the STI (Figure 2) and relative timing data
(Figure 6), it can be seen that the group of adults who
stutter are consistently most different from the control
group when speaking at habitual rate. They are most
similar to the control group when both are producing
speech at slow rates.
If the habitual speech mode is a less stable attractor
for adults who stutter than it is for normally fluent
speakers, it follows that adults who stutter are more
likely to leave this mode. They can move into a disfluent
operating range, which is also a hypothetical attractor.
A variety of physiological data, including EMG, articulatory movement, and autonomic nervous system measures (Denny & Smith, 1992; McClean et al., 1984; Smith
et al., 1993; Smith, Denny, Shaffer, Kelly, & Hirano, 1996;
Weber & Smith, 1990) suggest that the physiological
correlates of disfluency are variable across subjects but
consistent within a speaker. For example, in the analysis of tremor, EMG intervals extracted from 20 disfluencies from an individual (including a variety of types
of disfluencies) are averaged. The frequency of the tremor
tends to be consistent across disfluencies, so that it
emerges in the average as a clear spectral peak. As another example, subjects who show increased autonomic
arousal before, during, or after disfluent intervals tend
to show the same pattern of increase over multiple
disfuencies (Weber & Smith, 1990). Such observations
lead to the seemingly paradoxical suggestion that
disfluency is a stable behavioral mode for the person
who stutters (Smith, 1999). Instabilities in the fluent
speech of the person who stutters may signal the potential for nonlinear shifts to the disfluent attractor space.
Within this framework, yet another seemingly paradoxical finding is that the slow speech mode is not a more
stable one for adults who stutter. It could be suggested
that although the slow speech operation range is not
stable, as indexed by the STI or relative timing measures, the variability observed in this mode is adaptive.
Variability is not always a negative attribute of a complex system. As Bassingthwaighte and colleagues (1994)
note, "The variables of a chaotic system explore a much
wider range of values than those of a system in rhythmic oscillations. Thus chaos may provide the plasticity
to cope with the exigencies of an unpredictable and
changing environment" (p. 325). Certainly it is reasonable to suggest that speaking is an unpredictable task
that occurs in an ever-changing environment for the
person who stutters.
Also relevant to the suggestion that those who stutter have less stable attractors for motor tasks are data

indicating that subtle instabilities in motor performance
are not limited to speech or oral motor processes. A study
of bimanual performance in a group of adults who stutter and a matched control group revealed that the adults
who stutter spontaneously produced finger movements
of smaller amplitude and had significantly greater
interfinger phase variability (Zelaznik, Smith, Franz,
& Ho, 1997).

Effects of Rate Change, Severity,
and Treatment History
Based on earlier studies (Story et al., 1996; Zimmermann, 1980a) and clinical observations, it seemed reasonable to predict that adults who stutter would show a
low-amplitude, low-velocity movement strategy across
all speaking rates, perhaps enhanced in the slow rate
condition as Zimmermann (1980c) suggested. Although
differences in group means were always in the predicted
direction, there was considerable overlap between the
groups on displacement and velocity measures, and differences were not reliable. Some adults who stutter operated in the low end of the displacement and velocity spaces, but approximately half of the group were
moving normal distances with normal velocities. Speaking rate did not have differential effects on the kinematic parameters of single movements for the two
groups.
The present study includes the largest number of
normally fluent participants ever tested in a kinematic
study of speaking rate change. The findings concerning
the effects of rate change on displacement and velocity
of articulatory movement have been mixed (see review
in Adams, Weismer, & Kent, 1993), and Kuehn and Moll
(1976) suggested that individuals varied in displacement
and velocity trade-offs to achieve target movement durations. However, the present study, probably due to the
larger number of participants, shows statistically reliable effects of rate. There certainly were differences between subjects, but overall, speakers tended to produce
slow speech movements by maintaining habitual displacements and reducing velocity. Speech movements
for faster speaking rates typically involved increased
velocities and decreased displacements; however, the
presence of word ("bob" vs. "pup") and direction (open
vs. close) effects suggests that kinematic modulation
associated with speaking rate change is complex, with
differential effects on subcomponents of the movement
sequence. This may help to explain the mixed results of
earlier studies in which a variety of utterances have been
employed.
From the present results, it may be suggested that
slowing the speech rate of an adult who stutters does
not increase utterance-to-utterance stability within a
534

single articulator, nor does it consistently reduce the amplitude of movement. Slower rates on average do produce
lower velocities of movement, so that velocity-sensitive
receptors would be less activated as Zimmermann (1980b,
1980c) suggested; however, the present data suggest that
position-sensitive receptors would be equally activated
in slow and habitual rates. Thus the reduction in sensory feedback postulated by Zimmermann at slow speaking rates is likely for velocity feedback only. Studies of
dynamic responses of mechanoreceptors in the skin of
the face and spindles in jaw-closing muscles suggest that
these are highly velocity-sensitive (reviewed in Smith,
1992), so that a reduction in movement velocity should
have significant effects on sensory input to reflex and
other neural pathways. Therefore, turning to potential
clinical implications, the benefit of a slow speaking rate
for an adult who stutters may lie partly in operating in
a reduced velocity range, but it also may arise from an
increase in time for cognitive and linguistic processing.
Another potential advantage of a rate change is that
the operating characteristics of the system are simply
changed. Moving the system into a different range of
operating parameters may help to establish new modes
of interaction between the multiple neural systems
whose activity generates speech movement sequences.
This new mode of operation over time may become a
more stable one for the speaker. The precise rate or kinematic output parameters may not be critical, rather
the critical element may be moving the speaker into an
operating mode that is less likely to break down when
processing demands are increased. In conclusion, the
present results suggest that adults who stutter can speak
fluently at habitual and fast rates with articulatory kinematic parameters overlapping those of normally fluent speakers. A challenge for future basic and clinical
research is to determine what factors, including speaking rate and non-motor factors, must be manipulated to
move the individual who stutters to a more stable, less
vulnerable operating range.
