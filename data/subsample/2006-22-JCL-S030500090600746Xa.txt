ABSTRACT

Over the course of acquiring deverbal compounds like truck driver,
English-speaking children pass through a stage when they produce
ungrammatical compounds like drive-truck. These errors have been
attributed to canonical phrasal ordering (Clark, Hecht & Mulford,
1986). In this study, we compared British and Canadian children's
compound production. Both dialects have the same phrasal ordering
but some different lexical items (e.g. answer-phone exists only in British
English). If influenced by these lexical differences, British children
would produce more ungrammatical Verb-Object (VO) compounds in
trying to produce the more complex deverbal (Object-Verb-er) than
the Canadian children. 36 British children between the ages of 3 ;6 and
5 ; 6 and 36 age-matched Canadian children were asked to produce
novel compounds (like sun juggler). The British children produced
more ungrammatical compounds and fewer grammatical compounds
than the Canadian children. We argue that children's errors in deverbal
compounds may be due in part to competing lexical structures.

like turn-wall to refer to an instrument for turning walls (Clark et al.,
1986). While there are some existing Verb-Object compounds in English
(like scarecrow), this form is not productive (Marchand, 1960). Children's
reversals of the order of the Object and the Verb within deverbal
compounds means that they are not simply basing their novel constructions
on other Object-Verb-er compounds in their language. Why might they
make these errors ? One important explanation is that children have heard
verbs and objects in the order ` verb-object ' so frequently that they use
this order in their compounds (Clark et al., 1986). The present study tests
this explanation by investigating the compounds produced by children
acquiring two different dialects of English, both with the same canonical
phrasal order. If children rely only on phrasal order in producing novel
compounds, we should find no differences by dialect.
Deverbal compounds in English
In English, the most productive deverbal compounds are in the form
object+verb+-er (e.g. gamekeeper) and verb+-ing+noun (e.g. chewing
gum ; Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech & Svartvik, 1985), with the latter being
more productive than the former. Object+verb+-er (hereafter OV-er)
compounds preserve an older, no longer active, phrasal ordering in English
(Baker, 1998). There are also other, less productive and less frequent, kinds
of deverbal compounds in English, such as verb+object (VO) compounds
like scarecrow, daredevil, and pickpocket. In North American English, VO
compounds are not productive at all as nominal forms, although they are
sometimes used in adjectival forms, usually with a negative connotation
(e.g. a kiss-ass skirt). In British English, VO compounds are not very
productive as nominals either, although British speakers use some that are
not used in North America, like answer-phone and hold-all.1
Acquisition of compounds in English
While there are several kinds of deverbal compounds in English, the most
studied deverbal compound in acquisition is OV-er. These compounds are
usually acquired late in the preschool years, around five to six years of age
(Clark et al., 1986). A number of factors are thought to influence children's
acquisition of compounds (see review in Clark & Berman, 1984). Three of
these factors that could influence how and when children acquire OV-er
compounds are : frequency and/or productivity, morphological complexity,
[1] There are a few lexical differences between Canadian and American English (such as
residence and dormitory, respectively). To our knowledge, there is no difference between
the two dialects in the kinds of deverbal compounds used.

678

ACQUISITION OF ENGLISH COMPOUNDS

and deviation from typical phrasal ordering. We briefly consider each of
these factors.
Low frequency and high morphological complexity might help explain
why children acquire OV-er compounds only late in the preschool
years. OV-er compounds are low in frequency in child-directed speech
relative to noun-noun compounds (Clark, 1993 ; Nicoladis & Yin, 2002).
Morphological complexity is defined by the inclusion of bound morphemes
in compounds (see Clark & Berman, 1987). OV-er compounds include the
bound morpheme -er and bound morphemes are generally included in
compounds later in acquisition than content words (Clark & Barron, 1988).
The order of the object and the verb in OV-er compounds is different
from the most frequent order of verbs and objects that children hear
(in phrases). Clark and her colleagues (Clark et al., 1986 ; Clark & Barron,
1988) have hypothesized that children base their novel compounds on
canonical phrasal order. This hypothesis helps explain why OV-er
compounds are acquired late (since they have to unlearn phrasal ordering)
and explains the errors that children make over the course of acquisition.
Clark et al., (1986) noted that children pass through a stage around the
age of four years when they produce ungrammatical compounds in the
order Verb-Object. For example, children might say break-bottle, breakingbottle, or breaker-bottle to mean something or someone who breaks bottles.
Note that this hypothesis makes no predictions about which type of
ungrammatical compounds (i.e. VO, VingO or VerO) might be produced.
Some doubt has been cast on the idea that children base their OV-er
compounds on phrasal ordering. Nicoladis (2003) showed that French-
English bilingual children were more likely to produce ungrammatical
VO compounds in English and grammatical VO compounds in French
relative to monolingual children in each language. The canonical phrasal
order of both French and English is SVO so the differences between the
groups cannot be attributed to differences in frequency of ordering verbs
and objects in phrases. However, the groups differ in terms of the lexical
items they may have heard, notably VO compounds are grammatical in
French.
It is possible, then, that children's ungrammatical compounds in the
order Verb-Object are not based exclusively on phrasal ordering, but rather
the order of other complex lexical items in their language. In English,
children hear many examples of deverbal lexical forms (e.g. rolling pin,
roller skate, play house, fire fighter, etc.), most of which have the verbal
element before the noun.
In sum, frequency and morphological complexity probably contribute to
children's late acquisition of OV-er compounds. It is clear from the fact
that children form ungrammatical compounds that they are relying on cues
other than already existing OV-er compounds to form novel ones. It is not
679

MURPHY & NICOLADIS

clear whether they rely only on canonical phrasal order or also on the order
of other deverbal lexical items in their language.
This study
The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that children's
ungrammatical compounds are based solely on canonical phrasal order.
We did this by comparing children's production of novel compounds in
two different dialects of English : British and Canadian. There is no
difference in canonical phrasal order in the two dialects. However, there
are some lexical items in the form VO that exist in British English (like
answer-phone and hold-all) that do not exist in Canadian English. There
are other grammatical VO compounds in both dialects that entered the
language around the 16th century (Marchand, 1960) like pickpocket and
sawbones. Note that these are often pejorative and probably rarely used with
preschool children (except possibly scarecrow).
In order to more objectively determine if there were indeed dialectical
differences in the rate of VO compounds, we compared CHILDES data
(MacWhinney, 2000) from a British corpus and two American corpora (see
Note). The British corpus we used was the Manchester corpus (Theakston,
Lieven, Pine & Rowland, 2001), consisting of 1 523 793 word tokens.
The data were free-play sessions with 12 monolingual children and their
mothers. The children were followed longitudinally for a year starting
from 1; 8 to 2 ; 0. They were recorded every week for one hour. Half the
children were from Manchester and half from Nottingham.
To get even remotely close to that number of token words, we used two
corpora of American English. The Brown corpus (Brown, 1973) consisted
of free-play interactions between adults and three different children,
recorded longitudinally starting between 1; 6 and 2;3 and continuing until
the children were between 2 ; 3 and 5 ; 1. The Gleason corpus (Gleason,
1980) consisted of three sessions with 24 children from 2;1 to 5 ;2: (1) with
the mother alone, (2) with the father alone and (3) at the dinner table
with the mother and the father. Together, these two corpora contained
898 993 word tokens. Notice that we included both children's and adults'
constructions, on the grounds that children's own speech could serve as
evidence for their own acquisition.
It is difficult to identify Verb-Object compounds in English. Of
primary interest to us would be compounds that children identify as being
composed of a bare verb and a bare noun. Because we could not garner
such knowledge from corpora data, we opted instead for counting all
Verb-Object compounds that were written as one word. Using a writtenas-one-word criterion was not a theoretical concern, but a practical one.
By identifying single word Verb-Object compounds, we saved ourselves
680

ACQUISITION OF ENGLISH COMPOUNDS

checking every verb-noun combination that occurred in the corpora. We
have no a priori reason to think that there is a greater tendency to write
Verb-Object compounds as a single word in either British English or
American English.
Another reason it is difficult to identify Verb-Object compounds in
English is that many verbs can also be nouns. For example, in setsquare, is
the word set a verb or a noun ? Where possible, we verified our classifications with the Oxford English Dictionary.
In Appendix 1, we summarize the results of the Verb-Object compounds
that we found in the American and the British corpora. There are very few
of these compounds that appeared in either dialect. As can be seen, only
scarecrow appeared in both dialects. To correct for the differences in the
token number of words in the two corpora, we list each compound and
the number of times (tokens) it appeared in the corpora. There is a higher
token frequency of Verb-Object compounds in the British corpus (about
4 for every 10 000 word tokens) than in the American corpora (less than
1 every 10 000 words).
These findings support the claim that British children are exposed to
more VO compounds than Canadian children, particularly as the
CHILDES database searches are drawn from child directed and child
produced speech, although children hear VO compounds infrequently in
both dialects.
If children base their ungrammatical compounds only on phrasal ordering,
there should be no difference between the two dialects. In contrast, if
children base their ungrammatical compounds at least in part on other
deverbal compounds, the British children should produce more VO
compounds than Canadian children.
METHODS

Participants
The sample included in this study consisted of 36 British English-speaking
children and 36 age-matched Canadian English-speaking children. The
mean age (standard deviation) of the British children was 57.0 months
and the mean age of the Canadian children was 56.6 months. The British
children ranged in age from 41 to 66 months and the Canadian children
from 42 to 67 months. As we matched the children on the basis of age, it
was no surprise to find that there was no significant difference on age by
nationality, t(70)=0.43, p=0.67.
To illustrate developmental changes, some of the results are presented in
terms of three equal-sized (N=12) age groups. The mean age and standard
deviation of these three age groups are presented in Table 1. The ages
across the 3 age groups were also compared and there were no differences

Materials
The children were given two tasks : (1) a vocabulary test and (2) a novel
compound production task. The British children were given the British
Picture Vocabulary Scales (Dunn, Dunn, Whetton & Pintilie, 1982). The
Canadian children were given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III,
Version A (Dunn & Dunn, 1997). These vocabulary tests were devised by
the same authors but were changed to accommodate slight differences in the
dialects. We chose a vocabulary test as a measure of proficiency because
vocabulary scores are related to some aspects of compound acquisition
(Nicoladis, 2003).
For the novel compound production task, we showed children ten
different pictures of machines acting on different objects and asked the
children to give us a name for the machine. The target forms were: apple
eater, banana peeler, bell ringer, book burner, coin dropper, cow brusher, foot
tickler, kite flyer, mouse hugger, and sun juggler. The target bell ringer is
shown in Figure 1. Pilot testing in both Britain and Canada showed that
adults consistently produced the target OV-er forms when asked to name

these pictures. Three practice items were named with target forms : cabbage
cutter, truck pusher and hat waterer. See Figure 1 for details.
Procedure
The children were administered the vocabulary test before the compound
production task.
The compound production task was introduced as ` I am going to show
some funny machines and ask you to name them for me. I'll give you some
examples first. ' The three practice items were presented as ` Here is a
machine that is watering a hat. We could call that a hat waterer.' The three
practice items were always given before the test items. The test items were
introduced with ` Now I'm going to ask you to name the machines for me.'
Each test item was described, for example ` Here is a machine that is brushing
cows. What could we call that ?' The children's answers were recorded. If
a child's answer did not contain both the verb and the object (e.g. cow
and brush), then the child was complimented on his/her first answer and
asked if s/he could think of another name for the machine. Regardless of
the child's second answer, the task was then continued.

RESULTS

The British and Canadian children's scores on the vocabulary test (BPVS
and PPVT) were calculated. Table 2 indicates the number of children who
fell within the different percentile ranges on this test. In both groups, more
than half of the sample scored at or above the 50th percentile. Note
that more Canadian children fell below the 50th percentile than British
children. If children's vocabulary scores are related to their production of
ungrammatical compounds, then Canadian children might produce more
ungrammatical compounds than British children.
The focus of this study was specifically concerned with identifying the
number of OV-er (target) and VO compounds by each group of children
(British and Canadian) and by age. Therefore, only these forms will be

discussed in the analysis below. The average percentage of children's
responses that fell into these categories was a minority of the children's
responses, i.e. 17.8 % of the British children's responses and 28.5% of the
Canadian children's responses. The reason for the low rate of responses
to fall into these compound categories is that children produce a wide
variety of responses on tasks like this, including phrases (e.g. a machine that
is juggling suns), noun-noun compounds (e.g. sun machine), simple nouns
(e.g. suns), V-er forms (e.g. juggler) and some innovative forms (e.g. sunny
hand-to-hand).
Figure 2 summarizes the mean percentage of target forms (OV-er)
and Verb-Object (VO) compounds produced by the children. There was a
significant difference by nationality for both target forms, F(1, 70)=6.39,
p=0.014, and Verb-Object compounds, F(1, 70)=4.07, p=0.048. Thus,
the British children overall produced fewer OV-er compounds and more
VO compounds than the Canadian children.
These means could be biased by the performance of only a few children,
so we also looked at the number of children who produced either the
target form alone (i.e. no VO compounds), VO compounds (i.e. no target
forms), or both forms. These results are presented in Figure 3. As
illustrated in this Figure, there were more British children who produced
VO compounds (either with or without the target form) and more Canadian
children who produced the target form alone. There was a significant
difference between the number of children who produced each form by
nationality, X 2(2)=5.33, p<0.05.
We next examined the developmental patterns in acquisition by dialect.
Figure 4 summarizes the mean rate of target and VO production of the
British children by age. Note that as the children use more target forms,

their rate of VO compounds falls off. However, there is no correlation
between rate of target form and rate of VO form, r(34)=0.032, n.s.
Figure 5 summarizes the mean rate of production of VO and target
forms by the Canadian children. Like the British children, the older
Canadian children produced a higher rate of target forms than the younger
children. Unlike the British children, there was a fairly flat rate of use of
VO compounds by age. There is no correlation between rate of target form
and rate of VO form by the Canadian children, r(34)=x0.160, n.s.
Table 3 summarizes the correlation coefficients for the rate of compound
forms (both target and VO) and age and standardized vocabulary scores.
While both vocabulary size and age are correlates for the Canadian
children's production of target forms, neither factor was a correlate for the
British children.

When not producing either VO or target forms, what did the children
produce ? If their acquisition was based on competition among other lexical
items in their vocabularies, we might expect the form V-ingN (e.g. chewing
gum) to form the basis of most of children's deverbal compounds. Table 4
summarizes the top 6 responses for the British children (all other response
types only occurred two times or fewer) and the top 8 responses for the
Canadian children (all other response types occurred 8 times or fewer). As
can be seen in this Table, for the two compounds under study here, the
target OV-er structure and VO compounds accounted for only 26 % of
the British children's top six responses and 42% of the Canadian children's
top eight. Out of the non-target responses, 82% included -ng for the British
children and 64% for the Canadian children. The single most frequent
non target item produced for both groups of English-speaking children
was deverbal compounds with -ng.

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the frequency
of different complex lexical forms that children hear influences their
development of those forms. Both British and Canadian children hear the
same canonical SVO phrasal ordering and therefore, should produce the
same sorts of compounds at the same rates. Yet the British children, who
hear some VO forms that Canadian children do not hear (e.g. answer-phone)
and hear more VO compounds than Canadian children in the input (see
Introduction), produced more ungrammatical VO forms and fewer target
OV-er forms than Canadian children. These results suggest that even low
frequency lexical forms can affect children's acquisition of other lexical
forms (like OV-er). It is also possible that children's basis for generalizability is not limited to VO compounds : British children also hear more
Verb-Noun compounds (like push chair where Americans say stroller)
where the noun is not the object of the verb than American children (see
Appendix 2). These findings are in line with other studies showing that low
frequency lexical items can affect children's production of compounds
(Nicoladis, 2003). The differences between dialects are problematic for an
account that rests solely on phrasal ordering as an explanation for children's
acquisition of OV-er compounds.
We were surprised that the Canadian children in the present study
produced significantly more target forms than British children. There are
(at least) two possible reasons for this. First, British children might have
at least one more form (i.e. VO) in their ` complex lexical form pot' relative
to Canadian children. That is, given that there seems to be an increased
token frequency of VO forms in British English than Canadian English, this
increase in frequency might result in a different kind of category of compound for British children that is just not relevant for Canadian children.
In other words, perhaps the increased token frequency of VO compounds
for British children ` gets in the way' of British children producing the
687

MURPHY & NICOLADIS

target OV-er. The existence of this VO form might be enough to increase
the probability of producing this form relative to Canadian children. The
increased frequency of this VO form in their dialect may also slow down
their acquisition of the target OV-er form by allowing entrenchment of
ungrammatical forms by the British children. This would at the very
least suggest that the phrasal ordering account needs to be modified to
incorporate the influence of competing lexical forms in different dialects.
Second, it is possible that Canadian children hear more different kinds of
OV-er compounds than British children. If Canadian children were to hear
more OV-er forms than British children, then this (alleged) increased
type frequency of OV-er forms in Canadian English (relative to British
English) might lead to an increased production of this form. This is purely
speculative however, as we do not yet have sufficient data on frequencies
of these different kinds of specific lexical structures in speech addressed
to children. However, in examining the data available in CHILDES
(MacWhinney, 2000), for example, there are very few examples of
compounds of these types in child directed speech (see also Nicoladis &
Yin, 2002).
In this study we found that complex lexical forms with -ing accounted
for many of the children's non-target responses. We think this might
be because children between 3 and 5 years old interpret the low frequency
-er as an alternative for the higher frequency -ing within complex lexical
structures. For example, a brushing-cow and a brusher-cow could be interpreted as the same kind of cow. They may also be influenced by words
such as fisherman, roller skate and player piano in which they may detect no
difference in meaning between a fishing man, a rolling skate and a playing
piano. This explanation would account for the children's high use of
V-ingN in this study (see Table 4; see also Nicoladis, in press).
In sum, the results of the present study point to the likelihood that in
attempting to produce novel deverbal compounds, children base their
productions on the probabilities of complex lexical words they have heard
(e.g. roller skate, rolling pin, street crossing, fire fighter, etc.). We look forward
to studies testing this hypothesis cross-linguistically.
