Substantial evidence continues to accrue for familial transmission of specific
language impairment (SLI). The incidence in families with a history of SLI is estimated at approximately 20%-40%, whereas in the general population the estimated
incidence is about 4%. Typical aggregation studies compare data on the speech and
language status of parents and siblings of individuals with SLI (the probands) to
similar data from family members of control individuals with no speech or language
disorder history. In the present study, family aggregation of SLI was examined for a
unique sample of children who were ascertained before 6 months of age and thus
did not have SLI, but were born into a family with a positive history of SLI (FH+). No
study to date has examined the pattern of affectance in families of children ascertained at such a young age. In addition, the ratio of boys to girls born into such
families was investigated, as previous studies have suggested alterations in the
expected gender ratios. Consistent with prior research, SLI was found to aggregate
in families; the average affectance rate in FH+ families was 32%, with significantly
more boys (41%) reported as having SLI than girls (16%). A comparison of FH+ and
control families (FH-) on sociodemographic factors and medical history revealed
differences in the overall rate of autoimmune diseases; FH+ families reported a
significantly higher incidence (35%) compared to FH- families (9%). Finally, the 3year language abilities of a subset of 32 children from FH+ families were compared
with those of 60 children from FH- families. Children from FH+ families scored
significantly lower on standardized measures of language and were more likely to
fall below the 16th percentile (28%) than children from FH- families (7%). These
results provide converging evidence that children from FH+ families are indeed at
greater risk of developing language delay compared to children from control
families.

Studies reviewed in this article use either specific language impairment (SLI), language
impaired (LI), or developmental language disorder to describe their population. We use the
term SLI, as this most closely describes the proband population. The affected individuals in
this study are considered to have SLI because both inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for
SLI were used to recruit families with a history of language impairment (FH+).

1989a; Tomblin, 1989; Tomblin & Buckwalter, 1998).
Although recent statistics estimate the incidence of SLI
in the general population of 6-year-olds at approximately
4% (Tomblin, 1996), the incidence in families with a history of impairment is estimated at approximately 20%-
40% (Lahey & Edwards, 1995; Neils & Aram, 1986; Tallal
et al., 1989a; Tomblin, 1989). This study describes the
family aggregation and demographic characteristics of
a unique group of children who were born into families
with a history of language impairment (LI) and who were
followed prospectively from 6 months to 3 years of age.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine patterns of familial affectance for children ascertained at
such a young age. Further, as previous studies have
suggested alterations in the expected gender ratios of
children born into such families with a history of SLI
(Tallal, Ross, & Curtiss, 1989b), the present study examines whether such an alteration exists in this sample.
Given the lack of sampling bias as to the gender of the
newborn within the recruited families, this was an ideal
population in which to address this question.
Family aggregation studies obtain information
about the extent to which language-based learning impairments run in families. Data on the speech and language status of parents and siblings of individuals with
SLI are compared to similar data from family members
of control individuals with no speech or language disorder history. Most often, such studies use a retrospective
approach to collect family history information. Thus,
after identifying a proband (the affected individual),
parents or individual family members are asked to complete questionnaires on the language development and
school performance of family members. The results of
these studies have suggested a robust effect of familiality; approximately 40% to 60% of families with a proband with SLI report impairments in at least one other
immediate family member (Bishop & Edmundson, 1986;
Lahey & Edwards, 1995). In a review of 18 family aggregation studies of LI, Stromswold (1998) found that
the incidence of LI in families with a history of LI ranged
from 24% (Bishop & Edmundson, 1986) to 78% (van der
Lely & Stollwerck, 1996; this study also included individuals with reading problems), with an average rate of
46%. In comparison, the incidence of LI in control families ranged from 3% (Bishop & Edmundson, 1986) to
46% (Tallal et al., 1989a), with a mean rate of 18%.
Studies using direct testing methods have reported
similar rates of impairment (Felsenfeld, McGue, & Broen,
1995; Gopnik & Crago, 1991; Plante, Shankman, & Clark,
1996; Tallal et al., 2001; Tomblin, 1996; Tomblin &
Buckwalter, 1994). For example, Tomblin and Buckwalter
(1994) reported that of the 26 families tested, 42% of individuals diagnosed with LI (proband) had at least one
other family member with a speech or language problem. Tallal et al. (2001) also used direct testing to assess
262

the rate of LI in proband and control families and found
that 52% of the proband children (ages 4-14 years) had
affected first-degree family members compared to 15.4%
of control children. Finally, using a prospective longitudinal sample, Spitz et al. (1997) demonstrated that children born into families with a history of SLI have significantly lower scores as toddlers (16-24 months) on
both receptive and expressive language measures when
compared to age-matched peers. In this small sample of
children (10 family history positive [FH+] and 10 control), half of the FH+ children scored 1.5 SDs below the
age-appropriate mean, compared to none of the control
children (Spitz et al., 1997). These results support the
notion that children from FH+ families are at higher risk
for developing delays in language acquisition.

Heritability of Language-Based Learning
Disorders: Twin Studies
In addition to family aggregation studies, behavioral-genetics research has also shown that SLI has a
highly heritable component (for review, see Leonard
1998; for review of methodology and genetics of language,
see Brzustowicz, 1996). These studies report that monozygotic twins show a higher concordance rate for languagebased learning disorders compared to dizygotic twins
(Bishop et al., 1995; Lewis & Thompson, 1992; Tomblin
& Buckwalter, 1998). For example, Bishop et al. (1995)
found higher concordance rates for monozygotic male
twins (70%) on articulation and language disorders compared to dizygotic twins (46%). Similarly, Tomblin and
Buckwalter (1998) reported higher rates of concordance
for poor language achievement in monozygotic twins
(96%) than in dizygotic twins (69%). Finally, Dale et al.
(1998) showed that the more impaired the child, the
greater the genetic contribution.

Factors Associated With LI
Although family history of SLI has been shown to
be the most robust predictor of language outcomes in
children, research has shown that gender, prenatal and
perinatal factors, and family history of autoimmune diseases are also associated with SLI (Benasich, 2002;
Bishop, 1997; Stein, 2001; Tallal et al., 1989b; Tomblin,
1989, 1996, 1997).

Gender
One of the most consistent risk factors for developmental speech and language problems is gender. Many
studies report higher rates of SLI in males compared to
females; the ratio of affected males to females is approximately 2:1 to 3:1 (Bishop, 1997; Flax et al., in press; Lahey
& Edwards, 1995; Lewis, 1992; Rice et al., 1998; Shriberg,

Tomblin, & McSweeny, 1999; Tallal et al., 1989b;
Tomblin, 1989, 1996, 1997; Tomblin & Buckwalter, 1994;
Tomblin, Hardy, & Hein, 1991). For example, in a
nonclinical sample, Tomblin (1996) found that approximately twice as many males were impaired compared
to females. In a more recent study, Flax et al. (in press)
assessed the family aggregation and comorbidity of LI
and reading impairments (RI) by directly testing the immediate and extended family members of SLI probands.
The authors report that the incidence of LI and RI for
males was significantly higher than for females (LI =
45% in males vs. 18% in females; RI = 37% vs. 19%,
respectively). Interestingly, Tallal et al. (1989b) found
that the male-to-female ratio reported in SLI populations was altered only in families in which more than
one individual was affected. Moreover, an affected
mother seemed to have a disproportionate influence on
the gender ratio skew, such that affected mothers had
three times as many male children as female, and nearly
five times as many sons with SLI as daughters. We were
particularly interested in examining these hypotheses
in our sample, as the issue of ascertainment bias by gender (e.g., that boys with SLI are more likely to be diagnosed than girls with SLI; Shaywitz, Shaywitz, Fletcher,
& Escobar, 1990) was not a concern in this group of normal, healthy, preverbal infants who were recruited because
they had a sibling or parent diagnosed as having SLI.

Autoimmune Disease
Recent research seems to indicate that SLI may cooccur with certain types of health-related problems. Associations among autoimmune disorders, left-handedness, and learning disability were originally proposed
by Geschwind and Behan (1982, 1984) and since then
have been vigorously investigated (see Bryden, McManus,
& Bulman-Flemming, 1994; Gilger et al., 1998). Specifically, a number of studies have reported a higher incidence of language-related disorders in individuals with
autoimmune disorders (Geschwind & Behan, 1982, 1984;
Gilger, Pennington, Green, Smith, & Smith, 1992; Wood
& Cooper, 1992). Other studies have suggested a higher
incidence of autoimmune disorders in individuals with
language disorders (Hugdahl, Synnevag, & Satz, 1990;
Pennington, Smith, Kimberling, Green, & Haith, 1987).
Such relations, however, have not been consistently
found across studies and remain highly controversial
(e.g., Biederman et al., 1995; Bryden et al., 1994;
Flannery & Liederman, 1995). Theories have been put
forth by Stein (2001) and Gilger et al. (1998) to attempt
to explain these reported relations, by suggesting a
maternal effect on the fetus that modifies the offspring's
immunological profile, thus invoking the possibility of a
neural-immune interaction. Interestingly, a recent study
that suggests that children born into families with a
history of autoimmune disease may be at higher risk

for delayed language development supports this interpretation (Benasich, 2002). As the Benasich research was
a pilot study that examined a small subset of infants (n
= 11), we were interested in investigating this phenomenon in a larger, more heterogeneous sample.

Goals of the Current Study
The purpose of the present study was to describe
the aggregation of SLI in families using a prospective
early onset model. Further, in order to detect potential
mediators of later language abilities, FH+ and control
families (FH-) were compared on factors shown to be
associated with language ability (e.g., demographic indicators, gender, prenatal risk, and family medical history). We were also very interested in exploring the possibility of altered gender ratios within families with one
or more SLI individuals (cf. Tallal et al., 1989b), as a
majority of our FH+ families included two or more children. Language outcomes for a subset of children who
had reached their 3-year assessments were also examined to provide support for the observation that the language abilities of children from FH+ families are lower
as a group when compared to children from control families. Further, nonverbal reasoning abilities were also
assessed in order to ascertain whether FH+ and FH-
control children differed only in the language domain.
Finally, children from both FH+ and FH- families whose
performance on a standardized language assessment was
below the 16th percentile (low-language group) were compared to children whose scores were above the 16th percentile cutoff (normal-language group) on factors such
as gender, demographic indicators, and family history of
asthma and autoimmune disorders to determine the contribution of such factors to 36-month language ability.
The data presented in this article are a synthesis
across several ongoing longitudinal studies, and the
uniqueness of this report arises from the methodology
and criteria used for the recruitment of FH+ children.
Children in these studies were ascertained early in the
first year of life (by 6 months of age) and were born into
families with a history of SLI (FH+). The criteria used
for selecting FH+ families were considered to be conservative and more rigorous than those used in previous
aggregation studies; probands (i.e., a sibling or parent
of the study child) were required to provide confirmatory external reports of an LI and normal general cognitive abilities. As yet, we do not know what proportion of
the infants recruited into these studies will eventually
be diagnosed as having SLI and what proportion will
develop normal language. However, the opportunity is
presented to compare those children whose language
acquisition, at 3 years of age, is below average compared
to those whose skills are within the average range, irrespective of family history, for both family aggregation

and gender distribution. We can also compare gender
ratios within the family, as the sex of the proband was
not considered in ascertaining this sample.

Method

Moreover, comparison of the FH+ and FH- groups included here on birth weight and gestational age revealed
no group differences (see Table 1). Hence, birth weight
and gestational age are not included in any of the analyses presented here.

Participants

Selection Criteria for FH+ Group

One hundred thirty-six infants from 112 families were
included in these analyses. Families were recruited from
New York City, Newark, and surrounding New Jersey
suburbs and were assigned to one of two groups on the
basis of parental report of family history of SLI: the FH+
or the FH- group. The FH+ group consisted of 42 infants
from 37 families in which at least one nuclear family member (the proband) was diagnosed with SLI. The FH- group
consisted of 94 infants (75 families) with no reported family history of SLI or of dyslexia, attention deficit disorder,
pervasive developmental disorder, or autism.

Infants from FH+ families were recruited from local (New York City, Newark, and New Jersey suburbs)
obstetric and pediatric practices. In order to be classified as FH+, families provided clinical reports of expressive and receptive language scores and a general cognitive score for at least one affected child or parent (the
proband). If the language scores for the proband were
at least 1 SD below the age-appropriate mean and if
performance on standardized tests of general cognitive
ability was within the normal range, the family was recruited into the FH+ group. A parent was considered to
be a proband if he or she met the inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for SLI; clinical or school evaluations
of school-aged language and cognitive skills were provided and the diagnosis was reviewed and verified by
speech-language pathologists at our laboratory. Families in which the proband had a diagnosis of pervasive
developmental disorder or autism were not included in
these analyses. Families with children who received a
primary diagnosis of attention deficit disorder or families with children who had LIs because of hearing loss,
neurological disorders, or oral motor impairment were
not included in this sample. Control families reported
no known history of LIs or learning impairments in the
nuclear or the extended family (grandparents, aunts,
and uncles). Seventy-six percent (28 of 37) of families
identified a child as the proband, and significantly more
male children (70%) were identified as SLI probands

The "pooled" sample used in this study comprised
children who were participating in several longitudinal
studies examining the association between early processing of auditory information and language development. Although children received different experimental protocols across studies, the standardized language
assessments administered were consistent across the
different study protocols. Thus, we only examined the
familial aggregation issues described above. The results
of the main hypotheses regarding changing linguistic
performance across time and concerning rapid auditory processing as a predictor of subsequent outcome
are presented elsewhere in more detailed formats
(Benasich & Spitz, 1999; Benasich & Tallal, 1998,
2002). Although prematurity and/or low birth weight
(LBW) are considered risk factors for SLI, in this sample
prematurity and/or LBW were exclusionary criteria.

than were female children (30%), 2 = 7.00, p < .05. For
24% (9 of 37) of the families, a parent(s) was identified
as the proband; four mothers, three fathers, and (in two
families) both parents were identified as probands.

Measures
Demographic Data
At study induction, parents were asked to complete
a 24-item questionnaire. From this questionnaire, basic
demographic information (parental age, marital status,
education, and income) and details of the enrolled
infant's pre- and postnatal development (e.g., prenatal
complications, gestational age, birth weight, otitis media, hospitalizations, and developmental complications)
were obtained. The mother was the primary informant
in most cases; however, both parents were asked to report on family medical history (allergies, asthma, and
autoimmune diseases such as juvenile onset diabetes,
lupus erythematosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
arthritis, Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, etc.), and to
provide information on language and learning problems
in the nuclear (mother, father, and siblings) and extended
(grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) family. Questionnaire items used to query family history of language
and learning disabilities and family medical history are
presented in the Appendix.

Language and Cognitive Assessments
At 3 years of age, children were administered a battery of standardized language and cognitive assessments.
The Preschool Language Scale-3 (PLS-3; Zimmerman,
Steiner, & Pond, 1992) yields standardized scores for
both receptive and expressive language. The mean for
the receptive, expressive, and total scores for the PLS-3
is 100 points, with a standard deviation of 15 points.
Two subtests of the Clinical Evaluation of Language
Fundamentals-Preschool (CELF-P; Wiig, Secord, &
Semel, 1992), Sentence Structure and Word Structure,
were also used to assess language skills. Sentence Structure evaluates comprehension of sentence formation
rules, whereas Word Structure evaluates the child's use
of morphological rules and forms. Both subtest standard
scores have a mean of 10 points and a standard deviation of 3 points. A speech-language pathologist administered both of these assessments in the laboratory and
was not aware of the child's family history.
The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, 4th edition
(SB-4; Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986) was also administered; two subscales--verbal reasoning-vocabulary
and verbal reasoning-comprehension--were also used
to index children's language ability. The quantitative reasoning-quantitative subscale was used to index nonverbal reasoning abilities. The SB-4 subscale scores have a

mean of 50 points and a standard deviation of 8 points.
This assessment was administered by trained psychologists who were blind to the group status of the child.

Results
Family Aggregation of SLI
The Rate of SLI in Families
On average, FH+ families consisted of 4.55 nuclear
family members (including the "identified proband") and
reported SLI in 1.65 individuals (32.26%). Twenty families reported that the proband was the only impaired
member (20 of 37; 54%) in the nuclear and extended family. Eleven families reported 2 or more nuclear family
members with SLI (11 of 37; 30%), and 6 families reported 2 or more members in the nuclear and the extended family with SLI (6 of 37; 16%). The average number of affected members in the multiply affected families
was 2.2 individuals. Importantly, there were no differences in the size of the nuclear family for those reporting 1 affected individual (M = 4.40) and those reporting
multiply affected individuals (M = 4.76), F(1, 36) = 1.433,
p > .20.

Affected Family Members
Of the 56 affected family members in this study,
there were significantly more impaired males (n = 39)
than impaired females (n = 17), 2(1) = 8.64, p < .005.
Families reported that sons were most likely to be impaired (23 of 56; 41%), followed by fathers (10 of 56; 18%),
daughters (9 of 56; 16%), mothers (6 of 56; 11%), and
then extended family members (uncles = 2 of 56, 4%;
grandfathers = 2 of 56, 4%; cousins = 4 of 56, 7%). In the
following analyses, rates of affectance are presented only
for nuclear family members.

Specific Patterns of Affectance
Within Families
Although only 1 child in a family was identified as
the proband (17 of 28, 61%), a number of families reported SLI in more than 1 child. Eight families reported
SLI in 2 sons (28.6%), 1 reported SLI in 2 daughters
(3.6%), 1 reported SLI in a son and a daughter (3.6%),
and 1 reported SLI in 2 daughters and a son (3.6%).
There were no differences in the family size for male
and female probands (mean family size for males = 5.00,
females = 4.62), F(1, 28) = 1.29, p > .50.
Of the 20 families within which a male child was identified as the proband, 10 families reported impairments
in 2 or more children (50%). In contrast, of the 8 families
with an SLI daughter, only 1 family reported impairments
in 2 children (12.5%). A chi-square analysis revealed a
significant association between the gender of the impaired

proband and the number of affected children in the family, 2(1) = 3.68, p < .05. Additionally, SLI males were significantly more likely than SLI females to have a male
sibling with impairments, 2(1) = 5.31, p < .05. Eight of
the 11 siblings identified as impaired were boys (73%).
There were no differences between SLI males and females
with regard to rate of impairment for female siblings, 2(1)
= 2.53, p = .29.
In families where the parent was identified as the
proband, most (7 of 9, 78%) reported only 1 parent with
a history of SLI, and in these families only 1 child (1 of
7, 14%) had a language delay. In the 2 families where
both parents were affected, only 1 child (1 of 2, 50%)
was reported as affected. There were no associations between the gender of the impaired parent and the number of impaired children in the family, 2(1) = 0.97, p >
.50. However, because of the very small number of affected parents and children, any interpretations about
the relationship between affected parents and offspring
is speculative at best.
Gender Distribution in FH+ Families. Given reports
of alterations in the male:female birth ratio in SLI families (Tallal et al., 1989b), we were interested in the relation between the gender of the SLI proband and the
average number of male and female children in the family (irrespective of impairment). On average, male probands had significantly more brothers (M = 1.45 brothers vs. 0.5 sisters), whereas female probands had
significantly more sisters (M = 1.25 sisters vs. 0.25 brothers), 2(1) = 12.8, p < .05.

demands of the recruitment criteria: The majority of the
FH+ families had at least 1 child with a diagnosis of SLI
and a young infant. In contrast, control families could have
only 1 child and be recruited into the study. Thus, as a
group, FH+ parents tended to be older than FH- parents.
There were no group differences in the level of maternal
and paternal education: On average, both fathers and
mothers had completed more than 3 years of education
beyond high school. According to the Hollingshead Four
Factor index of socioeconomic status (Hollingshead, 1975),
families from both groups were classified as "major business people" or "professionals" (e.g., doctors, lawyers, business owners, etc.) and there were no between-group differences in socioeconomic status.
Family Medical History. The following analyses assessed whether there was a greater likelihood that FH+
families would report a familial history of asthma and
autoimmune diseases (e.g., juvenile onset diabetes, lupus erythematosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, etc.) than would
FH- families (see Table 2). Overall, FH+ families were
more likely to report a family history of autoimmune
diseases, but not asthma, as compared to control families. Specifically, 35% of families at risk for SLI reported
a history of autoimmune disorders as compared to 9%
of control families, 2(1) = 11.22, p < .001.

Language Abilities at 3 Years: Patterns
Across and Within Groups

The relationship between parent affectance and the
gender distribution of children within the family (irrespective of impairment) was also assessed. The results
revealed that although SLI fathers had approximately
equal numbers of daughters (1.18) and sons (1.27), SLI
mothers had significantly more daughters than would
be expected (1.83 vs. 0.37), t(5) = 3.953, p < .05.

The following analyses examined data, across
within-laboratory study groups, from the subset of children who had completed their 3-year follow-up language
assessments (N = 92). First, differences between FH+
(n = 32) and FH- (n = 60) groups on language outcomes
at 3 years of age were explored. The language measures
used were the Expressive and Receptive scales of the
PLS-3, the Sentence Structure and Word Structure

In order to identify potential mediators of later language abilities, FH+ and FH- families were compared
on demographic variables (e.g., parental age, education,
socioeconomic status, number and gender of children)
and family history of medical disorders (e.g., autoimmune diseases and asthma). Table 1 presents the mean
and standard deviations of the family characteristic

Verbal Comprehension subscales of the SB-4. The quantitative reasoning subscale of the SB-4 was used to index nonverbal reasoning (see Table 3).

Difference Between FH+ and FH-
Groups on 3-Year Language Measures
Results of a 2 (family history group) x 3 (language
scales of the PLS) analysis of variance (ANOVA) show
that although the mean scores for the FH+ and FH-
groups fell within the normal range, the FH+ group earned
significantly lower scores than the FH- group on both the
Expressive and Receptive subscales and on the total language scale of the PLS-3 (see Table 3). A similar 2 x 2
ANOVA with the CELF-P revealed that children from the
FH+ group performed less proficiently on the Word Structure subtest but not on the Sentence Structure subtest.
Finally, a 2 x 3 ANOVA was conducted using the Verbal
Reasoning-Vocabulary, Verbal Reasoning-Comprehension, and Quantitative Reasoning-Quantitative subscales
of the SB-4. Overall, FH+ children's performance on the
Comprehension and Vocabulary subscales was significantly lower than that of FH- children. The data revealed
no group differences in performance on the nonverbal
quantitative reasoning subscale (see Table 3).
Although we did not have speech sample data for
children at age 3 years, parents completed the MacArthur
Language Inventory (Fenson et al., 1993) at 24 months
and from it we coded the mean sentence length (MSL)
and mean sentence complexity. Comparison of FH+ and
FH- children on both of these measures at 2 years showed
that FH+ children had significantly shorter MSL (M =
3.23 vs. 4.85) and used less complex sentence structures
(M = 5.23 vs. 10.37) than FH- children (see Table 4).

The Association Between Language
Ability and Family History of SLI
For the following analyses, children were classified
into either a low-language group or a normal-language
group on the basis of their performance, at age 3 years,
on the Expressive and Receptive language scales of the
PLS-3. Children who scored below the 16th percentile,
irrespective of family history, were classified as having
low language scores. The two groups were well separated
by PLS-3 scores, with the means for the low-language
group (expressive = 78.53, SD = 10.39; receptive = 80.07,
SD = 14.81; total = 77.15, SD = 13.17) being significantly
lower (p < .001) than the means for the normal-language
group (expressive = 107.21, SD = 14.75; receptive = 112.40,
SD = 14.68; total = 110.94, SD = 14.97). Thirteen of the
92 children (14.5%) had language scores below the 16th
percentile on the PLS-3. Nine of these children were from
FH+ families. A chi-square analysis showed that children
from FH+ families were more likely to be in the low-language group than children from FH families (28% vs. 7%),
2(1) = 7.720, p < .005.
The means and standard deviations for the low- and
normal-language groups for the SB-4 and CELF-P are

Discussion
The purpose of these analyses was to describe family aggregation of SLI in a unique population of children who were born into FH+ families and ascertained
early in the first year of life. Issues regarding possible
alteration of gender ratios within SLI families were examined (Tallal et al., 1989b), as were questions regarding higher incidence of SLI being diagnosed in boys compared to girls (Shaywitz et al., 1990). This was an ideal
group within which to address such issues, as our sample
comprised a group of normal, healthy, preverbal infants
who were recruited because they had a sibling or parent diagnosed as having SLI. Moreover, sampling bias
could not have affected the gender of the newborn within
the recruited families. We also explored whether differences in the expression of SLI in FH+ and FH- families were associated with family environment (demographic and parental factors) and/or family history of
medical disorders (autoimmune disorders and asthma).
Then, using a prospective early-onset research design,
the language skills of a subset of these children at age
3 were examined and potential predictors of poor language abilities, such as family history of SLI, family
medical history, socioeconomic status, and parental
education, were explored. Although this was primarily a descriptive study, some very interesting patterns
emerged.
Consistent with previous research (Bishop, 1997),
we found that SLI did, in fact, aggregate in families
and that there were no differences between FH+ and
FH- families on basic environmental risk factors such
as socioeconomic status or level of parental education.
With regard to family medical history, both FH+ and
FH- families reported first-degree family members
with asthma and autoimmune disease. However, the
overall rate of autoimmune diseases in FH+ families
was significantly higher than that reported by FH-
families.
This study also demonstrated that at 3 years of age,
children from our FH+ families were much more likely
than FH- control children to have lower scores on measures of language comprehension and expression. As a
group, children from FH+ families earned lower scores
on the Expressive and Receptive scales of the PLS-3,
the Word Structure subtest of the CELF-P, and the Verbal Comprehension and Vocabulary scores of the SB-4.
This appears to be a specifically targeted effect, as there
were no differences between the two groups on quantitative (nonverbal) reasoning. Thus, our findings suggest
that the differences observed in our sample at this age
are limited to the language domain and cannot be attributed to a more generalized deficit. In the following
section, we discuss these findings in more detail.

Family Aggregation of SLI and Specific
Patterns of Impairment
The affectance rate of 32% reported in this study
is comparable to rates reported in earlier aggregation
studies (Beitchman, Hood, & Inglis, 1992; Bishop &
Edmundson, 1986; Lahey & Edwards, 1995; Rice et al.,
1998; Tallal et al., 1989a, 2001; Tomblin, 1989). Consistent with previous reports, we found that nearly half of
the families enrolled in the study reported only one SLIaffected member. These findings concur with studies that
have shown that a large proportion of SLI families report a single affected individual (i.e., isolates; Tallal et
al., 1989a; Tallal, Townsend, Curtiss, & Wulfeck, 1991;
Tomblin, 1989). For example, Tallal et al. (1991) reported
that 35% of their LI probands did not have immediate
or extended family members with any form of languagebased learning disorders. In an earlier study with the
same participants, a bimodal distribution of the number of relatives affected was reported such that most
families had impairment rates of 0 or greater than 0.32;
either only the proband was affected or several nonproband family members were affected (Tallal et al.,
1989a). A similar distribution existed in our population.
The average FH+ family consisted of 3.6 members, excluding the proband, and in approximately half of the
families where only one affected member (the proband)
was identified, the average impairment rate was 0 (excluding the proband). In the other half of the families,
the affectance rate was 48%, suggesting that at least
two other family members, excluding the proband, were
also affected (see Tomblin, 1989, for discussion of simplex and multiplex families).

Gender Distribution in SLI Families
Consistent with previous research, FH+ families
reported more males with SLI, and most of the affected
individuals were sons (Bishop, 1997; Flax et al., in press;
Lahey & Edwards, 1995; Lewis, 1992; Rice et al., 1998;
Shriberg et al., 1999; Tallal et al., 1989b, 2001; Tomblin,
1989, 1996, 1997; Tomblin & Buckwalter, 1994; Tomblin
et al., 1991). Further, the 3-year-olds' language scores
also show that boys born into FH+ families were more
likely to score below the 16th percentile than were boys
born into FH- families. Recent epidemiologically based
studies have not found a differential distribution of SLI
based on gender (Rice et al., 1998; Shaywitz et al., 1990).
One reason often given for the differences observed between clinically referred and epidemiological samples
is ascertainment bias, that is, the contention that boys,
rather than girls, are much more likely to be referred
for clinical services for related behavioral and attentional
issues (Shaywitz et al., 1990). This may indeed be the
case; however, we identified the children in this sample

Choudhury & Benasich: Family Aggregation Study

269

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Bibliotheek Der Rijksuniversiteit on 03/14/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions

as normal, healthy infants. Although ascertainment biases might explain the gender differences (a preponderance of males) observed for the SLI probands, the finding that more male siblings of the proband had poorer
early language attainment cannot be explained by ascertainment bias. Moreover, although it is possible that
parental bias could inflate the reporting of language
delay in brothers of the SLI proband, it is unlikely that
the higher rate of language delay we identified by direct testing in the FH+ boys at 3 years of age can be
explained in this way. Thirty-five percent of FH+ boys
were classified as language delayed, compared to 20%
of the girls. The gender distribution of impaired children in FH- families was more proportionate (8% for
boys vs. 6% for girls). Further, recent research using direct testing methods reports an even greater sex ratio
difference between boys and girls (Tallal et al., 2001).
Taken together, these findings suggest that when SLI
aggregates in families, there is a higher rate of impairment in males born into FH+ than there is for females
or males born into FH- families.
Finally, the issue of male-to-female gender alternation in FH+ was also explored. Previous studies (Tallal
et al., 1989b) have reported that mothers with LI had 3
times as many sons as daughters and nearly 5 times as
many sons with SLI as daughters with SLI. The current study was not able to replicate these findings, and
in fact found that affected mothers were more likely to
have daughters. One potential explanation of these findings may be the small sample size of affected mothers
(n = 4). In general, issues of affected parents and alterations in the gender ratios of offspring could not be adequately addressed given the very few affected parents
in this group. Thus, examination of an epidemiological
sample with sufficient power to examine subsets is necessary to further explore this issue.

Association Between Family History
of SLI, Demographic Factors, and
Family Medical History
There were no differences between FH+ and FH-
families on demographic variables such as socioeconomic
status or parental education. Moreover, at the 3-year
longitudinal assessment point, lower language skills
were not related to any demographic variables. These
results support previous retrospective studies that show
that the occurrence of SLI in families is unlikely to be a
consequence of differences in environmental factors
(Bishop, 1997).
Interestingly, however, we were able to show that,
overall, families with a history of SLI were significantly
more likely to report autoimmune diseases than were
FH- families. We also found that children whose language
270

abilities were below the 16th percentile at age 3 were more
likely to have a family history of autoimmune problems if
they had a family history of SLI. Although these findings
must be interpreted with caution because of their preliminary nature, it is possible that autoimmune disorders
covary with a particular phenotype of SLI and that there
may be a core deficit that leads to the expression of both
disorders. One interesting theory suggests that maternal
prenatal mechanisms and/or possible neural-immune
interactions might directly, or perhaps through genetic
mediation, affect the developing fetus (Gilger et al., 1998;
Stein, 2001). Our findings provide some support for that
theory; however, as in the case of patterns of parental-
offspring affectance, a large well-controlled epidemiological study is needed to address the questions raised (see
Benasich, 2002, for a discussion of these issues).

Conclusions
The study reported here shows that SLI does in fact
aggregate in families and that the risk for developing SLI
is significantly higher for children born into families with
a history of such disorders. This pattern of results was
seen within a sample of infants that were identified by
virtue of being born into families at high risk for SLI and
then included in a prospective longitudinal study. These
aggregation results echo, support, and extend previously
reported findings using retrospective techniques. Additional support is provided for the premise that there is a
gender specificity to SLI, as more boys than girls were
affected among the probands. More important, within our
carefully ascertained infant sample, children who were
performing poorly on measures of language at 3 years of
age were more likely to be FH+ boys than FH- boys, or
girls of either background (FH+ or FH-). A provocative
finding concerns the higher reports of autoimmune disorders within the families of children already at high risk
due to family history of SLI. The present study is one of
the first to prospectively examine familial aggregation and
the incidence of language impairment from infancy and
to determine the shifting patterns of deficits across early
development and acquisition of language skills. Continued prospective assessment and analysis of the patterns
of morbidity in these children and their families will allow relations between early deficits and subsequent SLI
to be better defined.
