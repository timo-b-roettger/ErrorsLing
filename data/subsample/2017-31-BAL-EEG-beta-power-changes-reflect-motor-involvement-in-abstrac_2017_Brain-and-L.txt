Brain oscillations in the a- and b-range become suppressed during motor processing and motor imagery.
It has recently been discussed that such power changes also occur during action language processing. In
our study, we compared b2-oscillations (16-25 Hz) during the observation of prototypical arm movements (revealed via motion tracking) as well as during semantic processing of concrete and abstract
sentences containing arm-related action verbs. Whereas we did find a strong desynchronization in the
b2-range during action observation, the processing of action sentences evoked a rather weak desynchronization. However, this desynchronization occurred for action verbs in both concrete and abstract
contexts. These results might indicate a tendency for abstract action language to be processed similar
to concrete action language rather than abstract sentences. The oscillation patterns reflect the close
relationship between language comprehension and motor functions - one of the core claims of current
theories on embodied cognition.

1. Introduction
Brain oscillations in the l- and b-range of the human EEG are
strongly related to sensorimotor processes and sometimes
regarded as idling rhythms that are apparent as long as the sensorimotor system is in a resting state (Baker, 2007; Kuhlmann, 1978).
Whereas oscillations in the l-range are considered to originate in
the somatosensory system, the b-rhythm might rather be linked
to the motor system (Pfurtscheller & Neuper, 1997; Ritter,
Moosmann, & Villringer, 2009). However, it has been observed that
l-oscillations become suppressed during action execution, action
observation, and even during motor imagery (McFarland, Miner,
Vaughan, & Wolpaw, 2000; Pfurtscheller, Brunner, Schlogl, &
Lopes da Silva, 2006). Pfurtscheller, Stancak, and Neuper (1996)
and Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva (1999) gave a detailed description of event-related l- and b-rhythm synchronization (ERS) and
desynchronization (ERD) processes in relation to voluntary hand/
wrist movements. An ERS is defined as an increase of amplitude
after the onset of a certain stimulus, which goes back on numerous
neurons firing at the same time. In contrast, in case of an ERD, the
synchrony of the respective neuronal assemblies decreases, which

in turn causes a decrease of amplitude (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da
Silva, 1999). For self-paced finger movements, Pfurtscheller et al.
(1996) reported l- and b-rhythm desynchronization in the
Rolandic region contralateral to the hemisphere processing action
execution, which started 2 s before movement onset. Immediately
before the movement, this desynchronization became symmetrical
bilaterally. During the movement, a bilateral ERD was reported.
Whereas the recovery of the l-rhythm took about 2-3 s after
movement offset, b-oscillations (16-20 Hz) showed a rather quick
recovery to the baseline within 1 s after movement offset.
Additionally, the b-range showed a short contralateral postmovement ERS (b-rebound) (Pfurtscheller et al., 1996). Hari et al.
(1998) analyzed the neuromagnetic b-rebound in precentral motor
cortex in a frequency range between 15 and 25 Hz while
participants manipulated an object and while they were observing
someone else manipulating the object. They additionally stimulated the median nerves in both arms. Compared to a neutral
baseline condition, in which the nerves were stimulated during
rest, the b-rebound disappeared when participants manipulated
the object and got strongly reduced when they observed action
execution (Hari et al., 1998). In an MEG study with a similar design,
Jarvelainen, Schurmann, and Hari (2004) analyzed the poststimulus rebound during goal-directed and non-goal-directed chopstick use observation. In addition to a stronger suppression of the
rebound during goal-directed tool manipulation, the difference to

the rebound related to non-goal-directed manipulation was correlated with the participants' experience in chop-stick usage. Beside
their relevance for the mirror neuron system, these findings indicated an experience-based responsiveness of motor-related brain
oscillations (Jarvelainen et al., 2004). Hari et al. (2014) further
observed that two different neural processes might occur during
action observation: one which depicts itself as a decrease of MEG
power between 7 and 15 Hz and is considered to reflect mirroring
activity, and another, showing an increase in cortex - muscle
coherence around 18 Hz, which might suppress action imitation.
Beside their sensitivity towards voluntary movements, b-power
changes are related to various aspects of language processing (for a
detailed discussion see Weiss & Muller, 2012a). They are responsive to both syntactic and semantic violations (Bastiaansen,
Magyari, & Hagoort, 2010; Davidson & Indefrey, 2007; Luo,
Zhang, Feng, & Zhou, 2010; Weiss & Muller, 2003), reflect binding
processes at the word and sentence level (von Stein, Rappelsberger,
Sarnthein, & Petsche, 1999; Weiss & Rappelsberger, 1996; Weiss
et al., 2005), and are related to verbal memory processes
(Bastiaansen et al., 2010; Weiss & Rappelsberger, 2000). Further,
b-oscillations are very sensitive towards dissociation between concrete and abstract concepts (Weiss & Muller, 2013; Weiss &
Rappelsberger, 1996, 1998). Recently, in the context of the embodied language theory, studies revealed that power decreases in the
b- as well as the l-band are correlated with the processing of concrete action related language (Alemanno et al., 2012; Fargier et al.,
2012; Moreno, de Vega, & Leon, 2013; Moreno et al., 2015; van Elk,
van Schie, Zwaan, & Bekkering, 2010). This finding strongly supports the theory of embodiment, which, in the case of language
processing, indicates that understanding linguistic input requires
a mental neural simulation of respective sensorimotor information
in somatosensory and motor areas (Barsalou, 1999, 2008; Gallese &
Lakoff, 2005; Glenberg & Kaschak, 2003; for a review see also
Buccino, Colage, Gobbi, & Bonaccorso, 2016). For instance, Gallese
and Lakoff (2005) suggested that the neural substrates underlying
the processing of perceptive input, action execution, action simulation, action imagery and linguistic comprehension are equal and
that all of these processes require the activation of sensorimotor
circuits. These assumptions are supported by the results of several
fMRI and TMS studies revealing an activation of primary and secondary motor areas during the processing of action verbs
(Boulenger, Hauk, & Pulvermuller, 2009; Desai, Binder, Conant, &
Seidenberg, 2010; Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermuller, 2004;
Tomasino, Fink, Sparing, Dafotakis, & Weiss, 2008). Fischer and
Zwaan (2008) summarized the role of sensorimotor information
for language processing as not being demonstrably necessary for
language comprehension but as allowing for an enhanced understanding of linguistic input.
To compare the processing of action verbs in a human versus an
animal context, van Elk et al. (2010) conducted an EEG experiment,
in which they presented sentences containing concrete noun-verb
pairs to participants (e.g., The athlete jumps over the hurdle. vs. The
deer jumps over the fence.). Their claim was that motor imagery
would be manipulated due to the difference in familiarity between
human and animal actions. Beside an early ERD in the l-range (10-
14 Hz), they observed a desynchronization in the b-band (20-
30 Hz), which occurred in central electrode regions, specifically
over left premotor areas, between 500 and 600 ms post verb onset.
Due to the latencies of the effects, the authors concluded that the
motor activity reflected by l- and b-suppression corresponded to
the retrieval of lexical-semantic information (van Elk et al.,
2010). Moreno et al. (2013) observed both l- (8-13 Hz) and bERDs (15-20 Hz) in fronto-central electrodes over the sensorimotor cortex during action language processing. They compared
power changes during the presentation of action and abstract sentences and during manual action observation. The presentation of

action related stimuli (both verbal and visual) induced significant
power suppression in comparison to abstract language stimuli. In
a second study by Moreno et al. (2015), no b-related (13-20 Hz)
language effect could be observed, whereas l-power (6-13 Hz)
got reduced during action sentence comprehension. However, the
b-range chosen in the second study differed from the range
analyzed in the first study and comprised both b1- and
b2-frequencies. Action related effects in the b-band seem to occur
in higher b-frequencies, though (Pfurtscheller et al., 1996; van
Elk et al., 2010). In sum, a suppression or desynchronization of
b-oscillations related to action verb processing seems to occur later
than comparable l-effects and seems not be detectable over both
b1- and b2-frequencies. Fig. 1 gives an overview of l- and
b-oscillations in response to action, language, and action language
stimuli.
These electrophysiological studies suggested that an activation
of sensorimotor areas is connected to concrete action language
processing. A great number of behavioral and fMRI studies further
supported this assumption (D'Ausilio et al., 2009; Glenberg et al.,
2010; Hauk et al., 2004; Klatzky, Pellegrino, McCloskey, &
Doherty, 1989; Moseley & Pulvermuller, 2014; Pulvermuller,
Shtyrov, & Ilmoniemi, 2005) and partly revealed that processing
abstract action language (e.g., pushing the argument) leads to an
activation of motor areas as well (Desai, Binder, Conant, Mano, &
Seidenberg, 2011; Desai, Conant, Binder, Park, & Seidenberg,
2013; Glenberg et al., 2008; Romero Lauro, Mattavelli, Papagno,
& Tettamanti, 2013; Schaller, Weiss, & Muller, in press; Wilson &
Gibbs, 2007). However, the effects following abstract action language seem to be weaker than those following concrete action language. Schaller et al. (in press) described a stronger motor priming
effect on concrete than on abstract action language stimuli. Participants conducted a sensibility judgment on concrete and abstract
sentences containing action verbs after the execution of a movement, which was either prototypical or unrelated with respect to
the action verb in the sentence. Response times showed that in
comparison to an unprimed condition, the comprehension of concrete action sentences was facilitated after the execution of a prototypical movement only. In contrast, comprehension of the
abstract action sentences was facilitated by both prototypical and
unrelated movements. This effect showed that there are differences between concrete and abstract action language processing
with regard to the degree of the involvement of retrieved motor
representations (Schaller et al., in press).
In the current study, we focused on b-oscillations and their
responsiveness to abstract action language stimuli against the
background of the embodied language theory. If motor representations should be involved in abstract action language processing,
action related b2-oscillations might show a desynchronization during the presentation of respective stimuli. With regard to the differences concerning concrete and abstract action language
processing described by Schaller et al. (in press) we asked the following questions: Do brain oscillations, which are known to be
responsive to action stimuli, differ during the comprehension of
action verbs in concrete vs. abstract contexts? And are these brain
responses comparable to those during action observation? The second question aimed at getting a better idea of whether the degree
to which motor representations are activated during action observation is comparable to that during action language processing. To
answer these questions, we investigated whether b2-oscillations
(16-25 Hz) during the observation of an arm-/hand-related movement would be similar to b2-behavior during the processing of
action verbs embedded in concrete and abstract sentences. As
mentioned before, brain oscillations in the b-range are both related
to motor processes and various aspects of language processing
including the dissociation between concrete and abstract concepts.
Thus, b-range behavior is highly relevant in the current study

looking at both action language and the contrast between action
verbs in concrete and abstract contexts. In short video clips, we
presented prototypical movements for action verbs and compared
respective desynchronization patterns to those during the
presentation of no-movement videos. In a second block, we aurally
presented sentence stimuli that contained the corresponding
action verbs in either a concrete or an abstract context and
compared those to non-action abstract sentences. We expected
b-oscillations to become suppressed during action observation,
which should result in an ERD relative to the still video condition.
We further expected desynchronization effects after the onset of
action-related sentence final verbs but not after abstract control
verbs.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Participants
30 monolingual German students (15 female) of Bielefeld
University aged 20-31 years (M = 24.6, SD = 2.8) participated in
the EEG study. Written informed consent was obtained from participants for publication of this study. All were right-handed with
a mean lateralization quotient of 87.9 (SD = 12.3) according to a
modified version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield,
1971). Four subjects were rejected before the analysis because of
beta-blocker or anticonvulsant medication respectively. All
remaining subjects declared that they did not suffer from auditory

or motor diseases or restrictions that might have influenced their
capability to fulfill the task and had not been under strong medication during two weeks prior to the experiment. Subjects were paid
for their participation.
2.2. Stimuli and design
Two sets of stimuli were used in the EEG study. One set contained sentence stimuli, the other contained video material. The
most important information concerning the stimuli is given below.
Further details are provided in Schaller et al. (in press).
2.2.1. Sentences
197 German sentences were used as verbal stimuli. They were
recorded with a semi-professional speaker in a sound studio. There
were 50 semantically incongruous fillers and 147 critical sentences
in the experiment. The critical stimuli were set up as triplets, comprising a concrete action sentence (e.g., ``Ich habe die Handbremse
gezogen." - I have pulled the hand break.), an abstract action sentence
(e.g., ``Ich habe die Konsequenz gezogen." - I have drawn the
consequence.), and an abstract control sentence (e.g., ``Ich habe die
Konsequenz gefordert." - I have demanded the consequence.).
Sentence structure was the same for every item with the target
verb positioned at the end. Mean durations were 1595.5 ms
(SD = 207 ms) for sentences and 734.9 ms (SD = 129.2 ms) for
verbs. The sentences in each triplet were matched according to
gender of nouns, number of noun syllables and number of verb ;
syllables. The sentences in each category were matched according

98

F. Schaller et al. / Brain & Language 168 (2017) 95-105

to word frequency of nouns and verbs and co-occurrence of nouns
with verbs. Matching stimuli according to these psycholinguistic
criteria left us with only a limited pool of stimuli to draw from.
The cloze-probability of the chosen items was evaluated and
revealed a significant difference between the action stimuli (concrete and abstract) and the abstract control stimuli, with the
cloze-probability of noun-verb pairs in the control sentences being
significantly lower than in the action sentences. The two types of
action sentences did not differ from each other. Due to the limited
amount of possible stimuli, we decided to conduct the experiment
despite the differences in cloze-probability. A possible influence on
the current data is discussed in Section 4 below.
2.2.2. Videos
In total, we presented 58 videos. 29 videos showed an anonymized male model performing non-object-related movements
that were prototypical for the action verbs, which were embedded
in the sentence stimuli. The other 29 videos were used as a baseline. In those stimuli, the model did not execute any movement.
The prototypes were evaluated according to the results of a motion
tracking study, in which subjects listened to non-object-related
action verbs, that is, the action verbs were presented without
any context. They were asked to then spontaneously perform an
arm and/or hand movement matching that verb (Weiss & Muller,
2012b). The evaluation criteria can be found in Schaller et al. (in
press). All videos were 6000 ms long. The mean duration of movements was 5497.4 ms (SD = 554.0 ms). Triggers were time-locked
to the beginning of movements in the action videos and to the
beginning of still baseline videos respectively. The videos were presented in a single block in fully randomized order.
2.3. Procedure
After instructions, participants were seated in a comfortable
armchair about one meter away from a computer screen in an electromagnetically and sound shielded booth. The experiment was
presented via a customized presentation software (Sculptor) running under Ubuntu (vers. 8.04.2). Sentences were fully randomized
and split in three blocks including approximately the same number
of sentences. There was one block of sentences in the beginning of
each session, one in the middle, and one in the end. Videos were
presented in fully randomized order in one block, which occurred
after the first block of sentences for 50% of the subjects and after
the second block of sentences for the other 50%. A third set of stimuli not related to the current study was presented between the
other two sentence blocks.
The sentences were presented aurally. A fixation cross appeared
on the center of the screen 1000 ms before the beginning of each
sentence and stayed on the screen throughout the entire trial. Subjects were instructed that they would not have to stare at the fixation cross all the time but that as soon as it appeared on the
screen they should stop moving their body and eyes, minimize
blinking, and prepare for the sentence to occur. 1000 ms after the
end of each sentence, a beep signaled participants to verbally indicate whether they perceived the stimulus as a sensible sentence or
not. They responded by saying YES if they judged the sentence to
be sensible and by saying NO if they judged it to be nonsense.
Simultaneously with the offset of the beep the fixation cross disappeared. After an ISI of 2000 ms the next trial started.
2000 ms before the onset of each video a fixation cross
appeared on the center of the screen. Participants were told that
they should focus on the cross, stop moving their body and eyes,
and minimize blinking. They were instructed to watch the video,
which was presented in a visual angle of 7.4, and to mentally mirror the presented action themselves or not to mirror an action in
case of the still baseline videos. Parallel to the end of the video,

the fixation cross popped up again and stayed on the screen for
another 2000 ms. After an ISI of 2000 ms the next trial started.
Fig. 2 gives an example of trials in the sentence and the video
condition.
2.4. Recording
Subject's EEG was recorded continuously from 27 active scalp
electrodes mounted in an ActiCap (Brain Products Inc.), following
the 10/20 system with reference at the FCz. The left and right outer
canthi were used to record horizontal eye movements (hEOG). To
record vertical eye movements, one electrode was attached to
the right infraorbital region (vEOG). The signal was amplified
(QuickAmp, Brain Products Inc.) and digitized at a sampling rate
of 1000 Hz. A bandpass filter from 0.5 to 100 Hz and a 50 Hz notch
filter were applied online. The BrainVision Recorder software (version 1.20, Brain Products Inc.) was used for recordings. Impedance
was kept below 5 kX for all channels.
2.5. Data preparation
Data filtering, cleaning, and export was conducted with BrainVision Analyzer (version 2.0.1, Brain Products Inc.). Data of all channels was re-referenced against the mean of two earlobe
electrodes. Semiautomatic artifact rejection was performed so that
eye movements including blinks and abnormal trends became
highlighted automatically but were again checked visually segment by segment, which allowed for a thorough artifact inspection.
The following criteria were applied: the gradient should not exceed
50 lV/ms; the difference between min and max voltage in the analyzed segment should not exceed 200 lV; the amplitude should
not exceed +200 lV or fall below 200 lV; the difference between
min and max voltage in the analyzed segment should not be less
than 0.1 lV. The proportion of data rejected as a consequence of
the semiautomatic artifact rejection in the video condition was
21.8% with 22.5% in the still baseline condition and 21.1% in the
action condition. 17.3% of data got rejected in the sentence trials,
with 18% rejection of concrete action, 18.6% rejection of abstract
action, and 15.3% rejection of abstract control stimuli. These relatively high values can be explained by taking into consideration
that we presented complete sentences with a mean duration of
about 1600 ms. Subjects had difficulties to refrain from blinking
for the entire segment, which lead to a high amount of eye blinks
in the relevant epochs. We applied an additional bandpass filter
from 0.5 Hz to 30 Hz to continuous EEG files.
2.6. ERD analysis
For both the sentence and the video stimuli, we conducted an
ERD analysis for a central electrode cluster (C3, Cz, C4) in a frequency range between 16 and 25 Hz (b2). The chosen electrodes
recorded activity over the hand areas on the motor strip (Moreno
et al., 2013; Pfurtscheller et al., 1996) and were thus most likely
to reflect motor activity during the processing of action stimuli.
Pulvermuller, Mohr, and Schleichert (1999) also reported EEG
activity around these electrodes while their participants perceived
action related verbs and nouns in contrast to nouns with strong
visual associations. The frequency range between 16 and 25 Hz
was chosen due to the outcomes of Pfurtscheller et al. (1996),
who observed the strongest b-ERD in a frequency range between
16 and 28 Hz during self-paced voluntary hand/wrist movements,
and the studies of Moreno et al. (2013), and van Elk et al. (2010).
2.6.1. Sentences
According to the method described by Pfurtscheller and Lopes
da Silva (1999), we first segmented the data in all sentence

Fig. 2. Design of trials. Each trial started with a white fixation cross against a grey background, followed by the sentence or video respectively. In the sentence condition, the
cross stayed on the screen throughout the presentation of the sentence and a successive interval of 1000 ms until a beep (duration 200 ms) signaled participants to make their
sensibility judgment. In the video condition, the cross popped back up after video presentation and stayed on the screen for another 2000 ms. In both conditions there was an
ISI of 2000 ms.

conditions. We analyzed four different time slots: a baseline starting 200 ms and lasting until 0 ms relative to sentence onset, a slot
from 0 ms to +400 ms relative to sentence onset, a slot from 0 to
1000 ms relative to noun onset, and a slot from 0 to 1600 ms relative to verb onset (Fig. 3). During the first and second time slot the
sentences should not show any ERD differences, since the first time
slot represented an interval before sentence onset and the second
slot represented an interval during which all sentences were equal
(I have. . .). We analyzed a time slot relative to the onset of the noun
in order to compare possible ERD effects related to concrete vs.
abstract nouns. The time slot chosen for the analysis of
b2-oscillation behavior during the verb was limited to 1600 ms
due to the design of trials. There was a beep 1000 ms after sentence
offset to signal participants that they might give their answer concerning the sensibility judgment. In the course of the experiment,
we expected a readiness potential to develop a few hundred milliseconds before the beep. Verbs had a mean duration of about
730 ms. If the window chosen for the analysis of the verb would
have been too long, the readiness potential might have been
included in the time slot chosen for the analysis of the verb. We
applied a filter of 16-25 Hz to the segmented epochs and subsequently squared the amplitudes. These power samples were then
averaged over all trials in each condition for each participant.

of the still baseline videos might therefore have led to significant
differences between the two video conditions especially in the first
100-200 ms, which could only be interpreted as effects based on
the onset of a visual stimulus in the still condition. Subsequently,
the same method as for the sentence trials was used.

2.6.2. Videos
The data in the action condition was segmented in epochs from
200 to +1600 ms relative to the onset of actions in the videos.
Segments of +200 to 2000 ms relative to the onset of videos were
chosen in the still baseline condition. We chose a different time
window here because the mean onset time for actions in the action
videos was 1450.4 ms post video onset. A comparison to the onset

The mean power did not differ significantly between the three
sentence types during neither the baseline nor the sentence onset
epochs. Further, the analysis of concrete vs. abstract nouns did not
show any significant differences between the two noun types. For
the interval between 1200 ms and 1400 ms after verb onset the
Friedman statistics revealed b2-desynchronization for concrete
action and abstract action stimuli in comparison to the abstract

2.7. Statistical analysis
Area mean amplitudes were calculated for each electrode in
sequential windows of 200 ms in the selected epochs. Amplitudes
were averaged over the relevant electrodes for each sentence and
video type in each time window. Since in most of the time slots
the data was not normally distributed, we conducted non parametric statistical testing (Field, 2009). In the sentence condition, the
three sentence types concrete action, abstract action, and abstract
were analyzed in Friedman-tests. In case of significant results,
post-hoc Wilcoxon-tests were used. Concrete and abstract nouns
as well as the two video types action and still were compared by
means of Wilcoxon-tests.
3. Results

items, v2(2) = 7.923, p < 0.05. As shown by post-hoc pairwise comparisons, the mean power during both concrete action and abstract
action stimulus processing was significantly lower than the mean
power during abstract item processing. The respective results are
z = 2.679, p < 0.01 one-sided for the comparison of concrete action
and abstract items and z = 1.918, p < 0.05 one-sided for the comparison of abstract action and abstract items. For the subsequent
time slot between 1400 and 1600 ms post verb onset, the
Friedman-test was significant as well with v2(2) = 11.077,
p < 0.01. The mean power during the processing of abstract action
items was significantly lower than during the processing of concrete action items, z = 2.400, p < 0.01 one-sided. Further, and of
more interest for the current study, the comparison between
abstract action and abstract stimuli revealed a significant effect
with the power during abstract action verb processing being lower
than during abstract verb processing, z = 1.892, p < 0.05 onesided. More values concerning the test results may be found in
Table 1. Figs. 4 and 5 show the course of b2-power during the processing of the three sentence types.
3.2. Videos
Whereas there was no significant effect concerning power differences between action and still videos during the baseline, results
showed clear b2-desynchronization while participants watched
videos showing actions in comparison to the still video condition.
The mean power values during action observation were significantly lower than the values during the observation of a still video.
This effect started 400 ms after action onset and lasted throughout

the two video conditions can be found in Table 1. Fig. 6 displays

4. Discussion
In the current study, we compared electrophysiological brain
responses during action observation and the processing of action
verbs in concrete and abstract contexts. We analyzed b2-rhythm
behavior as these oscillations have repeatedly been reported to
be strongly related to neural sensorimotor processes. EEG
responses on action observation compared to a still video baseline
revealed an action related b2-suppression between 400 and
1600 ms post action onset, which was present in a central electrode cluster. The processing of action related sentences containing
action verbs in either a concrete or an abstract context elicited a
comparatively late effect, starting about 1200 ms post action verb
onset. However, mean power during action verb processing in both
contexts was significantly more negative than in the abstract control condition.
Our findings concerning b2-suppression during action observation are in line with previous studies reporting the same effects
during both action observation and imagery. McFarland et al.
(2000) analyzed l- (8-12 Hz) and b-suppression (18-25 Hz) while
participants either repeatedly opened and closed their hand or
imagined doing so. They reported similar oscillation patterns for
the two conditions, that is, a desynchronization during action execution and action imagery in both frequency bands. The effect in

the l-range was most prominent at lateral postcentral electrodes.
b-range ERD showed a rather diffuse pattern with its focus at the
vertex. In an MEG study by De Lange, Jensen, Bauer, and Toni
(2008), participants had to indicate whether a line drawing of a
hand varying in its rotation displays a left or a right hand. This task
was supposed to elicit mental motor imagery and simulation. The
authors observed strong l- (8-12 Hz) and b-suppression (16-
24 Hz) over parieto-occipital and precentral sensors. Action observation was analyzed by Moreno et al. (2013) and Simon and
Mukamel (2016). In both studies, l- and b-ERD could be observed
while participants were watching videos of hand movements. An
interesting observation by Quandt and Marshall (2014) was that
if participants gained sensorimotor experience with objects, the
intensity of l- and b-suppression was stronger when watching
the same objects being manipulated in a video recording than if

participants did not have the chance to gain sensorimotor information about the objects. This is in line with the results reported by
Jarvelainen et al. (2004) that motor-related brain oscillation patterns might be sensitive to the experience participants obtained
with the relevant objects. In the current study, we found b2-ERD
over central electrodes during the observation of prototypical
actions, which further supports the assumption that action
observation leads to the activation of motor representations and
possibly elicits action simulation processes.
The current results showed no b2-related differences during the
processing of concrete vs. abstract nouns. Oscillations in the
b-range have previously been described as being sensitive towards
the concrete-abstract distinction. For instance, Weiss and Muller
(2013) described stronger mean coherence during the processing
of concrete compared to abstract sentences in theta (3-7 Hz) and

102

F. Schaller et al. / Brain & Language 168 (2017) 95-105

b1-frequencies (13-18 Hz). Weiss and Rappelsberger (1996) compared concrete to abstract nouns and reported differences related
to intra- and interhemispheric coherence changes in b1frequencies between the two word types. Here, we analyzed b2oscillations in response to concrete vs. abstract nouns. There are
several possible reasons for why we could not see any difference
effects between the two noun types. First, possible effects might
have been covered by verb comprehension processes. Nouns in
the current study had a mean duration of about 434 ms. The analyzed interval of 1000 ms post noun onset thus overlapped with
the onset of subsequently presented verbs for a mean duration of
566 ms. Second, the results of earlier studies showed effects in
b1- and not in b2-frequencies. Possibly, b2-oscillations are not as
sensitive towards the concrete-abstract distinction as b1oscillations. Third, we only analyzed a central electrode cluster
over the motor strip, which might not have been large enough to
reflect possible power differences between concrete and abstract
nouns in the analyzed frequency range. Thus, in order to find out
about a possible sensitivity of b2-oscillations towards the
concrete-abstract distinction, a study specifically focused on that
question could lead to more informative results.
Possibly, the difference in the cloze-probability between the
sentences needs to be considered as a caveat when interpreting
the current data since it might have influenced the results. According to van Elk et al. (2010), effects of cloze-probability might influence b-ERD in a frequency range between 20 and 30 Hz in the time
interval of the N400. They detected that b-ERD was stronger for
noun-verb pairs with a high cloze-probability. Hence, if the
cloze-probability of the sentences would have influenced b-ERD
in the current study, the effects should have been stronger for
the action sentences than the abstract control sentences in the
N400 time window, which we did not observe. Further, the
sentence-related effects observed here resemble those during
action observation, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms
are similar. Although it is, therefore, considered unlikely, an influence of the differences concerning the cloze-probability of the
noun-verb pairs in the stimuli used here cannot be completely
ruled out. A partial replication of the current study, in which the
cloze-probability between other different sentence types is
matched, might serve the robustness of the current effects.
The main focus of the current study was on the comparison of
meaning constitution processes related to action verbs in concrete
and abstract contexts. Compared to abstract control sentences not
containing action verbs, we observed significantly lower power
values in the b2-frequency range for action verbs in both concrete
and abstract contexts. The onset of this effect was 1200 ms post
verb onset and about 465 ms after mean verb offset. This latency
appears to be quite high, especially when taking the suggestions
by Pulvermuller, Shtyrov, and Hauk (2009) into account. They discussed the possibility of an almost simultaneous access to all cognitive information related to a linguistic sign. According to them,
this access should take place between 100 and 250 ms after stimulus onset. However, they further discuss that later EEG components might either reflect a second comprehension step or postcomprehension processes (Pulvermuller et al., 2009). In studies
by Pulvermuller, Harle, and Hummel (2001) and Klepp, Niccolai,
Buccino, Schnitzler, and Biermann-Ruben (2015), effects concerning brain responses to action language stimuli were also reported
as early as 250 ms and 400-600 ms post action verb onset. It needs
to be taken into account, though, that these studies firstly presented single action verbs not embedded in a sentence context.
The activation of sensorimotor areas might occur later if action
verbs are presented as part of a sentence since the allover comprehension time is prolonged. Secondly, Pulvermuller et al. (2001) did
not analyze a specific frequency range but focused on ERP differences between electrodes. Thirdly, only the study by Klepp et al.

(2015) used abstract verbs as a comparative condition. These
methodological differences need to be considered when comparing
the current results to those of earlier studies. Here, in relation to
the ERD detected during action observation, the onset of the verb
effect was rather late but could still be interpreted as a late ERD.
One reason for the effect occurring rather late might be the frequency range chosen for the analysis in the current study. As
Pfurtscheller et al. (1996) discussed, they observed the strongest
b-ERD in a frequency range between 16 and 28 Hz during selfpaced voluntary hand/wrist movements. This is about the frequency range we chose for the current analysis. It might be possible, though, that a more fine-grained approach and an analysis of
smaller frequency steps might result in the current effects becoming more prominent. However, a combined ERP and spectral analysis conducted by Pulvermuller, Lutzenberger, and Preissl (1999)
indicated a rather late responsiveness of EEG oscillations between
25 and 35 Hz to action verbs as well. They presented concrete
nouns and action verbs to participants and focused on comparing
ERD and spectral differences in occipital and central electrode sites.
Whereas the ERP analysis revealed a significant word class effect
between the two electrode sites as early as 200-230 ms post stimulus onset, the spectral analysis showed a significant interaction
between the regions of interest and word class around 30 Hz in a
later time window between 500 and 800 ms post stimulus onset.
In this interval, Pulvermuller, Lutzenberger, et al. (1999) reported
enhanced activity at central sites following action verb compared
to noun presentation. The authors discussed that this late difference in higher frequencies might go back on active memory processes. After the activation of cell assemblies induced by
stimulus presentation, which is visible as an early ERP, this activity
might sustain and show as a change in high-frequency responses
(Pulvermuller, Lutzenberger, et al., 1999). In the context of the data
presented here, this might indicate that the late effects are not
directly linked to language processing but rather to active memory
processes in motor areas. It is, however, interesting that these processes occurred for action verbs in both concrete and abstract contexts but not for abstract verbs. Note that participants were asked
to perform different tasks in the two experimental blocks. While
watching the action videos, they were instructed to actively imagine executing the actions themselves. When listening to the sentences, they were supposed to perform a sensibility judgment
task. Possibly, shifting participants' focus from imagining executing the perceived action to the sensibility of the sentence content
caused a higher latency until the onset of oscillatory patterns
related to sensorimotor processes. Further, whereas the actions
in the videos were performed without any object being present,
the context of the sentences suggested object-related actions,
which is another criterion possibly causing the difference in the
onset latencies between the two tasks. Incidentally, the late onset
of the effect may be relativized. Note that we presented sentences
in the present perfect (German Perfekt) with the verb at the sentences' final position. Several studies suggested a syntactic complexity effect, describing that comprehension processes take
more time in correlation with an increase of syntactic complexity
(Carpenter, Miyake, & Just, 1995; Ferreira, 1991; King & Just,
1991; Schriefers, Friederici, & Kuhn, 1995; Wingfield, Peelle, &
Grossman, 2003). Ferreira (1991) asked participants to memorize
sentences which differed in syntactic complexity, defined as the
number of nodes in a phrase structure tree. The initiation time of
participants' response increased with an increase of syntactic complexity (Ferreira, 1991). King and Just (1991) contrasted subjectrelative (The reporter that attacked the senator admitted the error
publicly after the hearing.) to object-relative clauses (The reporter
that the senator attacked admitted the error publicly after the hearing.) in a Reading Span task. Reading times were prolonged for
object-relative in comparison to subject-relative sentences inde-

F. Schaller et al. / Brain & Language 168 (2017) 95-105

pendently of the reading span capacity of subjects. Syntactic structure in the current study was more complex than in studies presenting single words or sentences in the present tense, which
might have caused a comparably late access to the meaning of
the sentence final action verb. Further, one needs to consider the
uniqueness point (UP) of the verbs. In the cohort model, the UP
is defined as the point at which sufficient phonetic information
of a word is available to identify the word (Marslen-Wilson,
1987). In the current experiment, the UP of the verb was prolonged
due to final verbs being presented as participles, thus starting with
a prefix (e.g., ge-), which did not give any information about the
content of the verb. This very short prefix had a mean duration
of about 110 ms. Given that the mean duration of the final verbs
was 735 ms and that they comprised three syllables on average,
the mean duration of syllables except for the prefix was about
310 ms. Assuming that the UP of the verbs would be somewhere
after the end of the second syllable, we suggest it to be about
450 ms post final verb onset in the current study. Accordingly,
the latency from the current UP until the onset of the observed
desynchronization was about 750 ms, which relativizes the lateness of the effect.
To our knowledge, there have only been two studies focusing on
b-suppression during action language processing so far. van Elk
et al. (2010) reported b-ERD during action verb processing in a frequency range between 20 and 30 Hz with a latency of 500 ms.
However, they did not compare ERD effects in comparison to a
neutral non-action baseline, as was done in the current study.
The approach by Moreno et al. (2013) is more comparable to the
material and analysis used here, since concrete action sentences
were contrasted with abstract sentences. They analyzed l- and
b-power during verb processing by means of an FFT-analysis. In
contrast to the current method, they chose segments with a length
of 2 s. No accurate information on the latency of the effect in the
b-range could be gained. The current study thus provides information on the latency of b-ERD during action verb processing
compared to a neutral non-action baseline for the first time. Nevertheless, it needs to be considered that the effect might not reflect
processes of meaning constitution but that it rather is an indicator
of motor imagery or simulation processes triggered by action verb
comprehension. Thus, the observed effect would not go back on
motor representations being activated due to semantic processing
of the sentence but rather due to simulation processes evoked as
an after-effect of semantic processing. However, in a study by
Andres, Finocchiaro, Buiatti, and Piazza (2015) the design allowed
to assign the data to different stages of semantic decoding. Their
results indicated that motor related electrophysiological brain
responses on linguistic action stimuli are indeed related to semantic processing. Further, it needs to be highlighted that the similarity regarding b2-ERD as a response to action observation and to
action language processing is limited concerning both the latency
and the magnitude of the effect. This might indicate that motor
representations are involved in action language processing only
to a limited degree.
Given that the observed b-ERD is interpreted as an indicator of
motor involvement in action language processing, this effect is in
line with results of a current behavioral study by Schaller et al.
(in press). They observed a cross-modal priming effect of prototypical actions on action verb comprehension in concrete and abstract
contexts. Participants executed action prototypes for certain action
verbs or actions that were unrelated to the action verbs and subsequently listened to the same sentences that were presented in the
current study. Thus, sentence stimuli either contained the corresponding action verb in a concrete or an abstract context. Response
times were collected by means of a sensibility judgment. The
authors reported that participants were faster to respond to concrete action sentences (I have pulled the hand break.) after the exe-

103

cution of a prototypical action than after the execution of an
unrelated movement. For the abstract action sentences (I have
drawn the consequence.), the execution of both related and unrelated actions caused a facilitation effect. These results are interpreted as indicating differences in the degree or quality of the
involvement of the retrieved motor representations in action verb
comprehension in concrete compared to abstract contexts.
Whereas action verbs in literal sentences might elicit a very
detailed motor representation, the comprehension of action verbs
in abstract sentences might be related to a rather broad motor representation (Schaller et al., in press).
An alternative explanation for the ERD-differences between
action and abstract sentence-final verbs might be that participants
responded by giving a verbal answer. As Borghi and Zarcone (2016)
reported, processing abstract words elicited activation of the
mouth area, whereas concrete words activated sensorimotor representations in their behavioral study. They compared responses
on concrete and abstract words primed by a concrete or an abstract
word definition in terms of a go-nogo paradigm. Improper combinations of definitions and words did not require a response by participants, whereas appropriate combinations required them to
press a button. In one experimental block they pressed the button
with their hand, in a second block they used their teeth. Borghi and
Zarcone (2016) reported a general advantage of hand over mouth
responses. However, this advantage was less prominent for
responses following abstract than concrete target words. This finding is in line with previous results by Scorolli et al. (2011), who
postulated that abstract concepts might be processed stronger in
language areas whereas concrete words might rely more on the
sensorimotor system. Against the background of these results,
the difference in b-ERD modulation observed between abstract
and action words in the current study might be due to the interaction of the mouth area activated during abstract verb processing
and the verbal response. Several aspects speak against such an
interpretation. First, after verb offset there was a silent interval
of 1000 ms, then a tonal signal of 200 ms and the verbal response
was required only thereafter. Since the ERD-effect occurred about
465 ms after verb offset, more than 700 ms passed between the
effect and the verbal response. Second, independently of a possible
interaction of abstract verbs and the verbal response, action verbs
in abstract contexts were similar to those in concrete contexts,
which is what we were focusing on in the current study. Third,
the ERD-effect matches the behavioral results of Schaller et al.
(in press), in which response times on abstract sentences containing action verbs were influenced by preceding action execution
whereas response times on abstract control stimuli were not.
Taken together, these arguments speak against the assumption
that the verbal response had an influence on the effects observed
here.
Our current findings are further in accordance with results of
other studies proposing a gradual involvement of motor representations in abstract action language processing (Desai et al., 2011,
2013; Romero Lauro et al., 2013; Sakreida et al., 2013; Troyer,
Curley, Miller, Saygin, & Bergen, 2014). Desai et al. (2011) compared brain activation patterns in response to arm/hand related
action verbs, which were embedded in literal and metaphoric contexts. They found that both sentence types elicited activation in the
anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL) in the left hemisphere to the
same degree. During the processing of metaphoric action stimuli,
an activation of the right aIPL in addition to other areas related
to abstract language processing was observed. They further
reported that the involvement of sensorimotor areas in action
metaphor comprehension is gradual, with a stronger involvement
during the comprehension of more unfamiliar metaphors. In a later
study, Desai et al. (2013) added idiomatic action sentences to the
stimulus set used in the previous study. They observed activation

104

F. Schaller et al. / Brain & Language 168 (2017) 95-105

in secondary motor areas in the IPL, small activation clusters in primary motor cortex and in temporal regions for both literal and
metaphoric stimuli but not for idiomatic sentences, which further
supported the idea of a gradual involvement. In an fMRI study by
Romero Lauro et al. (2013), similar results were obtained, supporting the view that the involvement of motor areas in action language processing is gradual, ranging from strong in literal stimuli
to weak or no involvement in idiomatic sentences (Romero Lauro
et al., 2013). Alternatively, it has been suggested that concrete
and abstract concepts both rely on sensorimotor systems but
beyond that abstract words evoke more emotional and linguistic
representations (Borghi, Capirci, Gianfreda, & Volterra, 2014;
Scorolli et al., 2012).
An interesting finding in the current study was that the ERD
during abstract action verb processing compared to the abstract
control condition was detectable over a time interval of 400 ms,
that is, between 1200 and 1600 ms post action verb onset. In contrast, the ERD during concrete action verb processing was present
between 1200 and 1400 ms post action verb onset only. These
results speak in favor of the assumption that motor representations are retrieved to a different degree or in a different manner
during abstract compared to concrete action verb processing. We
would not interpret the sustained abstract action effect as an indicator of a stronger involvement of motor representations in
abstract than in concrete action verb processing. Rather, the integration of motor information in the abstract context takes more
time than in the concrete context. This might be because only some
of the motor information expressed by the action verb is relevant
for decoding the meaning of the abstract action sentence. This relevant motor information needs to be selected and transferred on
an abstract level of meaning. For instance, when processing the
sentence ``I have drawn the consequence.", relevant motor information to comprehend the meaning of the abstract sentence might be
the force of drawing, which can be quite strong, or the direction of
the movement, which represents that the act of drawing affects the
person who is drawing (e.g., object might be easier to see/grasp/
handle). The sustained b-ERD during abstract action verb processing probably reflects the higher effort needed for the selection and
integration of the relevant motor information into the abstract
context. Thus, our current results support the assumption of a
gradual involvement of motor representations in action language
processing. Probably all of the sensorimotor information of an
action is relevant and therefore accessed during the process of
meaning constitution of action verbs in concrete contexts. In contrast, if the meaning of an abstract action sentence is generated,
only parts of the sensorimotor information connected to an action
is relevant.

5. Conclusion
In the current study we analyzed oscillations in the b2-range
(16-25 Hz) of the human EEG in response to action observation
as well as concrete and abstract action language processing against
the background of the embodied language theory. Findings of previous studies suggested that b2-oscillations might be sensitive to
action language but did not reveal any precise temporal information regarding the onset of respective effects. Here, we found b2desynchronization in response to the presentation of action verbs
embedded in concrete and abstract contexts. This effect occurred
about 450 ms post mean action verb offset and speaks in favor of
motor representations being involved in the process of meaning
constitution not only during concrete but also during abstract
action language. The current results thus provide information on
the latency of b-ERD during action verb processing compared to
a neutral non-action baseline for the first time. Further, they sup-

port the assumption that the involvement of motor representations in language processing is gradual, which is in accordance
with findings from other recent studies.
