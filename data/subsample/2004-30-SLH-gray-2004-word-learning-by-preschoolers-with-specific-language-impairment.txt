With Specific Language
Impairment: Predictors and
Poor Learners

Twenty preschoolers with specific language impairment (SLI) and 20 age matches
with normal language (NL) participated in a study to determine whether phonological memory or semantic knowledge predicted word-learning success. Poor
learners' performance was analyzed to investigate whether phonology or
semantics contributed more to word-learning difficulty. Results suggest that
existing lexical knowledge, as measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test
(PPVT-III), and fast-mapping ability hold promise for identifying poor word
learners, but individual PPVT-III scores must be compared with SLI group scores.
Poor word learners comprehended most new words and showed sufficient
semantic knowledge of their referents to draw them but had difficulty producing
the words. Findings indicated that both semantics and phonology contribute to
word-learning difficulty, with word production presenting the biggest hindrance to
success.

exical acquisition is a critical component of children's language and
literacy growth and presents a formidable challenge for children
with specific language impairment (SLI; e.g., Dollaghan, 1987; Ellis
Weismer & Hesketh, 1993, 1996, 1998; Gray, 2003b; Kiernan & Gray
1998; Rice, Buhr, & Oetting, 1992; Rice, Oetting, Marquis, Bode, & Pae,
1994). Although we know that many children with SLI demonstrate poor
lexical acquisition relative to age-matched peers with normal language
(NL), less is known about the specific problems they encounter and how
we might identify these children.
Experimental word-learning studies of children with SLI generally
fall into three categories: fast mapping, quick incidental learning, and
supported learning contexts. Fast mapping kicks off the word-learning
process when a child encounters a word for the first time and stores
sufficient phonological, semantic, syntactic, and nonverbal information
so that future exposures to the word elaborate its stored representation.
Children who have difficulty fast mapping might also have difficulty
with other aspects of word learning; therefore, researchers have investigated whether fast mapping is problematic for children with SLI. In two
fast-mapping studies where preschoolers were presented with three and
four new words, respectively, Dollaghan (1987) and Gray (2003b) found

comparable comprehension performance between SLI
and NL groups. Dollaghan found that children with SLI
produced fewer of the words' phonemes than did children with NL, but Gray found no between-group differences for production. Regarding the relationship between
fast mapping and word learning, Gray also found that
fast-mapping comprehension and production accounted
for a significant amount of word-learning variance (15%-
22%) for both SLI and NL groups.
Rice and colleagues (Rice, Buhr, & Nemeth, 1990;
Rice et al., 1992, 1994) used a quick incidental learning
(QUIL) paradigm to study word learning by preschool
children with SLI in comparison with children with NL
matched on age and matched on mean length of utterance (younger children). QUIL differs from fast mapping in that fast mapping refers to the rapid initial phase
of word learning (Carey, 1978), but QUIL differentiates
between the quickness of word learning and the incidental nature of the environmental support for learning. In QUIL studies, unlike fast-mapping studies, children receive no prompting from adults to attend to new
words (Oetting, Rice, & Swank, 1995). Rice et al.'s QUIL
procedure presented 8 (Rice et al., 1990, 1992) or 10 (Rice
et al., 1994) target words in a video during a single experimental session. The SLI group had difficulty comprehending new words when provided with a limited
number of exposures but comprehended new words as
well as age-matched peers with NL when provided with
more exposures. Production was not assessed.
Three studies by Ellis Weismer and Hesketh (1993,
1996, 1998) used direct teaching to investigate whether
input variables affected word-learning performance for
three novel words. No between-group differences were
found for comprehension or production on five of six
learning measures in Ellis Weismer and Hesketh (1993),
with both groups showing similar responses to changes
in speaking rate, stress, and visual cues when learning
new words. In Ellis Weismer and Hesketh (1996), the
SLI group comprehended and produced significantly
fewer words than an age-matched NL group but did not
differ from a vocabulary-matched group except that they
demonstrated poorer production of words trained at fast
speaking rates. In Ellis Weismer and Hesketh's (1998)
study, the SLI group understood and produced significantly fewer novel words than did the age-matched NL
group, but there were no significant differences between
the SLI and younger, vocabulary-matched group.
Kiernan and Gray (1998) and Gray (2003b) investigated word learning by preschool children with SLI relative to age-matched peers with NL in a supported learning context (SLC). Similar to language therapy during
play, the SLC provided repeated models of new words in
sessions over several days, specific references to the
words, feedback to the child about accuracy of response,

1118

and ongoing adult-child interaction. Children were
asked to imitate and to produce the words. In both studies, the NL group learned to comprehend and produce
significantly more words than did the SLI group. Gray
(2003b) also assessed learning rate. The NL group required fewer trials to learn to comprehend and to produce a word than did the SLI group.
Each of these studies compared group performance
as children mapped the referential meaning for words.
Although the NL group often outperformed the SLI
group, it is not clear what proportion of children with
SLI had difficulty or whether they experienced different kinds of learning problems.
Discussions about the causes of word-learning problems experienced by children with SLI have focused
primarily on phonological memory or semantic deficits.
In their research with children diagnosed with SLI,
Gathercole and Baddeley (1990) concluded that there
was a causal connection between poor phonological shortterm memory and poor vocabulary acquisition. According to this account, the phonological loop provides temporary storage of unfamiliar phonological forms while
more permanent memory representations are being constructed. Children with SLI are poorer than peers on
short-term memory tasks (Bishop, North, & Donlan,
1996; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Edwards & Lahey,
1998; Ellis Weismer et al., 2000; Gathercole & Baddeley,
1990; Gray, 2003a); thus, short-term memory is implicated in their poor lexical acquisition.
It is not clear how phonological memory deficits interface with semantic knowledge, but it is clear that
children with SLI may demonstrate limited semantic
knowledge that negatively affects their naming performance and thus their ability to produce words. In recent studies involving object words, Lahey and Edwards
(1999) and McGregor, Newman, Reilly, and Capone
(2002) reported that children with SLI ranging in age
from 4 years 3 months (4;3) to 9;7 made more naming
errors than their NL peers, with semantic association
errors constituting the primary error type. Lahey and
Edwards posited that the semantic association errors
children made were the result of poorly differentiated
and perhaps poorly organized semantic representations.
McGregor et al. proposed that most naming errors were
associated with limited semantic representation.
How might these deficits affect word learning? There
is general agreement that the lexical system includes at
least three levels: the conceptual level, the lemma level
with semantically and syntactically specified information, and the lexeme level with phonologically represented specifications (e.g., Caramazza, 1997). If children
with SLI have difficulty establishing semantic representations at the lemma level, as suggested by naming research, their missing or sparse semantic representations

of new words may be insufficient to permit comprehension or production of the word. If children with SLI have
limitations in the quality or quantity of phonological
information held in short-term memory, as suggested
by Gathercole and Baddeley (1990), they would have
difficulty creating a stable phonological representation
of new words at the lexeme level, also interfering with
comprehension or production of new words.
Given the heterogeneity of children diagnosed with
SLI and the nature of word learning, it is likely that
both phonological and semantic deficits contribute to
poor word learning, but this has not been investigated.
It is also the case that some children with SLI perform
as well as their age-matched peers in experimental wordlearning studies and on vocabulary tests (Gray, 2003b;
Gray, Plante, Vance, & Henrichsen, 1999; Kiernan &
Gray, 1998). It would benefit clinicians and researchers
to understand how these successful children differ from
their peers who have much more difficulty learning
words. This requires a detailed examination of the wordlearning process. To accurately identify children likely
to demonstrate word-learning problems, it is also important to discover what predicts word-learning success.
The first purpose of this study was to determine
whether phonological memory or semantic knowledge
tasks predicted word-learning success and whether performance on these measures helped to identify poor
learners. Phonological memory measures included
Dollaghan and Campbell's (1998) nonword repetition task
(NWRT) and a digit span task. To evaluate children's
semantic knowledge of common objects, we developed a
task that required children to spontaneously name and
draw two exemplars from the categories of "balls," "vegetables," "tools," "vehicles," and "clothing" and to name
and recognize pictures of 10 exemplars from those same
categories.
The second purpose of this study was to identify
children who were poor word learners relative to their
peers and to investigate whether phonology or semantics
contributed to their word-learning problems. Children's
phonological and semantic information about new words
was assessed using comprehension and production
probes as they learned. This provided a window into
individual children's learning and a method to assess
learning rate. Comprehension, recognition, and production probes at the end of the study provided a means of
quantifying learning using a method similar to standardized vocabulary tests. These probes were administered when all children had received equal learning
opportunities for each word. Of these two types of measures, we considered the learning probes to be a more
stringent measure of learning than the posttest because
they measured consistency of performance across time.
Finally, a drawing task adapted from McGregor and

Appel (2002) provided a method to assess the change in
children's semantic knowledge of the words from the
beginning to the end of the study.

Participants
Twenty children diagnosed with SLI and 20 children with NL participated in the study. Each child in
the NL group was selected to match a child in the SLI
group for gender and age (3 months). All children were
between the ages of 4;0 and 5;11 and, according to parent report, spoke English as their primary language.
Table 1 contains descriptive information about both
groups. Of the 20 children in the SLI group, 1 was African American, 5 were Hispanic, 1 was other, 3 specified
no ethnicity, and 10 were White. In the NL group, 3 were
African American, 1 was Asian, 1 was Native American,
5 were Hispanic, and 10 were White.

To qualify for inclusion in the study, children with
SLI were required to be enrolled in language therapy.
To qualify for therapy, children needed to score more
than 1.5 SD below the mean on two norm-referenced
language tests. Certified speech-language pathologists
confirmed their diagnosis by applying exclusionary criteria required for a diagnosis of SLI. This selection process results in a heterogeneous participant group but
allows for generalization of findings to the population of
children with SLI whom speech-language pathologists
serve on their treatment caseloads.
Children in the SLI group were recruited from public school and clinic programs. A certified speech-language pathologist determined that each child classified
as SLI met the following selection criteria:
1.

Hearing within normal limits bilaterally (25 dB HL)
at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz (American National Standards Institute [ANSI], 1989).

2.

Normal nonverbal intelligence, as indicated by a
standard score of 75 or above on the Nonverbal scale
of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children
(K-ABC; Kaufman & Kaufman, 1983).

3.

With the exception of language, articulation, or phonological problems, no evidence of a frank neurological problem or additional developmental disorders reported by the parent.

4.

Speech intelligibility judged to be adequate for applying scoring procedures.

A speech-language pathologist determined that
each child classified as NL met the following selection
criteria:
1.

Hearing within normal limits bilaterally (30 dB HL)
at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz bilaterally (ANSI, 1989; a screening level of 30 HZ was
required because of ambient noise in some screening locations).

2.

Normal nonverbal intelligence, as indicated by a
standard score of 75 or above on the Nonverbal scale
of the K-ABC (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1983).

3.

Age-expected progress in school, as reported by
teacher.

4.

Normal motor, cognitive, socioemotional, speech,
and language development, as reported by parents
and teacher.

Additional norm-referenced speech and language
tests were administered to further describe the speech
and language skills of participants. Mean test scores are
reported in Table 1. One child from the NL group and 9
children from the SLI group scored more than 1 SD
below the normative mean on the Bankson-Bernthal
Test of Phonology (BBTOP; Bankson & Bernthal, 1990).
These children demonstrated a variety of phonological
1120

patterns and articulation errors that did not prevent
accurate scoring of responses to experimental tasks. No
children were excluded from the study due to lack of
intelligibility.

Experimental Tasks
Phonological memory tasks. The NWRT developed
by Dollaghan and Campbell (1998) was administered to
assess phonological memory. Nonwords were presented
to children via computer over headphones. Children's
repetitions were recorded into WAV computer files or on
audiotape via microphone. Research assistants (RAs)
scored each nonword production live. To be credited
with correct repetition during live scoring, children
were required to repeat the nonword exactly. Later,
when listening to the recorded responses and tallying
the score, the RAs rescored an incorrect production as
correct if the error was due to a phoneme substitution
(e.g., /t/ for /k/) that was also demonstrated consistently
on the BBTOP. Each correct response scored 1 point.
Mean group scores are reported in Table 2. A second
RA scored 10 samples (5 NL, 5 SLI) selected at random. Point-to-point agreement between the two coders
was 94% (range = 85%-100%).
A digit span task was also administered. Numbers
from 1 to 9 were randomly selected without replacement
to form lists varying from three to nine numbers in
length. Two lists were presented at each length, beginning with three digits. Presentation was via computer
using headphones. Children's repetitions were recorded
into WAV computer files or on audiotape. RAs scored
each digit span repetition live. To be credited with correct repetition, children were required to repeat each
number of the series in the correct order. Each correct
repetition of a series scored 1 point. The task continued
until the child failed to repeat either series of numbers

at the same span length. Mean groups scores are reported in Table 2. A second RA scored 10 samples (5 NL,
5 SLI) selected at random. Point-to-point agreement
between the two coders was 98% (range = 87.5%-100%).
Semantic drawing and spontaneous naming tasks.
These tasks required children to draw two exemplars
each from the categories of "fruit," "balls," "vegetables,"
"tools," "vehicles," and "clothing" and to spontaneously
name what they drew. If the child did not spontaneously
name what they were drawing, the RA asked, "What
did you draw?" The RA wrote the child's responses and
any comments the child made about the drawing on a
separate data sheet. Each spontaneous name produced
by the child that was an exemplar of the target category
scored 1 point, with 12 total points possible for the spontaneous naming task. Mean group scores are reported
in Table 2.
Three adult raters independently scored each child's
drawings one at a time. Following the procedure developed by McGregor and Appel (2002), raters were given
a data sheet and instructed to circle the number corresponding to their level of agreement with the following
statement, "This preschool-age child's drawing shows
an accurate and complete knowledge of X." The scale
ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
To facilitate scoring, each drawing was labeled with the
statement, "The child called this drawing a/an X" (e.g.,
apple). Mean group scores are reported in Table 2. Interrater agreement was high. The standard deviation for
the three raters' scores for a fruit drawing was calculated for each child. The mean standard deviation for
these drawing ratings was 0.67 (range = 0-2.64).
Semantic vocabulary task. This task required children to name and to recognize pictures of 10 exemplars
from the same categories used in the spontaneous naming and drawing tasks. This task was always administered after the semantic drawing task. The naming portion was always administered first. One point was
awarded for each correct naming and recognition response, resulting in 50 possible points for each task.
The mean group scores for these tasks are reported in
Table 2.

Word-Learning Materials
Target and common objects. Target objects were selected by asking 10 adults to view a variety of craft
and hardware items. Objects they did not consistently
name and those that evoked the same name from each
adult were selected for further review. Next, the objects were shown to six 5-year-old children with NL
who were not included in this study. Two objects that
evoked the same name from every child and two that
were never named correctly were selected for this study.

Four objects were chosen because Kiernan and Gray
(1998) had indicated that the NL group could learn three
words in 5 days, but the SLI group learned an average
of two. Selected objects included a wood peg, an electrical connector, a small decorative bird, and a silk flower.
Additional common objects (i.e., plastic knife, rock, plastic horse, and plastic box) that children could readily
name were also used in the study. Pilot studies indicated that children were more likely to try to name target objects when they could successfully name other
objects.
Target words. The target words that children learned
to use as names for the target objects were /t" nEt/, /i
nEs/, /ho kEm/, and /fI zEk/. They were chosen from a list of
two-syllable, consonant, vowel, consonant, vowel, consonant (CVCVC) English words pronounced with stress on
the first syllable. Because of their low incidence in spoken English (Hall, Nagy, & Linn, 1984), the words were
assumed to be unfamiliar to preschool children.

General Procedure
The study progression is illustrated in the Appendix. The fast-mapping task was administered on Day 1,
and the word-learning task was administered on Days
2 through 5. Phases were used to ensure that RAs provided an equal number of models and probes for each
word before progressing to the next set of repetitions.
The fast-mapping task differed from the word-learning
task in that significantly fewer models were provided
for each word, the child was not asked to imitate the
words, and no feedback regarding accuracy of response
was provided. A more detailed description of the instructional approach may be found in Gray (2003b).
Undergraduate students majoring in speech and
hearing sciences served as RAs. They were required to
demonstrate standardized presentation and scoring of
the research tasks before study initiation. For each 30min research session, the RA and child sat at a childsize table at the child's preschool program. Due to absences, some children did not complete the studies in
the planned amount of time. The mean number of days
required to complete the studies was 5.9 days for the
SLI group and 5 days for the NL group.

Fast Mapping
The fast-mapping task proceeded in three identical
phases, as illustrated in the Appendix. All eight objects
(four target and four common), but no additional props,
were on the table during these probes. The RA administered the models and probes for each word in randomized order within each phase. Children received no feedback regarding the accuracy of their responses.

Word Learning
The word-learning task proceeded in four phases,
as illustrated in the Appendix. The same eight objects
used in Day 1 of the fast-mapping task were introduced
along with additional props (e.g., a Playmobile western
wagon set with horses, a family of four, and play-dough).
The procedures described below took place in the context of play and conversation. Within each phase, all of
the models for a particular word were provided before
proceeding to a comprehension probe of the word, and
the comprehension probe for that word was administered before the production probe for the word. It was
possible, therefore, for the RA to have completed each
step of the teaching process for one word within a particular phase while just beginning the process for another word. The models and probes for all words were
completed within one phase before moving to the next.
During Phase 1, the RA modeled the name of each
target object as it was presented to the child, followed
by a prompt for immediate imitation of the name (e.g.,
"This is the tenet....Say tenet"). A second model and
imitation prompt for each object name followed. Next,
the RA administered a comprehension probe for each
object (e.g., "Please hand me the tenet") followed by immediate feedback regarding accuracy of response (e.g.,
"Yes, that's the tenet" or, for an incorrect response,
"Here's the tenet"). Finally, the RA administered a production probe for each object (e.g., "What are you holding?") followed by immediate feedback regarding accuracy of response (e.g., "Right, that's the tenet" or, for an
incorrect response, "Here's the tenet"). After completion
of Phase 1, the RA followed the same procedures for
Phases 2 and 3. During Phase 4, the RA administered a
comprehension probe for each object followed by immediate feedback regarding accuracy of response. Then,
the RA administered a production probe for each object
followed by immediate feedback regarding accuracy of
response. Because the imitation requests, comprehension probes, and feedback required the RA to say the
name of each object, the child actually heard each name
spoken 24 times each session.
Responses to comprehension probes were scored as
correct if the child showed the RA the correct target
object. Responses to production probes were scored as
correct if the child produced all of the target word's phonemes correctly or consistently produced the same phonological variation of the word that preserved the correct vowel sound in the initial syllable (e.g., /ho tEm/ for
/ho kEm/). The same criteria were used for feedback responses. The child's immediate imitation of target words
informed scoring of questionable productions.
If the child named a target object correctly when
the RA had not provided a model or prompt, the RA recorded the response as a spontaneous production but
1122

provided no feedback. If the child spontaneously named
an object incorrectly, the RA provided feedback, counted
this feedback as the next scheduled model, and elicited
an immediate imitation. If the child spontaneously
named an object incorrectly and the RA had already
provided the allotted number of models, no feedback was
provided for the incorrect response.
To assess procedural and scoring reliability, a second RA scored 23% of the experimental sessions live.
Each RA and each child had at least one session doublescored with those sessions selected at random. The average point-to-point agreement for delivery of instructional procedures was 98% (range = 94%-100%).
Point-to-point agreement for scoring of child responses
was 92% (range 84%-100%).

Word-Learning Measures
Children's word learning was measured in four
ways: (a) number of words learned to criterion for comprehension and production; (b) number of trials to criterion for comprehension and production; (c) change in
drawing score ratings for target objects from Day 1 to
Day 5; (d) comprehension, recognition, and production
of target names after Day 5 using color photographs of
the target objects. The drawing task was designed to
measure the change in children's semantic knowledge
of the target objects. The comprehension, recognition, and
production measures were designed to assess children's
learning in a different context than the teaching environment after all children had an equal number of opportunities to learn the words.
To reach criterion for comprehension or production
of a word, children were required to respond correctly
to three of four probes on 2 of 3 consecutive word-learning days. Sixteen trials were possible for comprehension and 16 were possible for production (4 days x 4
trials). This criterion level was chosen because Kiernan
and Gray (1998) indicated that the NL group could meet
this criterion for three words in 5 days. Further, the
probability of meeting the criteria by chance was small.
Each comprehension or production probe counted as
one trial. Responses to probes during the fast-mapping
task were not counted as trials. Trials to criterion were
calculated by counting the number of trials elapsed before a child reached learning criterion for either comprehension or production of each word. Teaching continued for each word even though a child had met
learning criterion.
The drawing measure was conducted in the same
manner as the previously described semantic drawing
task. At the end of the fast-mapping task on Day 1, the
child was asked to draw pictures of the four target objects and the four common objects. These were presented

in counterbalanced order across children. This same task
was repeated on Day 6 after children had completed
the word-learning task. Using the procedure and scale
described above for the semantic drawing task, three
adults rated children's drawings of the target and common objects. During scoring, the first and second drawings were counterbalanced so that raters were unaware
of their order. Interrater agreement was high. The standard deviation for the three raters' scores for the preand postdrawings of the box and tenet were calculated
for each child. The mean standard deviations for the
drawing ratings were as follows: prebox SD = 0.88, range
= 0-2.89; postbox SD = 1.04, range = 0-2.51; pretenet
SD = 0.87, range = 0-3.46; posttenet SD = 0.96, range =
0-2.51.
Comprehension, recognition, and production of the
target names were assessed with a posttest after the
drawing measure. The format was similar to a vocabulary test, with the order of probe type counterbalanced
across participants. For the comprehension test, four
color photographs (one target and three foils) appeared
in a 2 x 2 array on the page. The position of the target
varied in relation to the foils. One of the foils on each
page depicted a play object that was present each day
during the word-learning task (e.g., wagon), one depicted
another target object, and one depicted an object the
child hadn't seen in the study that was similar in shape
and category to the target object. For example, the foil
for the physic (flower) was a picture of a tree.
For production and recognition, a single photograph
of the target object appeared in the center of the page.
For the recognition test, the RA pointed to the picture
and said, "Listen first, then tell me the right name" then
spoke four names (one target, three foils) with the order
of the target varying in relation to the foils. One foil
name was phonologically identical to the target word
except that the initial consonant was changed to a consonant from a different category (e.g., a stop was substituted for a fricative). One foil was the name of another
target object, and one foil was a two-syllable, CVCVC
English word expected to be unfamiliar to the child that
was not used in the study. Children earned 1 point for
each correct response on each test. Because of the limited number of possible responses, the probability of a
child responding correctly by chance on the comprehension or recognition measures (1/4) was higher than for
the production probe or the drawing measure.

Results
Fast Mapping
There were 12 possible correct responses for comprehension and 12 for production (4 words x 3 probes).

The children knew the names of the four common objects present during the comprehension probes; therefore, the probability of identifying the correct target object by chance during a comprehension probe would be
1
/4, or .25, for each probe with a group mean of 3 representing chance for the comprehension measure. The combined group mean for comprehension of 7.52 was better
than chance, t(39) = 9.78, p < .0001.
Children's total number of correct responses to comprehension and production probes for target items during the fast-mapping task was subjected to a repeated
measures mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with group (NL or SLI) as the between-group factor and
probe type (comprehension or production) as the withingroup factor. Significant main effects were found for
group, F(1, 38) = 6.13, p = .0179, 2 = .14, and probe
type, F(1, 38) = 298.32, p < .0001, 2 = .87, qualified by a
significant Probe Type x Group interaction, F(1, 38) =
5.41, p < .0254, 2 = .01. Tukey follow-up indicated that
the NL group produced significantly more correct responses to comprehension probes (M = 8.65, SD = 2.50)
than did the SLI group (M = 6.40, SD = 2.95), but significant differences were not found for production (M =
1.70, SD = 1.59, and M = 1.10, SD = 0.91, respectively,
for the SLI and NL groups). Both groups responded correctly to more comprehension than production probes.

Words to Criterion
To reach learning criterion for comprehension or
production of a word, children were required to respond
correctly to three of four probes on 2 of 3 study days,
with 16 trials possible. Although a number of common
objects and familiar toys were present during the comprehension probes, it was expected that children could
eliminate these as possible correct choices. Therefore,
the probability of a child identifying the correct object
by chance in three of four comprehension probes on a
single day was 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/4, or .0156. The probability of
identifying the correct object by chance in three of four
comprehension probes for 2 days to reach learning criterion would be 1/64 x 1/64, or .0002, with a group mean of
1 representing chance performance. The combined group
mean of 3.75 was better than chance, t(39) = 29.56, p <
.0001.
The number of words children learned to criterion
for comprehension was analyzed using a Wilcoxon/
Mann-Whitney nonparametric procedure to test for
between-group differences. This procedure was selected
because the NL group scored at ceiling; consequently,
the data were not normally distributed. The betweengroup difference was significant (z = 3.09, p = .001), with
the NL group learning to comprehend more words (M =
4.00, SD = 0) than the SLI group (M = 3.50, SD = 0.80).

The number of words children learned to criterion
for production was analyzed using an ANOVA to test for
between-group differences. The between-group difference was significant F(1, 39) = 18.67, p = .0001, 2 = .33,
with the NL group learning to produce more words (M =
3.45, SD = 0.76) than the SLI group (M = 2.05, SD =
1.23).

Trials to Criterion for Word
Learning
The mean number of trials children required to
reach learning criterion for comprehension and production of a word was analyzed by means of a repeated
measures, mixed factorial ANOVA with group as the
between-group factor and probe type as the within-group
factor. This analysis did not include trials for any word
for which learning criterion was not met. Significant
main effects were found for group, F(1, 36) = 15.23, p =
.0004, 2 = .30, and probe type, F(1, 36) = 57.85, p <
.0001, 2 = .62. There was no significant interaction.
Tukey follow-up indicated that the NL group required
significantly fewer trials to reach learning criterion for
comprehension (M = 9.10, SD = 1.29) and production (M
= 11.60, SD = 2.09) of a word than did the SLI group (M
= 10.78, SD = 2.58, and M = 13.83, SD = 1.50, for comprehension and production, respectively). Both groups
required fewer trials to reach learning criterion for comprehension than production of a word.

Word-Learning Drawing
Some children achieved relatively high drawing
scores on the 1st day of the study, indicating that they
had already mapped sufficient semantic information
about the target objects to draw them: 35 of 80 1st-day
target-object drawings by the NL group and 23 of 80
target-object drawings by the SLI group achieved scores
of 4 or better on the 7-point scale. A chi-square analysis
revealed, however, that the group drawing scores did
not differ significantly for either target, 2(2, N = 34) =
40.00, p = .2211, or foil objects, 2(2, N = 30) = 33.33, p =
.3083. The finding of no between-group difference for
the foil objects provides evidence that the SLI group was
not at a disadvantage because of poorer artistic ability.
The change in children's drawing scores for target
objects from Days 1 to 5 of the study was derived by
subtracting the score for their first drawing from the
score for their second drawing. The difference scores were
averaged within groups and subjected to an ANOVA.
The between-group difference was not significant, F(1,
38) = 1.50, p = .2285, 2 = .04. The mean drawing difference scores were 1.26 (SD = 1.03) for the NL group and
0.75 (SD = 1.76) for the SLI group.

Posttask Assessment of
Comprehension, Recognition,
and Production
The posttask assessment probed children's comprehension, recognition, and production of each target word
one time. There were four possible choices for each comprehension and recognition probe (one target; three foils).
The probability of identifying the correct target object
by chance would be 1/4, or .25, for each probe, with a
mean of 1 for the four words. The combined group mean
for comprehension of 3.95 was better than chance, t(39)
= 84.53, p < .0001, as was the combined group mean of
3.85 for recognition, t(39) = 42.25, p < .0001.
Children's comprehension, recognition, and production of target words at the end of the study were analyzed using a Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney nonparametric
procedure to test for between-group differences. This procedure was used because the scores for comprehension
and recognition were close to or at ceiling and therefore
were not normally distributed. No between-group differences were found for comprehension, recognition, or production. The NL group mean was 3.90 (SD = 0.33) for
comprehension, 3.95 (SD = 0.22) for recognition, and 4.00
(SD = 0) for production. Mean scores for the SLI group
were 4.00 (SD = 0) for comprehension, 3.75 (SD = 0.55)
for recognition, and 3.35 (SD = 0.99) for production.

Relationships Among Test Scores,
Task Scores, Fast Mapping, and
Word Learning
Forward stepwise multiple regression analyses were
used to assess the relationships among test and task
scores, fast mapping, and word learning. For the first
set of analyses, the number of correct responses to comprehension and production probes on the fast-mapping
task was the dependent variable. All test and experimental task scores were entered as predictor variables.
PPVT-III (R2 = .26) and BBTOP (R2 = .11) scores were
significant predictors for fast-mapping comprehension,
and PPVT-III (R2 = .21) and K-ABC (R2 = .10) scores
were significant predictors for production.
The number of words learned to criterion for comprehension and production was the dependent variable
in the second set of analyses. All test and experimental
task scores were entered as predictors in the first analysis, then fast-mapping comprehension and production
were entered as predictors in a second analysis. For the
first analysis, PPVT-III scores (R2 = .21) were the only
significant predictor for the number of words comprehended. The Structured Photographic Expressive Language Test-II (SPELT-II; Werner & Krescheck, 1983;
R2 = .25) and the semantic drawing task (R2 = .09) were

significant predictors for the number of words children
learned to produce. For the second analysis, fast-mapping comprehension (R2 = .11) was a significant predictor of word-learning comprehension, and fast-mapping
production (R2 = .17) was a significant predictor of wordlearning production.
The mean number of trials to criterion for comprehension and production was the dependent variable for
the third set of analyses, which used all test and experimental task scores as predictors and then fast-mapping
comprehension and production as predictors. No test or
task was a significant predictor for trials to criterion for
comprehension. For production, the nonword repetition
task (R2 = .31) was the only significant predictor. Fastmapping comprehension (R2 = .11) was a significant predictor for trials to criterion for comprehension, and fastmapping production (R2 = .23) was a significant predictor
for trials to criterion for production.

Post Hoc Analysis of Word
Learning
Every child in the NL group learned to comprehend
the maximum number of words possible, and 19 of 20
children learned to produce three or four words. Based
on this level of performance by their peers, 1 child from
the NL group and 7 children from the SLI group who
performed below this level were identified as poor word
learners.

children met learning criterion for comprehension or
production of a word, their drawing score was always 4
or above.
If the child's drawing score was 4 or higher and the
child met learning criterion for comprehension of the
word and responded correctly to comprehension and
recognition probes on the posttest but did not meet learning criterion for production, this was taken as evidence
that the child had semantic knowledge of the object but
insufficient phonological representation to produce the
word consistently. Overall, poor learners appeared to
store enough semantic information about the objects
they were learning to name to draw those objects and to
comprehend their names, but they had difficulty producing them.

Discussion
This study investigated children's word learning
past the initial fast-mapping stage as they learned the
referential meaning for new words. We replicated research demonstrating that SLI groups learn fewer words
than NL groups (e.g., Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996,
1998; Gray, 2003b; Kiernan & Gray, 1998; Rice et al.,
1990) and require more trials to do so (Gray, 2003b).

T tests revealed that the mean scores for normal
learners (all those not identified as poor learners) differed significantly from the mean scores for poor learners on the SPELT-II, Paragraph Comprehension subtest
of the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language
(CASL-PC; Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999), and PPVT-III. T tests
also revealed that normal and poor learners differed significantly on fast-mapping production, number of words
learned to criterion for comprehension and production,
and trials to criterion for comprehension and production.

By analyzing individual and group performance, we
found that 30% of the children with SLI learned as many
words as the NL group, 30% performed similarly to their
SLI peers, and 35% were considered poor learners relative to the SLI group. One child from the NL group was
also identified as a poor word learner. Although his parents and teachers reported no concerns about his development, his difficulty here suggests that further evaluation of his language skills is warranted. Note that the
degree of success demonstrated by both groups occurred
in a context that presented multiple opportunities to
hear and produce the words in a one-to-one learning situation. These results would undoubtedly differ in more
challenging contexts.

Table 3 provides a detailed description of the poor
learners' performance on word-learning comprehension
and production, drawing, and posttesting comprehension, recognition, and production. Based on children's
performance on these measures, the table also indicates
whether semantics or phonology appeared to be problematic for word learning. Poor learners' drawings of
target objects that are rated in Table 3 may be found in
Table 4.

The drawing task, developed by McGregor and Appel
(2002) and adapted for this study, successfully documented children's growth of semantic knowledge. Both
groups achieved higher scores for drawings of target
objects made on the last day of the study than for those
made on the first day of the study. McGregor and Appel
(2002) viewed this task as "a valuable window into the
semantic knowledge of young children" (p. 17), and this
proved true in the current study.

The following criteria determined whether the child
appeared to have greater difficulty with semantics or
phonology. If the child's final drawing of the object was
rated below 4, this was taken as evidence that the child
lacked semantic knowledge of the object. Note that when

What predicted word-learning success? Children's
existing lexical knowledge, as measured by the PPVTIII, predicted comprehension and production performance on the fast-mapping task and predicted the number of words children learned to comprehend during

With one exception, every poor learner in this study
scored below the SLI group mean for the PPVT-III. Note
that this level of performance would typically not serve
as a red flag to clinicians or researchers because poor
learners' standard scores were within the normal range
of 85 to 97. Performance on the PPVT-III holds promise
as an identifier for poor word learners but requires scores
to be considered in relation to SLI group performance.

1128

To accomplish this, researchers and clinicians might
develop local norms for SLI groups or might consider
children's performance in relation to data reported in
the test manual for language-impaired groups. For example, the PPVT-III technical manual (Williams &
Wang, 1997) reports that a clinical group of 53 children
ages 6;1 through 13;4 with language impairment and
their matched controls had mean scores of 96.8 (SD =

10.5) and 104.8 (SD = 15.3), respectively, on Form A of
the PPVT-III (p. 35). Mean scores for the SLI and NL
groups in this study were nearly identical to those reported for similar groups in the PPVT-III technical
manual.
The SPELT-II, a language test designed to assess
expressive grammatical morphology, was a significant
predictor for the number of words children learned to
produce. Further, the means for normal and poor learners were significantly different on this measure. Despite
this, the SPELT-II may not help identify poor word learners because, unlike on the PPVT-III, poor learners scored
above and below the SLI mean on this test. BBTOP and
K-ABC scores accounted for a small but significant
amount of variance for fast-mapping comprehension and
production, respectively, but the scores did not differ significantly for normal and poor learners.
Children's fast-mapping performance was related
to the number of words they learned to comprehend and
produce and to learning rate, with fast-mapping comprehension predicting word-learning comprehension and

fast-mapping production predicting word-learning production. Although the amount of word-learning variance
accounted for by fast mapping was relatively small, fastmapping performance may help identify poor word learners. Every poor learner scored below the SLI group mean
for the number of correct responses to comprehension
and production probes on the fast-mapping task.
The nonword repetition task, a measure of shortterm phonological memory, predicted 31% of the variance associated with the number of trials children required to reach learning criterion for production, but
scores on this task did not differ for normal and poor
learners. In past studies, this task has been scored using percentage phonemes correct (PPC) rather than
whole-word scoring. Data loss prevented this type of
scoring in the present study; however, it is possible that
with PPC scoring, differences would emerge.
We used a variety of methods to assess word learning to investigate whether poor learners demonstrated
difficulty establishing semantic representations of new
words at the lemma level or whether they had difficulty

with the phonological representations of new words at
the lexeme level. The drawing task provided an assessment of children's semantic knowledge of target objects.
In most cases, the poor learners stored enough semantic information to convincingly draw the objects that they
could not consistently name. Six of the poor learners,
however, showed evidence that they had not stored or
could not retrieve sufficient semantic information about
a particular object to draw it. When this occurred, they
also did not reach criterion for production of the word.
There is evidence that children with SLI fast map fewer
semantic attributes of objects than NL peers (Alt, Plante,
& Creusere, 2004) and that poor naming is associated
with limited semantic representation (McGregor et al.,
2002). This appeared to be the case for some of the words
poor learners could not produce consistently.
There was also evidence that phonology presented
an obstacle to word learning. McGregor et al. (2002)
proposed that accurate semantic representation of a
word in conjunction with poor naming suggests a problem with storage or retrieval of its phonological form,
and this frequently seemed to be the case for poor learners in this study. For most words, poor learners demonstrated sufficient phonological representation to consistently comprehend and recognize new words and to draw
their referents, yet they could not consistently produce
the words. The 3 poorest learners clearly demonstrated
difficulty creating stable phonological representations
of words when they failed to meet criterion for comprehension despite drawing accurate representations of the
words' referents.
What is the best approach for helping poor word
learners learn new words? Should clinicians emphasize
semantics, phonology, or both? Future research may begin to sort this out by using methods to selectively
strengthen semantics or phonology. For example, Demke,
Graham, and Siakaluk (2002) demonstrated that preschoolers with NL learned new words more readily if
they were exposed to similar-sounding words from the
same phonological neighborhood after hearing the new
word, presumably helping them maintain a phonological representation of the new word in working memory.
Because lexical acquisition is a critical component
of children's language and literacy growth, researchers
and clinicians want to identify children at risk for wordlearning problems while they are very young, identify
the source of their problem, and treat it effectively. Results from this study demonstrate that existing lexical
knowledge and fast-mapping ability hold promise as
screens for poor word learning, but test scores cannot
be interpreted in relation to normative means. Poor word
learners appear to have difficulty with both semantics
and phonology, with the production of new words presenting the biggest hindrance to success.
