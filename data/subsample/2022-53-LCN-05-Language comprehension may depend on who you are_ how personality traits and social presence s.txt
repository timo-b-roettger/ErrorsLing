ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Although it has been scarcely investigated, personality might help shape language comprehension
during social interaction. The aim is to investigate how differences in personality might affect
morphosyntactic processing and whether it may be affected by social presence. In a correctness
judgement task, participants read sentences that were correct or contained a morphosyntactic
error, either while alone or in the mere presence of a confederate. Participants' NEO-FFI
personality inventory scores were used to analyse behavioural, and event related potential data.
Neuroticism and Extraversion interacted with error rate and reaction time, while
Conscientiousness only interacted with reaction time. A weak N400-like component to
morphosyntactic anomalies was triggered for introverts in the social presence condition,
compared to a LAN in the alone one, while a LAN was triggered in both conditions for
extraverts. Whereas higher Conscientiousness was related to a stronger LAN and a weaker P600
component, lower Conscientiousness reflected the opposite pattern.

Introduction
Personality psychology addresses individual differences
in behaviour, emotion, motivation, and cognition
(DeYoung et al., 2010). While it is well established that
personality may help mediate our responses to our
environment, the extent to which it accounts for individual differences in cognitive processes, particularly in
language, is still understudied.
The Big Five model is the most widely used taxonomy
of personality (DeYoung & Blain, 2020), categorising trait
descriptors into five broad domains comprised of underlying sub-facets (Costa & McCrae, 1992): Extraversion,
Neuroticism, Openness to experience, Agreeableness
and Conscientiousness. Extraversion, the tendency
toward positive affectivity (Brower et al., 2015), affects
how active and sociable, or how reserved and passive
individuals are (Roslan et al., 2017). Neuroticism is understood as the tendency toward negative affectivity,
emotional distress, anxiety, and higher threat assessment (Costa & McCrae, 1992; McCrae & Costa, 1987).
Openness to experience is related to cognitive and perceptual flexibility, imagination and intellectual

engagement (DeYoung et al., 2005; DeYoung & Blain,
2020). Agreeableness describes one's regard for the
rights and wishes of others, and the tendency to be compliant, polite and compassionate as opposed to aggressive and insensitive (DeYoung & Blain, 2020). Lastly,
Conscientiousness refers to a range of constructs that
reflects the propensity to be self-controlled, responsible
towards others, hardworking, orderly, and rule-abiding
(Jackson & Roberts, 2017). Brain-imaging studies have
linked variation in regional volume differences with
four of the Big Five traits, potentially highlighting biological bases associated with these traits (DeYoung
et al., 2010; DeYoung & Blain, 2020; Schmidtke &
Heller, 2004). Recently, researchers were able to predict
participant's scores on Big Five traits based on brain
activity analysis while they watched emotional film
clips (Zhao et al., 2017).
Currently, there is little understanding as to personality's relationship with language comprehension - a valid
question given that language networks do not function
in isolation but rather are subject to influence by various
extra-linguistic factors such as mood, emotions, speaker

characteristics, actions, and presence (Casado et al., 2018;
Hinchcliffe et al., 2020; Pulvermuller & Fadiga, 2016;
Tesink et al., 2009; Van Berkum et al., 2013; van den Brink
et al., 2012; Willems & Casasanto, 2011). Indeed, while
various findings imply that personality does impact
speech production (Hubert, 2020; Hubert & Jarvikivi,
2019; Park et al., 2015; Pennebaker & King, 1999; Yarkoni,
2010) and also phonetic convergence in English L2 learners (Lewandowski & Jilka, 2019), few studies have
honed in on how personality intervenes in language processing and particularly in syntax. An important question
in psycholinguistic research which should be explored in
order to fully understand the language machinery and its
functional significance in relation with other human
brain processes.
Boland and Queen (2016) recently found that certain
Big Five personality traits (namely Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) affected how likely
participants were to either ignore or be sensitive to
formal versus informal written language errors,
suggesting that certain errors may be interpreted as
having different social implications according to one's
personality. Another study observed correlations
between reaction times when responding to morphosyntactic, semantic/pragmatic, and identity-clashing violations, and scores in Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extraversion and Neuroticism (Hubert, 2020). Recent
research by the same authors revealed an effect of Neuroticism on the processing of simple morpho-syntactic
errors by using pupillometry, whereby higher Neuroticism scores were correlated with a larger dilatation to
morpho-syntactic errors, as compared to lower scores
on this scale (Hubert, 2020; Hubert & Jarvikivi, 2019,
24-27 july). dark forces in language comprehension:
the case of neuroticism and disgust in a pupillometry
study proceedings of the 41st annual meeting of the
cognitive science society, montreal, qc). While these
findings support a potential relationship between personality and language processing, none take into
account the ways in which personality interacts with
context. In line with Revelle's (1993) position that "individual differences combine with situational manipulations to affect the availability and allocation of
cognitive resources", one might expect that different
social circumstances may interact with personality in
order to affect language processing.
Given its temporal resolution, Event-Related brain
Potentials (ERP) is a common technique used to study
language processing. Psycholinguistic research upholds
that there is an early stage of (mostly) parallel semantic
and syntactic processing (represented in part by the
N400 and LAN components, respectively) succeeded
by a later integration stage (P600 component) that

allows interaction between different types of information (Molinaro et al., 2011; Steinhauer & Connolly,
2008). The negative centro-parietal fluctuation around
400 ms (N400) in response to semantic errors is understood as a fundamental indicator of semantic processing
(Kutas & Federmeier, 2011) and likely represents the
amount of resources needed to integrate word
meaning into a current context (Wang & Knosche,
2013). The left anterior negativity (LAN) component
(100-500 ms), associated with first-pass parsing (Hahne
& Friederici, 1999) has been reported for grammatical
anomalies including morphosyntactic violations (e.g,
number violations and subject-verb violations) (Steinhauer & Connolly, 2008). Lastly, the later (600-
1000 ms) centro-parietal positive component (P600)
reflects a more general marker for structural processing
and reanalysis due to morphosyntactic violations (Molinaro et al., 2011; Steinhauer & Connolly, 2008), while
the "semantic P600", that is triggered by semantic
anomalies instead of syntactic ones, is linked to the
evaluation of the veridicality of one's analysis (van
Herten et al., 2005) and the assessment of incoming
information to update the mental model (Burkhardt,
2007).
Previously, we found that language processing
(specifically, ERP responses to semantic and syntactic
errors) was affected by social presence when participants performed a language correctness task in the presence of a confederate, as opposed to when they were
alone (Hinchcliffe et al., 2020). Overall, the presence condition was associated with a more centro-posterior LAN
component (interpreted as an N400). The results seem to
imply a boosting of heuristic language processing strategies characteristic of lexico-semantic operations, which
entails a shift to the morphosyntactic violations processing strategy that is typically based on algorithmic or
rule-based strategies. Whereas the heuristic processing
style is more holistic, not taking all available information
into account while relying on shortcuts and previous
knowledge, algorithmic processing engages more
detailed, systematic and rule-based strategies. Personality traits have been related with the use of heuristic strategies and decision-making (Belhekar, 2017; Haley &
Stumpf, 1989; Martin-Loeches et al., 2009; Vissers et al.,
2013). In this regard, high Conscientiousness is characterised by the propensity towards rule-abiding
(Jackson & Roberts, 2017), promoting rule-based strategies, while low Conscientiousness might promote the
use of heuristic strategies. Furthermore, personality is
considered by some authors to be an important contributor in explaining social presence effects (Aiello &
Kolb, 1995). Though personality's role in social facilitation is typically framed around Extraversion and

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

Neuroticism and their interaction with self-esteem (Uziel,
2010), it is plausible that other factors may also influence
the response to social presence. For example, co-representation studies indicate that people tend to
monitor others' performance and remember what their
co-actor needs to be doing throughout the experiment,
even when it impairs one's performance or is not
required to perform one's own task (Bockler et al.,
2012). Along these lines, it is plausible that the extent
to which people are compassionate (Agreeableness),
task-driven (Conscientiousness), and/or willing to try
new things (Openness) could also impact the degree
to which they are affected by the presence of another
person and how they interpret aspects of social presence in general.
It is important to better comprehend the ways in
which individual differences, including personality, contribute not only to social facilitation effects, but also to
language processing. The present study aims to
explore whether personality may be related to differences in language processing in terms of ERPs with a
specific interest in morphosyntactic processing, which,
although traditionally thought of as encapsulated
(Fodor, 1983; Hauser et al., 2002) has been shown to
be influenced by external factors (Casado et al., 2018;
Hinchcliffe et al., 2020; Verhees et al., 2015; Vissers
et al., 2010). Along these lines, the present study also
intends to investigate the potential relationship
between personality traits and behavioural and psychophysiological measures, and how these interactions
might differ according to social context. To this aim, participants read sentences that could contain syntactic
anomalies while being either alone or in the mere presence of a confederate. They also completed the NEO Five
Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (Costa & McCrae, 1992) in
order to explore processing differences as a function of
personality traits.
We expect personality-related modulations of
language comprehension components both in the
alone and in the mere presence conditions, since previous literature, though scarce, described influences of
personality traits on language processing. Regarding
the skin conductance response, we predict larger skin
conductance levels in the social presence condition
than in the alone condition, specifically for low extrovert
participants when judging syntactic anomalies. In
addition, given that correlations between reaction
times and personality traits such as Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Neuroticism have been previously reported for a morphosyntactic task (Hubert,
2020), we also expect error rate and reaction time modulation amongst personality traits. Modulations of amplitude and topography are also expected in the syntax-

367

related component. In this regard, a high level of Conscientiousness involves higher rule abiding, potentially
promoting a rule-based strategy, which has been
related with more anterior component topographies.
In contrast, lower Conscientiousness might result in a
more centro-parietal component distribution. Furthermore, according to the personality and language
research reviewed above, personality modulations of
syntax processing might be expected to differ in the
mere presence condition. Specific predictions are hard
to establish, given the variety of possible causes for
social presence effects (for a detailed discussion see
(Hinchcliffe et al., 2020)); while Extraversion and Neuroticism are expected to interact with social presence effects
to some degree (Aiello & Kolb, 1995), effects of other
personality traits would not be unexpected.

Materials & methods
Participants
Twenty-eight female and two male (n = 30) Spanishspeaking University Students (mean age = 22.5, SD =
2.7) participated in the study after giving informed
consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki and
with the approval of the ethics committee of the Complutense University. Ultimately, data from one (female)
participant was excluded from personality-related analyses following their incorrect completion of the NEOFFI, yielding analyses from a total of 29 participants. All
participants had self-reported normal or corrected-tonormal vision, no history of neural or cognitive disorders.
They were not on antipsychotic medications, tricyclic
antidepressants medication in the 3 months prior to
the study, no NSAIDs, opioids, corticosteroids, anxiolytics medication, presence of pain, or any disease
symptom in the last 24 h prior to the study. They were
all right-handed (M = 78.90, SD = 21.90), according to
the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971),
and did not have reading difficulty. In order to be
included, participants had to be native Spanish speakers
and have lived in Spain for at least five years prior to the
study in order to be familiar with the vocabulary utilised
in the language task.

Materials
In order to measure personality, participants completed
a validated Spanish version (Cordero et al., 1999) of the
NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (Costa & McCrae,
1992), a shorter version of the Revised NEO Personality
Inventory which includes a total of 60 items (12 per
domain). The scale measures five main domains:

Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experience,
Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness.
The language material consisted of 200 experimental
Spanish sentences plus fillers (100 correct and 100 syntactic incorrect). Each experimental sentence, which
was originally correct, was modified to form an incorrect
version of the sentence containing a syntactic anomaly.
The same sentences were used in Hinchcliffe et al.
(2020), half of which were also used in a previous experiment (Jimenez-Ortega et al., 2017). Both short sentences (determiner-noun-adjective-verb-complement)
and long sentences (determiner-noun-adjective-nounpreposition-complement) exemplified structures commonly used in Spanish (see Table 1 for examples). The
fillers were also long and short sentences, with structures other than those used in the experimental sentences. These fillers served to increase the structure
variability of the sentences as well as the location and
type of linguistic errors.
The syntactic anomaly could be presented in the
adjective or in the verb. Syntactic violations in the adjective consisted of either a gender violation or a number
violation, whereas in the verb they were always a
number violation. Frequency, valence, and length of
critical words were not counterbalanced, as they were
used in all conditions. In total, three different sets of sentences were composed, containing different combinations of sentences and avoiding the repetition of an
experimental sentence within a given set. They were
counterbalanced according to gender, number and
location of the anomaly (i.e. in the adjective or verb),
and sentence length. Additionally, each presentation
set was divided into two halves, one for the alone condition, the other for the social presence condition. Subjects saw each experimental sentence only once, only
in one version, and only in one condition (social/
alone). Although each presentation set was presented
to ten participants, yielding a total sample of 30 participants, one participant did not correctly complete the

NEO-FFI, leading to a final total of 29 participants
included in the analyses.

Procedure
Participants were seated in a quiet, isolated room
approximately 70 cm in front of an LCD screen, with
visual angles around 0.8 to 4. Each trial began with a
fixation cross (500 ms) in the centre of the screen, followed by the rest of the sentence, presented word by
word in the centre of the monitor. Each word was presented for 200 ms, with an inter-stimulus-interval of
300 ms (Figure 1). All writing was presented in white
letters against a black background using 30-point Arial
font. The first word of each sentence started with a
capital letter, and the last word was followed by a
period. One second after the sentence finished, a question mark was presented in the centre of the monitor
for 1.5 s, during which time the participant indicated
the sentence's correctness by pressing one of two
buttons. The hand used for this task was counterbalanced across subjects. In order to avoid ocular artifacts
during the electroencephalogram recordings, participants were asked not to blink in the time between the
fixation cross and the question mark.
Both conditions of the experiment were carried out on
the same day, each lasting about 30 min. In the social
condition, a confederate was seated approximately
55 cm to the participants' right, such that the confederate
was within the participant's peripheral vision (see Figure
2). The confederate was always of the same sex as the participant and posed as a university student. The researcher
explained the confederate's task in front of the participant, explaining that the confederate was participating
in a trial run for an experiment on memory. The confederate, who was an actor, was audibly instructed to read the
sentences being presented in order to later complete a
recognition memory task, in which they would indicate
which sentences had been presented. In order to seem

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the procedure: Each word in a sentence was presented for 200 ms. The sentence could be
correct or could have a syntactic (number or gender) disagreement in the adjective or in the verb. In this example, the syntactic
anomaly was in the verb (literal translation: the naughty students makes mischief).

realistic, the researcher showed them both an example of
what the memory questionnaire would look like. Once
the participant understood the task, they completed a
short training consisting of 24 representative sentences
which were not later included in the experiment. The
order of presentation of the social/alone conditions was
counterbalanced across participants. After completing
the study, the participant was given access to complete
a validated Spanish version of the NEO-FFI (Cordero
et al., 1999).

Throughout the experiment, we collected information regarding participants' arousal levels by means
of skin conductance recordings. A Skin Conductance
(SC) sensor was attached to the index and middle
finger of the hand not being used to respond. In order
to compare skin conductance means between conditions, subject data was first normalised. Individual
measures of skin conductance recordings were averaged
together for each participant separately, while the grand
mean was assigned a value of 1. Therefore, skin

studies on language and social presence (Hinchcliffe
et al., 2020), although they imply certain loss of information and power.

EEG and GSR recordings
The electroencephalogram was recorded using 61 electrodes according to the 10/20 International System.
The right mastoid (M2) served as the on-line reference,
recalculated off-line to M1-M2 average reference. Eye
movements were recorded through electrodes placed
above and below the left eye (VEOG) as well as on the
outer corner of both eyes (HEOG). Electrode impedance
kept below 5 K. Skin conductance (SC) data were synchronously recorded with the EEG data through an 8channel Multibox polygraph (IEEC 60601-1, GSR
module, Brain Products, Munich).
The EEG and SC data were analysed with Brain Vision
Analyzer(R) software. The continuous EEG recordings were
divided into segments of 1200 ms, starting 200 ms to
onset of the critical word (adjective or verb). All EEG
data was recorded with a 0.01-100 Hz band-pass and
offline filtered with a 0.1-30 Hz band-pass filter. Ocular
artifacts were corrected through Independent Component Analyses (ICA). Epochs exceeding  100 V and
epochs that contained artifacts were eliminated. The
resulting epochs were included both in the EEG and
GSR analyses.

Repeated measures ANOVA analyses
Based on their scores on the adapted version (Cordero
et al., 1999) of the NEO-FFI (Costa & McCrae, 1992), participants were grouped according to whether their score
was below or above the median score for that trait (see
Table 2 for distribution). Participants with a score equal
to the median were assigned to the group above the
median.
For statistical analyses of the ERP, clusters of electrodes constituting six regions of interest (ROI) were constructed. The ROIs were composed as follows: Left
Anterior (F5, F3, F1, FC5, FC3, and FC1 electrodes),
Right Anterior (F2, F4, F6, FC2, FC4, FC6), Left Central
(C5, C3, C1, CP5, CP3, CP1), Right Central (C2, C4, C6,
CP2, CP4, CP6), Left Posterior (P5, P3, P1, PO3), and
Right Posterior (P2, P4, P6, PO4). The repeated-measures
ANOVAs included five factors: Hemisphere (left, right),
Region (anterior, central, and posterior), Correctness
(correct and incorrect), Social Presence (social, alone).
All Big Five personality traits were used as dichotomous
inter-subject factors. Violations of the sphericity assumption were corrected, when necessary, by the Greenhouse-Geisser method, and post hoc tests were
corrected by the Bonferroni method.
Time windows were elected following visual inspection of the waveforms. The 400-500 ms window was
used to analyse the left anterior negativity (LAN) component, and the 600-800 ms window was chosen to
analyse the P600 syntactic component. Although the
600-700 ms and 700-800 ms windows were explored
separately, using these smaller windows did not significantly change the overall results. As such, the 200 ms
window was used for simplicity.

Results
Analysis
Both repeated ANOVA and Linear Mixed models' analyses were calculated, taking in account the advantage
and disadvantages of each one. Although linear model
analyses can incorporate continuous predictors such as
personality traits into their calculations (Gelman & Hill,
2007), there is not yet a common agreement about
how topographical factors should be treated in such
analyses (for different approaches see: Caffarra et al.,
2019; Nickels et al., 2013). While Repeated ANOVA analyses allow statistical comparison, topographic and
wave representations of high vs. low personality traits
and they also maximise comparability with previous

Linear mixed model analyses
Linear mixed models were calculated in SPSS 22 using
the same time windows and ROIS used in the repeated
ANOVA. Each time window was analysed by first fitting
a linear mixed effect model and then subjecting the
resulting model to a type 3 ANOVA analysis, with

Personality data
The participants' mean scores, compared to university
students in the general population as a comparative
reference sample for our group of participants, can be
seen in Table 3. Our sample was similar to the Spanish
University population (Cordero et al., 1999) as no significant differences between participants and the reference
sample were observed (all Ts < 1.63, all ps > .1).
Independent samples t-tests comparing the means
for low and high groups in each NEO factor confirmed
that for each trait the two groups differed significantly
(see Table 4).

> .1). Additionally, NEO scores did not appear associated
with differences in neither reaction time nor error rate;
reaction time analyses revealed no interactions with
NEO scores and social condition (all Fs < 3.84, all ps
> .09) nor sentence type (all Fs < .734, all ps > .4), and
error rate analyses revealed no interactions between
NEO scores and social presence condition or sentence
type, either (all Fs < 2.96, all ps > .12; all Fs < .875, all ps
> .37, respectively).
Linear mixed models were calculated for both error
rates and reaction times, introducing Presence, and Correctness as repeated factors, and the five personality
traits as covariates. For error rates, significant differences
were observed for Correctness (F(1,105.97) = 4.48, p
= .037), Neuroticism (F(1,105.97) = 9.1, p = .003), and
Extraversion (F(1,105.45) = 4.2, p = .43). Larger error
rates were observed for correct sentences, and linear
trends indicated that higher levels of Neuroticism corresponded to larger error rates and vice versa, while the
opposite pattern was observed for Extraversion. Other

Behavioural data
Behavioural data repeated ANOVA analyses indicated an
overall Correctness effect on error rate (F(1,9) = 17.56, p
= .002, h2p = .661,  = .960), with a significantly higher
error rate for correct sentences (M = .330, SE = .03) than
for syntactic anomaly sentences (M = .121, SE = .04; 
= .21, SE = .053, p = .003). Along these lines, there was a
significant Correctness effect on reaction time as well
(F(1,9) = 16.33, p = .003, h2p = .645,  = .948), due to a
longer reaction time for correct sentences (M = 524.13,
SE = 26.54) than for syntactic anomaly sentences (M =
457.25, SE = 22.87;  = 66.87, SE = 16.52, p = .003).
However, analyses did not reveal a main effect of
Social Presence Condition on either error rate (all Fs
< .757, all ps > .1) or reaction time (all Fs < 3.14, all ps

and Conscientiousness on error rates and reaction times.

significant findings were not observed (All Fs < 3.1, ps >
0.8). Finally, in regard to reaction times, significant differences were observed for Neuroticism (F(1,99.91) = 9.4, p
= .003), Extraversion (F(1,99.52) = 4.2, p = .006) and Conscientiousness (F(1,105.97) = 6.7, p = .011). Specifically,
higher scores of Neuroticisms and Conscientiousness
corresponded to longer reaction times and vice versa,
while for Extraversion the opposite pattern appeared
(Figure 3).

Skin conductance data
Normalised skin conductance data was analysed by
means of a repeated measures Correctness by Social
Presence ANOVA with all five personality traits as intersubject factors, yielding a virtually significant Social Presence Condition by Extraversion interaction (F(1,9) = 4.91,
p = .054, h2p = .353,  = .507). Post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that, indeed, participants that scored
lower in Extraversion showed significantly higher
arousal in the social condition (M = 2.04, SE = .323)
than when alone (M -.04, SE = .32;  = 2.08, p = .013).
Interestingly, this analysis also revealed a significant
Social Presence Condition by Openness interaction (F
(1,9) = 5.37, p = .046, h2p = .374,  = .543) which pairwise
comparisons indicated stemmed from a significant
difference for participants higher in Openness between
the alone (M -.051, SE = .290) and social presence conditions (M = 2.051, SE = .290;  = -2.101, p = .006). In
other words, it seems that both less extraverted participants and more open participants showed higher
measures of skin conductance in social presence than
when alone. Linear models analyses did not yield significant effects for any factor or interaction except for correctness (F(1,104.47) = 4.16, p = .044), where larger skin
conductance levels were observed for correct sentences
than for incorrect sentences.

EEG data
After removing incorrect trials and bad epochs, an
average of 29.59 and 37.38 (out of 50) correctly
answered trials were included in the data analyses for
correct and syntactic anomaly sentences, respectively.
As a consequence of the larger error rates produced
for correct sentences than for incorrect sentences, the
percentage of epochs included in the analyses was
smaller for correct than for incorrect trials (t(28) = 4.80,
p < .001).
Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed at two
separate time windows, namely, 400-500 ms and 600-
800 ms. The ANOVAs included four within-subjects
factors (Hemisphere (Left, Right), Region (Anterior,

Central, Posterior), Correctness (Correct, Incorrect),
Social Presence condition (Alone, Social Presence) and
five between-subject factors (personality traits Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Openness, and Conscientiousness)). Linear mixed models were calculated
using the same time windows and ROIS (that is, introducing Hemisphere, Region, Presence, and Correctness as
repeated factors, and the personality traits as covariates).
Given the large number of results provided by these analyses, linear mixed models results can be found in
Appendices 1 and 2, while only the significant results
of the repeated ANOVA analyses are reported here.
Overall, the main repeated measures ANOVA including all personality traits at the 400-500 ms window
yielded statistically significant Correctness effects, indicating the LAN component was indeed elicited during
this window (F(1,28) = 6.45, p = .032, h2p = .417, 
= .620). The same analyses in the 600-800 ms interval
revealed a significant syntactic P600 (F(1,28) = 43.87, p
< .001, h2p = .830,  = 1.00). Interactions between Social
Presence condition, Correctness and Region were also
observed at 400-500 ms and 600-800 ms windows (F
(2,56) = 6.95, p = .023, h2p = .436,  = .677; F(2,56) = 6.12,
p = .022, h2p = .405,  = .701, respectively). In addition,
multicollinearity analyses revealed that all VIF values
were between 1 and 10 (1.03 < VFs < 1.34), indicating
that the no multicollinearity assumption needed to calculate ANOVAS was met. Furthermore, correlation calculations among personality traits did not reveal any
significant correlations between traits (all rs < .23 ps
> .05) except between Neuroticism and Extraversion (r
= -.45, p = .013).
In line with the main aim of this study, interactions
between personality traits, correctness and/or presence
will be discussed below in detail. In this regard, both
the linear model analyses and repeated measures
ANOVA yielded significant correctness interactions
with Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness personality traits. The linear model analyses also
revealed significant effects of personality traits, either
for the alone condition or interacting with hemisphere
or/and region (Appendices 1 and 2). However, given
that they are outside of the scope of the present
article, they are neither reported nor discussed below.

Extraversion data
Repeated ANOVA analyses resulted in a statistically significant Correctness x Social Presence x Extraversion
interaction in the 400-500 ms window (F(1,9) = 5.60, p
= .042, h2p = .384,  = .560), indicating that level of Extraversion may interact with social contexts when triggering the LAN effect. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

highlighted that those participants lower in Extraversion showed a significantly more negative amplitude
of the LAN, as syntactic sentences showed a more
negative amplitude in the alone condition (M
-1.13 V, SE = .38) compared to the social presence
condition (M -.322 V, SE = .35;  = -.803 V, p < .05),
whereas correct sentence amplitude was essentially

373

unchanged. Furthermore, visual inspection suggested
that component distribution differed between Extraversion levels and according to social condition. Specifically, in the social presence condition these
participants showed a weaker and more posterior component in comparison to the alone condition. After subtracting correct sentence amplitude from syntactically

each condition and region of interest at 400-500 ms windows (C).

incorrect sentence amplitudes, the remaining data was
analysed by means of a Hemisphere x Region x Social
Presence ANOVA with Extraversion specifically as an
intersubject factor. This analysis revealed a Region x
Social Presence interaction (F(2,54) = 4.10, p = .048, h2p
= .132,  = .527), indicating that social presence
impacted the distribution of the LAN regardless of
level of Extraversion, leading specifically to the more
frontal LAN effects observed in the alone condition,
and more a posterior component resembling an N400
in the social condition (Figure 4).
Linear Model analyses at 400-500 ms found significant main effect of Extraversion and for the interaction
of Social Presence by Extraversion (ps < .05) (Appendix
1). Linear trends revealed that for the social condition,
smaller values in Extraversion corresponded to more
negative voltage while larger values corresponded to
more positive voltage, and vice versa for the alone condition (Figure 4). For the 600-800 ms window neither
Linear models nor repeated measure analyses yielded
significant results.

mean amplitude for each condition and region of interest at
400-500 ms windows.

Agreeableness data
Although the repeated measures ANOVA at the 400-
500 ms window did not indicate any significant effects,
according to the linear model analyses there was
indeed a significant Presence by Correctness by Agreeableness interaction (p < .05). Linear trends revealed a
complex interaction (Figure 5). Within the social condition, they indicated a negative component for low
Agreeableness, while it appeared a positive one for
high Agreeableness at all ROIS except for the left anterior
region. In the alone condition, this pattern seemed to
appear only at posterior regions. At the 600-800 ms
window neither the linear model analyses nor the
repeated ANOVA yielded any significant differences.

Conscientiousness data
The main repeated measures ANOVA revealed a trend
towards a Correctness by Conscientiousness interaction
(F(1,9) = 4.19, p = .073, h2p = .317,  = .447). Given the
purpose of the present study and linear models' significant results, we decided to calculate planned post-hoc
pairwise comparisons in this window, analysing high
and low Conscientiousness group separately. They
revealed that, remarkably, there was a significant main
effect of Correctness regardless of the region in 400-
500 ms window for those higher in Conscientiousness
( = -1.311 V, p = .015), but not for those lower in Conscientiousness ( = -.420, p = .380). Nonetheless, visual
inspection still showed an apparent LAN component
for lower Conscientiousness, though restricted to
frontal electrodes (F3, F1, Fz, F2, and F4). Indeed,
ANOVA analyses exclusively at these five anterior electrodes yielded a significant correctness effect (F(1,13) =
4.75, p = .048, h2p = .268,  = .523). Overall, although not
a highly robust finding, the LAN appeared significantly
reduced in participants with lower Conscientiousness.
Similarly, In the 400-500 ms interval the linear model
analyses yielded significant results for Correctness by
Conscientiousness and a region by Conscientiousness
interactions (all ps < .05) (Appendix 1). Linear tendencies
showed that, especially in anterior regions, the component amplitude tended to be smaller for low
Conscientiousness than for high Conscientiousness
(Figure 6).
The repeated ANOVA yielded a significant Region by
Correctness by Conscientiousness interaction (F(2,18) =
4.65, p = .048, h2p = .341,  = .549). Post-hoc pairwise analyses revealed that the P600 amplitude (that is, the
difference between incorrect and correct waves) was significantly larger for participants lower in Conscientiousness ( = 1.59, p = .027) than those higher in this trait.

Discussion
The present study aimed to investigate how the dimensions of personality postulated by the Big Five model

modulate syntax processing in the presence or
absence of a confederate. As such, following a
summary of the overall results, we will focus this discussion on traits by correctness effects.
In regard to the question of whether personality interacts with behavioural measures, a linear mixed model of
behavioural data indicated that whereas higher

376

L. JIMENEZ-ORTEGA ET AL.

Neuroticism was related to more incorrect answers and
longer reaction times, higher Extraversion levels was
associated with smaller error rates and shorter reaction
times. In addition, higher levels of Conscientiousness
were associated with longer reaction times. Interestingly, in regard to psychophysiological measures, we
found that lower Extraversion and higher Openness
groups showed significantly higher arousal in the
social condition than when alone.
As for the ERP results, findings showed that the traits
Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness
seemed to have interacted in syntactic processing
modulations, though to different degrees. The high
Extraversion group triggered a clear LAN component
both in social and alone conditions, although it was
only statistically significant in the social condition.
However, the low Extraversion group in the social condition triggered a weaker and more posterior negative
component, resembling an N400 component (main
component activity is around P2 and CP2 electrodes),
compared to when alone (main component activity is
around F3 electrode). The low Conscientiousness
group triggered a weaker and more restricted LAN and
a larger P600 than those higher in Conscientiousness,
and moreover, linear model analyses indicated that
lower levels of Conscientiousness were associated with
a smaller LAN component. Lastly, linear model analyses
also revealed an interaction between social presence
conditions, sentence correctness and Agreeableness.
However, linear trends suggested a complex relationship between these variables.
The behavioural data seem to indicate that personality traits may affect decision-making and error detection,
in that higher levels of Neuroticism were linked not only
with more incorrect answers (higher error rates), but also
with taking longer to make a decision about the correctness of the sentence. Along these lines, high levels of
Neuroticism have been previously related to poor
decision-making and low self-esteem (Denburg et al.,
2009; Lauriola & Levin, 2009; Uziel, 2010). One explanation might be that those participants more prone to
feelings of anxiety or nervousness may experience
greater distress when observing morphosyntactic
anomalies, resulting in a poorer performance. This
interpretation is in line with Hubert and Jarvikivi
(Hubert, 2020; Hubert & Jarvikivi, 2019, 24-27 july).
dark forces in language comprehension: the case of
neuroticism and disgust in a pupillometry study proceedings of the 41st annual meeting of the cognitive
science society, montreal, qc) findings, where they
observed that greater pupil dilatation was associated
with higher Neuroticism levels and vice versa in an auditory language comprehension task including

morphosyntactic anomalies. The interactions between
both Extraversion and Conscientiousness with behavioural effects will be discussed below in relation with
ERP findings.
Interestingly, the ERP interactions between Extraversion, syntactic processing, and social condition, were
partially in line with behavioural and skin conductance
findings. The pattern of larger error rates and longer
reaction times associated with lower Extraversion is particularly noteworthy, given that the low Extraversion
group also presented higher skin conductance levels
and, remarkably, triggered a weaker and more positive
early syntactic component in the social condition.
Judging by the positive correlation between Extraversion and high self-esteem that some authors have
noted (Robins et al., 2009; Uziel, 2010), it is plausible
that introversion may potentially be related to lower
self-esteem, in which case introverts might have a
more aversive reaction to social presence. Indeed,
under the assumption that arousal reflects alertness or
readiness in response to the uncertainty that the other
person poses, as is posited by the monitoring theory
of social facilitation (Guerin, 1993; Guerin & Innes,
1982), this increased arousal may indicate increased
need to monitor for potential threats. Moreover, if introverted participants tended to be more distracted or
affected by the confederate's presence, perhaps this
led to a starker division of attentional resources
between the social presence and the syntactic error,
resulting in larger error rates, reaction times and a
weaker syntactic component. This might also explain
why the distribution of the LAN in the social presence
condition looks more like an N400 distribution for introverts. It has been proposed that this type of N400-like
distribution in response to syntactic anomalies reflects
"the use of alternative strategies to solve these
anomalies" (Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2011), likely
appearing in response to syntactic information when
lexico-semantic information processing is required
(Molinaro et al., 2011). The more lexico-semantic information is processed, the more N400-like the distribution
of the negativity to syntactic agreement violations will
be (Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2011; Mancini et al.,
2011; Molinaro et al., 2015). Accordingly, the change in
the processing strategy triggered by social presence in
introverts could be the result of a more heuristic-like
or associative processing style, which does not take all
available information into account but rather relies on
previous knowledge and shortcuts. The heuristic processing style is typically more characteristic of lexicosemantics operations instead of the algorithmic, highly
detailed, systematic and rule-based strategy expected
for morphosyntactic violations (Hinchcliffe et al., 2020;

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

Martin-Loeches et al., 2009; Vissers et al., 2013). In a previous study, an N400-like component instead of a LAN
was observed when the participant was accompanied
by a confederate while judging syntactic anomalies
(Hinchcliffe et al., 2020). Our results might indicate that
introverts could be the main contributors to the shift
observed in the component's topography. Furthermore,
behavioural results show less accuracy and longer reaction times associated with lower levels of Extraversion.
Accordingly, the heuristic strategies used by introverts,
which in other contexts might be an index of creativity
and flexibility (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Zhou et al.,
2018), seem to be less efficient in detecting morphosyntactic anomalies given the intrinsic nature of the task,
requiring a detailed, more systematic approach
(Martin-Loeches et al., 2009; Vissers et al., 2013).
In regard to Agreeableness, linear model analyses and
trends suggested a complex interaction between this
trait with correctness and presence. Whereas lower
levels of Agreeableness seemed to correspond to a
more negative component, larger values seemed to
trigger a positive component for all ROIS except for
the left anterior one. In the alone condition, this
pattern seem to appear only in posterior regions,
whereas in the social condition it occurred in almost
all regions of interest. However, the results are ultimately
too complex to draw a clear conclusion as to how Agreeableness might affect language comprehension in the
social condition. In addition, ANOVA analyses using
high and low Agreeableness groups did not yield
neither tendencies nor statistically significant results.
Thus, in order to confirm these results, future research
should include more subjects or maybe a design
focused on this trait.
Perhaps the most notable findings from the present
study were that Conscientiousness appeared involved
in aspects of early and late syntactic processing.
Although the results of the overall ANOVA have not
been as statistically robust as in the post-hoc including
just Conscientiousness, a clear pattern arises when also
taking into account the model analyses and topographic
maps (See Figure 6). Those lower in Conscientiousness
revealed smaller LAN and greater P600 components,
whereas those higher in Conscientiousness presented
a more prominent LAN and a smaller P600 component.
This pattern has been previously described, where
good comprehenders (i.e. participants with better
working memory capacities) showed a larger LAN/
reduced P600 in comparison to bad comprehenders
(individuals with lower working memory capacity)
(Coulson & Kutas, 2001; King & Kutas, 1995; Tanner &
Van Hell, 2014). The same pattern appears when
emotional information precedes a sentence containing

377

a morphosyntatic violation, compared to neutral information (Espuny et al., 2018). The increased LAN /
reduced P600 pattern is therefore generally interpreted
as a result of a more efficient processing of syntactic
information. In addition, the present study found that
the higher the level of Conscientiousness, the longer
the reaction times. However, since this trait did not correspond with larger error rates, as occurred in the case of
Neuroticism, it might indicate a more thorough processing, resulting in a larger syntactic component.
High Conscientiousness has been associated with
self-discipline, self-control, competitiveness and being
remarkably rule-abiding (Jackson & Roberts, 2017;
Stock & Beste, 2015). Syntactic processing has been considered as mainly algorithmic and rule-based, "following
a finite list of well-defined instructions about how lexical
elements combine to form phrases and sentences" (Friederici & Weissenborn, 2007; Martin-Loeches et al., 2009).
The rule-abiding tendency characteristic of high Conscientiousness might favour syntactic processing,
making it more thorough and efficient, as occurs in
good comprehenders. An alternative/complementary
explanation might be that Conscientiousness was
associated with superior executive functioning, particularly as this trait seems to be related to the attention
shifting or switching component of executive function
(Fleming et al., 2016), which might also contribute to
the increase of performance for high Conscientiousness
observed in the present study.
Together, the present data indicate influences of personality on language comprehension. Nonetheless,
several limitations should be addressed in future
research. Although the sample size met the average
requirements for neuroimaging studies, in order to get
an even fuller picture of individual differences future
studies should include at least the recommended
amount of 40 participants (Yarkoni, 2010). In addition,
behavioural prescreening can achieve a power boost
comparable to larger sample sizes without inflating the
false positive rate (de Haas, 2018). As suggested above,
creating groups of subjects focusing in one trait by
using pre-screening might have several statistical and
methodological advantages. Additionally, the majority
of participants were females favouring sample homogeneity, but further research should explore possible
gender effects. Regardless of the limitation of the
sample, our study fulfils many of the recommendations
made by Yarkoni and Braver (2020), such as homogeneous sample, the use of a task known to produce
consistent changes in ERP with performance levels
above 80 of accuracy, and behavioural data measurements. In addition, effect size and power calculations
were provided when possible. Therefore, regardless of

378

L. JIMENEZ-ORTEGA ET AL.

its size limitations, this study may provide a good initial
starting point for future research on how extra-linguistic
information like personality and social presence affect
language comprehension.

Conclusion
Personality has been noted as a potential mediator of
social presence effects as well as of various cognitive processes. The present study aimed to measure the relationship between personality, as measured by the NEO-FFI,
and language ERPs as participants responded to syntactic
anomalies, once alone and once in the presence of a confederate. While it must be considered that a larger sample
of participants might increase robustness of the findings,
the results indicate that Extraversion, Conscientiousness
and likely also Agreeableness may have intervened to
some degree in syntactic processing. Additionally,
future studies could further investigate this question by
choosing larger samples and/or prescreened samples
that are specifically high, medium and low in each trait.
On the other hand, the results of the present study
imply that even in a sample with a relatively normal distribution of scores on each trait, there still seem to be
effects of personality differences on components of syntactic language comprehension. Findings of this type
indicate that the brain's language processing system consider extralinguistic factors as relevant information, and
that this is the case even for syntactic processing, traditionally considered as encapsulated (Fodor, 1983;
Hauser et al., 2002). Importantly, our results highlight
the utility of considering personality traits and social
context as relevant factors modulating language comprehension, adding to recent and yet incomplete evidence in
this respect.
