Abstract
The present investigation examined the effect of perfectionism on metacognitive listening
strategy (MLS) use through the components of self-efficacy (initiative, effort, and persistence) among a sample of 117 Iranian English as a Foreign Language university students.
Cluster analysis was utilized to identify the perfectionistic clusters. The resulting analysis
yielded a three-cluster solution (adaptive, maladaptive, and non-perfectionist). Multicategorical multiple mediation analysis was then used to explore the relative direct, indirect,
and total effects and to test the postulated hypotheses of the study. Results indicated that
adaptive perfectionism was associated with higher levels of effort and persistence, leading to greater MLS use. Regarding the initiative subscale, no significant differences were
observed among the three perfectionist groups. Maladaptive perfectionists showed high
levels of effort investment but not persistence. Mediation analysis did not support self-efficacy components as the mediators of the relationship between perfectionism and MLS use.
Among self-efficacy components, only effort exerted a positive effect on MLS use. Results
are discussed in terms of implications for future research and classroom practice.

Introduction
In recent decades, metacognitive listening strategy (MLS) use has been one of the major
interesting subjects in second language acquisition research and there is a large volume of
published studies describing metacognitive strategy use in listening skill development (e.g.

Xu and Huang 2018; Bozorgian and Alamdari 2018; Vandergrift and Tafaghodtari 2010;
Goh 2008; Vandergrift 2004). A key issue pertinent to the effective application of metacognitive strategies on the part of the learners is its inter-individually variable nature due
to a plethora of psychological, social, and contextual factors at play. Specifically, learners
may exhibit different levels of metacognitive strategy use according to their psychological
propensities that may vary from learner to learner (Goh 2008). Therefore, research on MLS
use demands an in-depth analysis of individual differences in psychological predispositions
and personality attributes.
In particular, among personality factors, perfectionism as a multidimensional personality construct can offer a promising path towards understanding individual differences
across different levels of functioning and performance (Barabadi and Khajavy 2020; Hanchon 2010). Ironically, early conceptualizations of perfectionism conceived of the construct as an adverse detrimental personality trait leading to language learning anxiety and
difficulties in language learning (Flett et al. 2016). Later on, however, research showed perfectionism as a dynamic concept with numerous facets; a Janus-faced construct (Hawkins
2005) and a double-edged sword (Stoeber 2014) that can render both adaptive and maladaptive faces.
What is not yet clear is the impacts that perfectionism may exert on MLS due to its
multidimensional nature. This is partially due to the lack of comprehensive theoretical or
reliable empirical evidence establishing the conceptual links between perfectionism and
MLS. Nonetheless, given the absence of an established theory between MLS and perfectionism, recent research suggests that both constructs are theoretically linked to the concept
of self-efficacy (Chon and Shin 2019; Gutierrez-Braojos 2015; Vandergrift 2005; Flavell
1979). Self-efficacy in L2 listening is directly linked to the metacognitive category of person knowledge (Vandergrift et al. 2006). Therefore, it would be plausible to establish a link
between perfectionism and MLS use through self-efficacy.
By extension, self-efficacy plays important roles in academic expectations, achievements, and strategy use (Sparks and Ganschow 2001). General self-efficacy is regarded as
a personal resource that refers to the optimistic self-belief in one's competence to exercise
control over a range of difficult tasks and to generally cope well with adverse events (Deuling and Burns 2017). Moreover, "Because self-efficacy involves a cognitive appraisal of
one's abilities, it is particularly well-suited to the scenario of being perfectionistic [emphasis added] and failing to meet one's standards" (Bardone-Conea et al. 2006, p. 29). Besides,
according to Flett et al. (2016), cognitive tendencies along with personal and social representations of perfectionism within individual differences in self-efficacy framework can
affect language learning and emotional self-regulation. Accordingly, being perfectionist is
in relation with one's self-efficacy and meeting their standards. Self-efficacy highlights the
ways perfectionism affects the success or failure of an individual's performance (Deuling
and Burns 2017). According to Bandura and Cervone (1986, as cited in Bardone-Conea
et al. 2006), low self-efficacy and high self-efficacy are linked to one's perceived standards
and their attainments.
Considering these findings, we can deduce how essential it is to examine the individual
differences in psychological and motivational mechanisms that account for the variations in
metacognitive listening strategy (MLS) use among language learners. From this notion, it
is inferred that self-efficacy may mediate the relationship between perfectionism and MLS
use. Although previous research has consistently showed extensive theoretical and empirical connections between self-efficacy and perfectionism as well as self-efficacy and MLS
use, no single study, to the best of our knowledge, has been carried out on the constructs
altogether. Furthermore, a careful study of the literature reveals that the main aspects of the

13

present investigation have not been thoroughly addressed in an Iranian context. Therefore,
the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual theoretical framework by proposing a mediational model examining the effects of perfectionism on MLS use through the
mediating role of self-efficacy components among an Iranian sample of language learners.
In the following sections, first theoretical as well as empirical background to the study
is presented. Subsequently, based on the evidence gathered from previous literature, a theoretical model is proposed and the hypotheses are postulated to address different aspects of
the effects that perfectionism may exert on MLS use.

Theoretical Background
Perfectionism and Second Language Acquisition
As a predisposition towards achieving the ideal possible personal standards (Gnilka and
Novakovic 2017), perfectionism has been extensively investigated in the realm of individual differences, personality, and educational psychology research (Stewart and GeorgeWalker 2014). Major studies in the literature have utilized a clustering approach to interpret
perfectionism as a multidimensional personality attribute. The clusters include adaptive,
maladaptive and non-perfectionist groups (Mills and Blankstein 2000). Perfectionism with
this tripartite framework has been regarded as the antecedent variable predicting an outcome variable through relevant mediating factors (Deuling and Burns 2017). Adaptive perfectionism is related to setting idealistic high personal standards and making less mistakes.
Adaptive perfectionism is also associated with higher levels of self-efficacy and adaptive
cognitive learning strategies. Maladaptive perfectionism on the other hand is linked to maladjusted personality disorders, inflexible self-evaluations, overabundant concern over mistakes, and doubts about actions. Both adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists are inclined
to set idealistic goals to arrive at an unmatched level of performance in an attempt to attain
excellence in a given task by avoiding errors (Seo 2008). Non-perfectionism, on the other
hand, is linked to low levels of personal standards, order, doubts about action, and concern
over mistakes.
Regarding the investigations done on perfectionism in second language acquisition
(SLA) research, there is a growing interest in the field. Perfectionism has been investigated
in relation with both language teachers (Jones 2016; Mahmoodi-Shahrebabaki 2017) and
learners (Dashtizadeh and Farvardin 2016; Flett et al. 2016; GhorbanDordinejad and Nasab
2013; Gregersen and Horwitz 2002). Studies carried out on learners have mainly ventured
into productive language skills. Studies on productive skills have depicted that maladaptive perfectionism and excessive concern over accuracy mistakes would rob the learners of
communicative language production (Kang 2006; Yoshida 2013). Maladaptive perfectionism would also lead to fluency problems. As a result, the learners may turn into passive
participants (Liu and Jackson 2008).
While consistent studies concerning perfectionism and L2 Listening comprehension are
lacking, there are still some notable examples. For instance, Pishghadam and Akhoondpoor
(2011), utilizing a unidimensional self-report scale along with measures of trait and state
anxiety, investigated perfectionism and anxiety in relation with reading, writing, speech,
and listening performance. Pishghadam and Akhoondpoor found small but significant
associations between elevated perfectionism and lower levels of reading, speaking, and listening performance.

Perfectionism has also been an object of study in terms of its relationship with learning
strategies and specifically metacognitive strategies. As an example, Amini and Shamlou
(2014), in a quasi-experimental study, examined the effect of metacognitive strategy training and perfectionism on bottom-up and top-down listening comprehension sub-processes.
A significant effect was observed with perfectionists being more favored by metacognitive
instruction than their non-perfectionist counterparts. The authors concluded that L2 listening processes were better explained through the analysis of the interaction between perfectionism and top-down/bottom-up processes.
Mills and Blankstein (2000) explored perfectionism, intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation,
and motivated strategies for learning. According to the results, self-oriented perfectionism
was significantly and positively associated with self-efficacy for learning, performance,
adaptive metacognitive, and cognitive learning strategies. Socially prescribed perfectionism was associated negatively with these measures.

SelfEfficacy, Perfectionism, and Second Language Listening Comprehension
As a motivational construct, self-efficacy is related to a tendency towards initiating specific
behaviors, exerting effort to fulfill a task, and exhibiting persistence in the face of adversity and conflict (Deuling and Burns 2017). Explicated by Bandura (1997), self-efficacy
refers to the students' self-belief in their capabilities to accomplish specific tasks. Typically, self-efficacy contributes to optimal effort investment (Gutierrez-Braojos 2015; Ziegler and Opdenakker 2018), better use of self-regulatory metacognitive strategies, longer
persistence, and higher academic performance (Goudarzi et al. 2014; Seo 2008). Low levels of self-efficacy, on the other hand, are associated with task avoidance, low levels of
initiation, persistence, and weak self-regulated performance (Bandura 1986). Self-efficacy
has also been theoretically and empirically linked to perfectionism (Stoeber et al. 2008).
It has been also studied in mediational studies as a mediator variable connecting predictor
variables to perfectionism as an outcome variable (e.g. Deuling and Burns 2017; Stewart
and George-Walker 2014). Studies available in the literature have indicated positive links
between self-efficacy and adaptive perfectionism and negative associations between selfefficacy components and maladaptive perfectionism.
Empirical research on self-efficacy also suggests a link between self-efficacy and listening comprehension (Mills et al. 2006; Graham 2011). Specifically, self-efficacy has been
investigated in relation with metacognitive listening strategy use (Yabukoshi 2018). This
line of studies has confirmed positive effects of self-efficacy on self-regulatory metacognitive strategy use in L2 listening comprehension.

The Review of Related Literature
Several studies have investigated self-efficacy as a mediator between perfectionism and a
dependent variable of interest. Stewart and George-Walker (2014) for example found no
support for self-efficacy as a mediator of the relationship between perfectionism, locus
of control, and self-handicapping. In Gnilka and Novakovic's (2017) investigation, selfefficacy mediated the relationship between both dimensions of perfectionism and the perception of career barriers for men but not for women. Deuling and Burns (2017) investigated self-esteem and domain-specific self-efficacy as mediators of perfectionism clusters
and work/family conflict (WFC). The results indicated that adaptive perfectionists displayed high WFC self-efficacy scores while such a trend was not statistically significant in

13

1051

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2020) 49:1047-1065

maladaptive and non-perfectionist clusters. Seo (2008) investigated the link between selforiented perfectionism and academic procrastination by examining the role of self-efficacy
as a mediator in the relationship. It was found that self-efficacy fully, rather than partially,
mediated the relationship between self-oriented perfectionism and academic procrastination. Gutierrez-Braojos (2015) in a study found that self-efficacy played a mediating role
between future time perspective (FTP) and metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive strategies in turn mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and great point average (GPA).
Coutinho and Neuman (2008) proposed a model of metacognition, achievement goal orientation, learning style, and self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis
revealed that self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of performance, while metacognition
was a weak predictor of performance. Self-efficacy and metacognition played a mediatory
role in the relationship between achievement goal orientation and performance. Two indicators of performance used in this study were high school GPA and college GPA. Hrabluik
et al. (2012) tested a model with effort as a mediator of the relationship between perfectionism and exam performance. The results provided an acceptable fit to the empirical data.
Effort, in turn, was related to maximum performance in the exam.

The Present Study
The aim of this study is to shine new light on the above-mentioned debates through an
examination of the effects of perfectionism on MLS use, exploring the mediating role of
self-efficacy components among a sample of Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL)
learners. The present investigation conceives of perfectionism as a multidimensional construct and analyzes the construct in adaptive, maladaptive, and non-perfectionist clusters.
Likewise, self-efficacy is analyzed in terms of its integral components (initiative, effort,
and persistence) rather than the overall general self-efficacy. To this end, we have adopted
Complex Dynamic Systems (CDS) approach (Dornyei et al. 2015; Dornyei and Ryan
2015) as the theoretical framework of the study. As a groundbreaking theory in personality research, CDS views the variables of interest as multidimensional componential factors
within a holistic dynamic framework rather than monolithic isolated constructs. The rationale in this framework is that a thorough examination of the constructs in the light of their
interconnected subcomponents would display a more conclusive portrait of the relations
among the variables. Therefore, instead of considering perfectionism and self-efficacy as
isolated overall constructs, we have taken their dimensions and subcomponents into consideration. Utilizing the CDS approach and building upon the supporting evidence in previous research summarized above, we have proposed a hypothetical model (Fig. 1) against
which the hypotheses of the study are tested.
In summary, this study seeks to test the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1 Adaptive perfectionism (in contrast to maladaptive and non-perfectionism)
is associated with increased levels of self-efficacy components as well as MLS use.

Hypothesis 2 Perfectionism and self-efficacy components exert positive direct and total
relative effects on MLS use.

Hypothesis 3 Self-efficacy components mediate the relationship between perfectionism
and MLS use.

Method
This cross-sectional study is a part of a larger mixed-methods investigation into Iranian
EFL learners' perfectionism in relation with their self-efficacy, metacognitive listening
strategy use, and listening proficiency.

Participants
The participants of this study were 117 male (n = 46) and female (n = 71) junior (n = 57)
and senior (n = 60) Iranian EFL students majoring in English Literature and English Translation at Shahid Bahonar and Azad universities in Kerman (age range = 20-27 years old,
M = 21.03, SD = 1.36). These participants were recruited using convenience sampling. The
rationale behind selecting junior and senior students was that students at higher levels of
proficiency are perceived to have more experiences of involving in listening tasks (Goh
2008; Goh and Hu 2014; Razmi and Rastegar 2012). Furthermore, according to Vandergrift (1997) and O'Malley et al. (1989), more proficient listeners employed metacognitive strategies more frequently than the less proficient listeners. Oxford Quick Placement
Test (60 items) was conducted to ensure the participants' homogeneity with respect to the
L2 level of proficiency. Independent samples T-tests showed statistically significant differences neither between males and females, t (113) = 0,098, p > 0.05 nor between junior
and senior participants, t (113) = - 584, p > 0.05. One-way ANOVA showed no substantial differences among the three perfectionistic clusters regarding the proficiency test, F(2,
112) = 0.335, p > 0.05.
As junior and senior students, all participants in this study had taken the basic courses
for English majors (Language Laboratory I & II, Reading Comprehension I, II, & III,
Grammar I & II, Study Skills, Advanced Writing, and English Phonology). The medium
of instruction was English in all the basic courses the students had passed. It is worth

13

mentioning that in Iran, the university entrance examinations (Konkour) are administered
each year and the universities screen the students based on the students' obtained ranks on
the exams. In order to choose English subfields, the students are to sit the specialized English university entrance exam. Before university experience, the students study English for
seven consecutive years at high school. The courses and the materials are designed by the
ministry of education. In addition to these courses, many students decide to study English
in private institutes in Iran. Therefore, the students majoring in English subfields in Iran
have had adequate exposure to spoken and written English. Listening skill is an integral
part of both university and high school courses in Iran. Since all the university admissions
are determined through the university entrance examinations, a typical class of English
subfield in any university in Iran includes students from different provinces of the country;
therefore, it is safe to say that our sample represents the Iranian English major learners'
population adequately (Fallah 2014).

Measures
The following instruments were used to collect the required data:

Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire (MALQ)
MALQ was developed by Vandergrift et al. (2006). MALQ is based on a likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 6 (strongly disagree). This instrument consists of 21 items.
There are five distinctive subscales in this questionnaire, namely problem-solving, planning
and evaluation, mental translation, person knowledge, and directed attention. In order to
validate the subscales in the instrument, the developers used the questionnaire with nearly
1,000 learners from various countries including Iran. Accordingly, the reliabilities of the
subscales were: problem-solving: 0.74, planning and evaluation: 0.75, mental translation:
0.78, person knowledge: 0.74, and directed attention: 0.68. In the present study, following the scoring method presented by the developers of the instrument, mental translation
(items 12, 13, & 14) was scored negatively and the and two items of person knowledge
(items 3 and 8) and one item of directed attention (item 16) were reverse coded.

General SelfEfficacy Scale (GSES12)
Developed by Bosscher and Smit (1998), GSES-12 is a 12-item questionnaire scored on a
5-point likert scale (from 1 = disagree to 5 = agree). The instrument is a modified version
of General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) developed by Sherer et al. (1982). GSES-12 measures three subscales, namely initiative, effort, and persistence. Bosscher and Smit (1998)
reported the reliabilities of the overall general self-efficacy and subscales as follows: overall GSES-12: 0.69, initiative: 0.64, effort: 0.63, and persistence: 0.64.

Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS)
The MPS is a 35-item questionnaire developed by Frost et al. (1990) to measure perfectionism. It is based on a likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
There are six subscales in this questionnaire. They are scored by summing up the scores
given to the items. The subscales are: Concern over Mistakes (CM), Personal Standards
(PS), Parental Expectations (PE), Parental Criticism (PC), Doubting of actions (D), and

13

1054

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2020) 49:1047-1065

Organization (O). Hawkins (2005) reported the internal consistency alpha values of MPS
as follows: Overall perfectionism measure: 0.90, CM: 0.88, PS: 0.83, PE: 0.84, PC: 0.84,
D: 0.77, and O: 0.93.

Procedure
In addition to demographic information, Oxford Quick Placement Test, MALQ, GSES-12,
and MPS scales were distributed among the participants simultaneously. Participants were
given time (20-25 min) to fill in the English versions of these questionnaires and there
were accompanying instructions. The participants were assured that the information would
be kept completely confidential. They were also told that the gathered information would
be used only for research purposes. They were reminded that participation was entirely voluntary. The participants were treated in accordance with APA ethical guidelines throughout the whole data collection procedures. Students that agreed to participate in the study,
completed the survey in their regular class time.
Prior to data collection, the researchers obtained written institutional consent from the
corresponding foreign languages departments and verbal consent from the English professors. Students volunteered to participate for extra course credit. The questionnaires were
administered in seven classes within three weeks during the first semester in 2018-2019
academic year. Each participant was given a code for further data collection procedures.

Analytic Plan
Having gathered the data, we conducted a two-step cluster analysis procedure to identify
perfectionism clusters. Cluster analysis yielded a three-cluster solution (adaptive, maladaptive, and non-perfectionist groups). The descriptive statistics of the variables of the present
investigation in terms of the perfectionist clusters are displayed in Table 2. The preliminary statistical analyses were run to present a clear description of the primary relationships
among the variables of the study. Since the antecedent independent variable (perfectionism
clusters) was categorical, we used PROCESS v. 3.2 (Hayes 2018) to conduct a multicategorical mediation analysis. The results then were used to test the postulated hypotheses
of the present investigation. All the statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 25.

Results
Perfectionism Clusters
There is a growing body of research in the literature supporting the use of cluster analysis
in identification of perfectionist types (e.g. Deuling and Burns 2017; GhorbanDordinejad
and Nasab 2013; Hawkins 2005; Parker 1997; Rice and Mirzadeh 2000). Conceptually,
cluster analysis is similar to factor analysis with the exception that while factor analysis
yields groupings of variables to summarize the data into common factors, cluster analysis yields groupings of participants and people based on similar scorings on the variables
(Rice and Mirzadeh 2000). The use of cluster analysis in the above-mentioned studies has
depicted three different types of perfectionism, namely adaptive perfectionism, maladaptive

13

perfectionism, and non-perfectionism. This typology was first proposed by Parker (1997).
Following Parker's (1997) strategy, we used a two-step cluster analysis procedure (hierarchical and non-hierarchical) to identify the perfectionistic groups based on the participants'
obtained scores on the six dimensions of MPS questionnaire (Table 1).
Following this procedure, three interpretable clusters emerged. Out of 117 participants, 29 students (24.8%) belonged to non-perfectionist (Pn) group, 36 students (30.8%)
belonged to maladaptive perfectionist (P-) group, and 52 students (44.4%) belonged to
adaptive perfectionist (P+) group. The frequency distribution and the descriptive statistics
of perfectionism have been shown in Table 1.
As indicated in Table 1, non-perfectionists obtained the lowest mean scores on all six
MPS subscales (Cluster 1). Maladaptive perfectionists (Cluster 2) obtained the highest
mean scores on CM, D, and PC. Adaptive perfectionists (Cluster 3) obtained the highest
mean scores on organization. There were no statistically significant differences between
adaptive and maladaptive clusters regarding the mean scores on PS.

Preliminary Analyses
Descriptive statistics for EFL learners' perfectionism, initiative, effort, persistence and
MLS are presented in Table 2. With respect to the first hypothesis, which postulated that
higher levels of adaptive perfectionism (in contrast to maladaptive and non-perfectionism)
are associated with increased levels of self-efficacy components, several one-way ANOVA
analyses were launched. According to the results, there were no significant differences
among perfectionistic groups regarding the scores obtained from the initiative self-efficacy
subscale, F (2, 114) = 0.381, p > 0.05.
Concerning the effort subscale, Adaptive perfectionists (M = 23.25, SD = 1.67) and maladaptive perfectionists (M = 22.52, SD = 1.64) reported significantly higher scores as compared to non-perfectionist participants (M = 9, SD = 1.64), F (2, 114) = 771.27, p < 0.05.
Student-Newman-Keuls (S-N-K) post-hoc test showed no significant differences between
adaptive and maladaptive perfectionist groups for the effort measures.

Differences in EFL learners' perfectionistic group membership concerning the persistence measures were statistically significant, F (2, 114) = 625.51, p < 0.05. S-N-K
post-hoc test indicated that the adaptive perfectionist group (M = 17.96, SD = 1.86)
had significantly higher levels of persistence compared to maladaptive perfectionists (M = 9.38, SD = 1.12) and non-perfectionists (M = 6.58, SD = 1.23). The difference
between maladaptive perfectionists and non-perfectionists in persistence was also statistically significant.
Concerning the MLS differences in the three perfectionistic groups, significant differences were found, F (2, 114) = 361.47, p < 0.05. Adaptive perfectionists reported
the highest level of metacognitive strategy use (M = 110.75, SD = 9.22) compared to
maladaptive perfectionists (M = 77.61, SD = 4.65) and non-perfectionists (M = 55.44,
SD = 12.79). S-N-K post hoc test showed significant differences among the three perfectionistic groups.
Correlational analyses (Table 3) and multiple regression analyses were launched
to establish the statistically significant relationships between the proposed mediators (initiative, effort, and persistence) and the dependent variable (MLS). The three
self-efficacy subscales were simultaneously entered as predictors. Effort ( = 0.287,
p < 0.05) and persistence ( = 0.707, p < 0.05) showed adaptive relations with MLS, F
(3, 113) = 215.96, p < 0.05, R2 = 0.851. Initiative did not predict MLS variance.

Multiple Mediation Analysis
In order to analyze self-efficacy components as mediators of the relationship between perfectionism clusters and MLS we followed the procedures by Hayes and Preacher (2014).
PROCESS Procedure for SPSS Version 3.2 (Hayes 2018) was utilized to analyze the data.
Since the antecedent predictor variable (perfectionism clusters) is categorical, we used
multicategorical multiple mediation analysis (Model 4 in Hayes 2018) to probe the indirect effects of perfectionism clusters on MLS through the self-efficacy subscales entered
simultaneously.
Mediation analysis allows the evaluation of direct and indirect effects of one mediator
along with the effects of all other mediators in the model. This advanced technique is contingent on the selection of the contrast codes when the antecedent variable is a categorical
one (Hayes and Preacher 2014). In Mediation analysis, point estimates for indirect effects
are demonstrated to be significant if at least one 95% confidence interval (CI) does not
straddle zero (Hayes 2018).
Following the mediation analysis procedures, point estimates and percentile confidence
intervals of total and specific relative indirect effects were estimated based on 10,000 bootstrapped samples. To test the hypotheses, initiative, effort, and persistence were entered
simultaneously as mediators of perfectionism with orthogonal contrast codes (Helmert
coding system, Hayes 2018) for perfectionism. Two dummy-coded variables (D1 and D2)

were created for the purpose of multiple mediation analysis. Specifically, D1: Pn versus
P+ & P- represents non-perfectionism compared to adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism clusters (Pn = - 0.67; P- = 0.33; and P+ = 0.333); and D2: P+ versus P- denotes maladaptive perfectionism compared to adaptive perfectionism cluster (Pn = 0; P- = - 0.50; and
P= 0.50). The mediation analysis is presented in Fig. 2 and Table 4.
In order to test the first hypothesis, postulating that higher levels of adaptive perfectionism are associated with increased levels of self-efficacy components, the direct effects
of D1 and D2 perfectionism contrasts on self-efficacy were explored (Fig. 2). In mediation analysis, a represents the direct effects of a multicategorical antecedent variable on
the mediators in a model (Hayes 2018). As indicated in Table 4, D1 contrast (non-perfectionism vs. maladaptive and adaptive perfectionism) exerted significant direct effects
on effort (D1: a2 = 13.88**, t = 38.87, p < 0.01), 95% CI [13.18, 14.59] and persistence
(D1: a3 = 7.08**, t = 21.60, p < 0.01), 95% CI [6.43, 7.73], but not on the initiative subscale (D1: a1 = 0.237, t = 0.868, p > 0.05), 95% CI [- 0.304, 0.779]. D2 contrast (adaptive
perfectionism versus maladaptive perfectionism) followed the same pattern. D2 contrast
showed significant direct effects on effort (D2: a2 = 0.722*, t = 2.00, p < 0.05), 95% CI

13

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2020) 49:1047-1065

[0.008, 1.43] and persistence (D2: a3 = 8.57**, t = 21.60, p < 0.01), 95% CI [7.91, 9.22],
and not a statistically significant direct effect on the initiative (D2: a1 = 0.002, t = 0.007,
p > 0.05), 95% CI [- 0.544, 0.548]. According to the findings in the mediation analysis and
in line with the preliminary analyses mentioned above, perfectionistic groups did not differ
in the initiative subscale. In contrast, perfectionistic clusters showed significant differences
in the effort and persistence self-efficacy subscales. Adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists outperformed non-perfectionists in the effort subscale. There were no significant differences between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists in the effort subscale. Regarding the
persistence subscale, adaptive perfectionists obtained significantly higher scores compared
to the maladaptive and non-perfectionist groups. Maladaptive perfectionists outperformed
the non-perfectionists in the persistence self-efficacy subscale.
The second hypothesis, which postulated that adaptive perfectionism and self-efficacy components exert adaptive direct influences on MLS use, was partially supported.
c represents the relative direct effect of D1 and D2 contrasts on MLS use. c quantifies
the direct effect of perfectionism contrasts on MLS without passing through the mediator variables. In terms of D1, the relative direct effect was not statistically significant (D1:
c = 11.259, t = 1.46, p > 0.05), 95% CI [- 4.00, 26.52]. D2 contrast, however, was found
to exert a significant effect on the MLS use (D2: c' = 25.41**, t = 5.02, p < 0.01), 95% CI
[15.38, 35.44]. c represents the relative total effect of perfectionism contrasts (D1 and D2)
on MLS use. The relative total direct effect for a contrast is the sum of its relative direct
effect and the product of the direct (a) and indirect (b) effects on the dependent variable
(c = c + ab, Hayes 2018). In both D1 and D2 contrasts, the relative total effects of perfectionism on MLS were statistically significant (D1: c = 38.73**, t = 19.55, p < 0.01, 95%
CI [34.80, 42.65], D2: c = 33.13**, t = 16.58, p < 0.01, 95% CI [29.18, 37.09]). Regarding
the direct effects of self-efficacy components on MLS use, the findings indicated that only
effort exerted a positive effect on MLS use (b = 1.60**, t = 19.55, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.55,
2.65]). Initiative and persistence were not found to render significant effects on MLS use
(Table 4).
The third hypothesis, which predicted that the impact of perfectionism on MLS was
mediated through self-efficacy components, was not supported by findings from the multiple mediation analysis (Table 4). That is because of the fact that in all mediation cases
reported in Table 4, the 95% confidence intervals for all relative indirect effects (ab) contained zero. Caution needs to be practiced here. When CI straddles zero, it is not necessarily an indication of zero effect. As Hayes (2018) maintains: "The fact that a confidence
interval for an effect contains zero does not mean the effect is zero. It merely means that
zero is in the realm of possibility, or that one cannot say with certainty what the direction of the effect is." (Hayes 2018, p. 185). To be on the safe side, we do not consider the
mediation relationships as significant.

Discussion
The present study tested three hypotheses. With respect to the first hypothesis, all three perfectionist groups performed almost the same on the initiative self-efficacy subscale. This
unique finding is in contrast to findings reported by Chang et al. (2016), Mills and Blankstein (2000), and Beauregard (2012), which conclude that adaptive perfectionists tend to
be more prepared, more willing to initiate the tasks, and utilize more productive learning
strategies. This contradictory result in our study is partly due to the fact that perfectionism

13

1060

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2020) 49:1047-1065

can influence self-efficacy to various degrees depending on context in which the individual
has to deal with different learning tasks (O'Sullivan and Strauser 2009).
Perfectionists in our study showed to invest higher amounts of effort compared to the
non-perfectionists. Research has provided evidence to support the conceptual links between
higher levels of perfectionism and the effort the students exert in learning activities. This
finding is in line with the body of research carried out in different disciplinary contexts
(Stoeber and Eysenck 2008; Stoeber and Eisman 2007) while in contrast with Harper et al.
(2016) study in which perfectionism did not predict effort. We have reason to believe that
the discrepancy in the relationship is due to three factors: (a) effort has been investigated
within different fields such as sport (Stoeber 2014), music (Stoeber and Eismann 2007),
management and workplace (Hrabluik et al. 2012), and language learning, (b) effort has
been defined under different theoretical conceptualizations such as, self-efficacy, self-handicapping (Kearns et al. 2007), metacognition, perfectionism (Stoeber 2014) to name but a
few, (c) effort has been investigated through different measurement tools such as self-report
questionnaires, subjective self-ratings, time spent practicing (Stoeber and Eismann 2007).
All these three reasons imply there is a need for further longitudinal as well as causal
research to determine the true nature of effort and its relationship with other conceptualizations at play.
Adaptive perfectionist in this study outperformed both maladaptive and non-perfectionists in the persistence self-efficacy subscale. This finding echoes the positive impact of
adaptive perfectionism on persistence and is in line with, Stoeber and Corr's (2015, 2017))
findings. The findings imply that maladaptive perfectionists might invest high amounts of
effort in listening activities; however, due to high levels of personal standards and concern over mistakes, they do not hold on to the tasks. This would be detrimental in dealing
with the listening skill challenges available in many standardized listening assessments that
demand high levels of persistence.
Concerning the second hypothesis, regarding the relative and total direct effects of perfectionism contrasts and self-efficacy subscales on MLS, perfectionism showed significant
total direct effects on MLS use. Adaptive perfectionists were better MLS users compared
to the maladaptive and non-perfectionist groups. This finding supports the findings in Mills
and Blankstein (2000), Amini and Shamlou (2014), Rostami et al. (2017) which conclude
adaptive perfectionism is associated with higher levels of metacognitive strategies. Effort
was the only self-efficacy subscale that showed a significant direct effect on the MLS use in
the mediation analysis. This finding supports Mills and Blankstein's (2000) statement that
maladaptive perfectionism leads to lower investment of effort, and that consequently leads
to lower levels of metacognition.
With reference to the third hypothesis of the study, the results did not support the mediating role of self-efficacy components in the relationship between perfectionism and MLS
use. This final finding of our study is similar to the one reported by Stewart and GeorgeWalker (2014). On the other hand, several notable investigations have found self-efficacy
either as a fully or partially significant mediating variable related to an outcome variable
(e.g. Coutinho and Neuman 2008; Deuling and Burns 2017; Gnilka and Novakovic 2017;
Gutierrez-Braojos 2015; Hrabluik et al. 2012; Seo 2008).
Finally, the inclusion of CDS approach as the theoretical framework in the present
investigation yielded an interesting result. As explained above, CDS considers the variables of interest as multidimensional components within a holistic dynamic framework
rather than monolithic isolated constructs. The results indicated that while the correlational
analyses of the main constructs yielded statistically significant effects, the inclusion of the
subcomponents of the constructs in a multicategorical mediation analysis did not depict

13

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2020) 49:1047-1065

1061

any significant results and the mediation analysis in our study was non-significant. Therefore, the inclusion of subcomponents of variables provides a more detailed explanation
regarding the relationships among the constructs under study.

Conclusion
This study aimed at investigating the impact of multidimensional perfectionism on MLS
use through the self-efficacy components. Our findings generally advocate the positive
effect of adaptive perfectionism, effort, and persistence on MLS use. Following these findings, the teachers, administrators, and learners should be aware of individual differences
in personality factors that may exert influences on second language listening performance.
In line with the noteworthy findings of the present investigation, teachers and educational
authorities in charge should instigate measures to enhance EFL learners' self-efficacy and
be ready to deal with maladaptive perfectionists and non-perfectionists so that they could
help the learners promote metacognitive learning strategies and be able to tailor those strategies to the demands of individual differences in the corresponding listening activities they
are involved in. According to Speirs Neumeister (2004), both adaptive and maladaptive
perfectionists can benefit from counseling sessions. One way therefore is to hold counseling sessions with the students and assist them in time management, the amount of effort
they need to invest in listening activities, and also discuss their perfectionistic personal
standards.
Another line of our findings highlights the substantial impact of effort on MLS use
which in turn can lead to task accomplishment in listening activities. As a teacher, it is
important to be cognizant of individual differences in the amount of effort the students
invest in listening activities. By extension, students' scores should not be taken as the sole
criteria for their performance evaluation. In other words, students should be praised for the
amount of effort they invest in learning tasks (Adelson 2007); however, an issue worthy of
note here is the students should receive instructions about the amount of effort needed to
accomplish specific listening tasks. Since perfectionism is also associated with speed and
accuracy (two important factors in dealing with listening tests) in performing tasks (Stoeber et al. 2010; Slade et al. 2009), maladaptive perfectionists with high levels of concern
over mistakes tend to exert unwanted amount of effort to be accurate at the expense of losing time and motivation to deal with the rest of the upcoming listening activities they have
no control over, and that in turn leads to lower levels of persistence. Maladaptive perfectionists therefore, end up with failure to manage their time and effort due to negative perfectionistic attitudes and lack of persistence. The role of educators in this regard is to offer
consultations on individual differences in personality factors such as perfectionism. Taken
together, adaptive perfectionism in this study showed more effort investment, persistence,
and metacognitive listening strategy use. Finally, we believe the combination of findings
of the present investigation provides some support for a conceptual premise that may hold
true not just for an Iranian context, but for a wider population across the world.
Several limitations exist with the present investigation. First, as mentioned earlier in this
study, due to space limitations, we had to report only a part of our larger investigation that
included interview sessions and a listening proficiency test, too. This study only reports
the findings based on self-report measures gathered at a single point in time using a crosssectional research design. In addition, the convenience sampling used in this research could
have created the possibility of bias that could pose a threat to the generalization of the

13

1062

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2020) 49:1047-1065

findings of the study. It will be important in subsequent research to employ longitudinal
designs as well as qualitative designs to replicate our results to help clarify the relationships between perfectionism and self-efficacy in SLA in general and L2 listening acquisition in particular. Second, following the related literature in SLA research, we measured
initiative, effort and persistence under the rubrics of self-efficacy. These components are
also defined under the classifications related to other constructs. As an example, Beri and
Jain (2016) see initiative as a construct of metacognition, while Ng (2018) takes initiative
as a concept of procrastination. Consequently, further research into the constructs of this
study utilizing other established measures is needed to elucidate the true nature of the relationships. Finally, since the present study was carried out in an Iranian EFL context, any
generalization of the findings should be practiced with caution. Thus, it is highly recommended that this study be replicated in other EFL and/or ESL contexts with varied sociocultural and educational backgrounds. Following Fallah (2014), we believe affective variables and personality factors vary not only among individuals, but also across cultures and
societies.
This study also intends to give impetus for further research into perfectionism and second language research. As a complex multidimensional personality factor, perfectionism
can contribute to second language learners' performance in different learning skills (Dickinson and Dickinson 2015). We investigated perfectionism with respect to self-efficacy
components. There are myriads of other constructs related to perfectionism that can propose a potentially valuable avenue for further research into SLA by consolidating theoretical and empirical insights into second language acquisition. Some related constructs
include procrastination, fear of failure, self-handicapping, foreign language anxiety, willingness to communicate, and achievement goal orientations, to name just a few.
