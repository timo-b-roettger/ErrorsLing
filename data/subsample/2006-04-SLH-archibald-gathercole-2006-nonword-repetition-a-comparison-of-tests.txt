Purpose: This study compared performance of children on 2 tests of nonword
repetition to investigate the factors that may contribute to the well-documented
nonword repetition deficit in specific language impairment (SLI).
Method: Twelve children with SLI age 7 to 11 years, 12 age-matched control children,
and 12 control children matched for language ability completed 2 tests of nonword
repetition: the Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (CNRep) and the Nonword
Repetition Test (NRT).
Results: The children with SLI performed significantly more poorly on both tests than
typically developing children of the same age. The SLI group was impaired on the
CNRep but not the NRT relative to younger children with similar language abilities
when adjustments were made for differences in general cognitive ability. The children
with SLI repeated the lengthiest nonwords and the nonwords containing consonant
clusters significantly less accurately than the control groups.
Conclusion: The evidence suggests that the nonword repetition deficit in SLI may arise
from a number of factors, including verbal short-term memory, lexical knowledge,
and output processes.

hildren with specific language impairment (SLI) experience particular difficulties in repeating multisyllabic nonwords such as
/wOG'l&mIk / or /nItaOf /. This finding has led to widespread interest in both the cognitive processes tapped by nonword repetition and
its diagnostic utility. The purpose of the present study was to compare
the performance of a group of children with SLI on two of the most widely
used tests of nonword repetition: the Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (CNRep; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1996) and the Nonword Repetition Test (NRT; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998).
Nonword repetition deficits in SLI have been established in several
research studies over the past 2 decades (e.g., Botting & Conti-Ramsden,
2001; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Edwards & Lahey, 1998; Ellis Weismer
et al., 2000; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Gray, 2003; Kamhi & Catts, 1986;
Kamhi, Catts, Maurer, Apel, & Gentry, 1988; Marton & Schwartz, 2003;
Montgomery, 2004; Norbury, Bishop, & Briscoe, 2002; Sahlen, ReuterskioldWagner, Nettelbladt, & Radeborg, 1999; Stothard, Snowling, Bishop,
Chipchase, & Kaplan, 1998). Difficulty repeating nonwords has been found
in children with SLI relative to younger, typically developing children with
matched language abilities (Edwards & Lahey, 1998; Gathercole & Baddeley,
1990; Montgomery, 1995), and in children with a history of SLI whose oral
language is no longer distinguishable from age peers ( Bishop, North, &
Donlan, 1996; Botting & Conti-Ramsden, 2001). Multisyllabic nonword
repetition has been found to be one task more impaired in children with

SLI than children with reading impairments, although
these groups perform similarly on many other tasks
(Kahmi & Catts, 1986; Kamhi et al., 1988).
Many studies have used one of two particular tests of
nonword repetition. The CNRep (Gathercole & Baddeley,
1996) is widely used in the United Kingdom, and the NRT
( Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998) has been used in many
U.S.-based studies of SLI. Consider first findings from studies using the CNRep. Deficits on the CNRep in children
with SLI have been found to have a strong genetic basis.
In two twin studies, Bishop and colleagues demonstrated
that the characteristic CNRep deficit in SLI is highly
heritable and distinguishable from the auditory temporal processing difficulties that are also characteristic of
the disorder (Bishop, Bishop, et al., 1999; Bishop, North,
& Donlan, 1996). Recently, nonword repetition deficits
in SLI assessed by a preliminary version of the CNRep
(Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1994) have been
linked in particular with abnormalities of chromosome 16q
(SLI Consortium, 2002, 2004). Based on the pattern of results from their twin study, Bishop et al. (1996) suggested
that the CNRep provides an effective phenotypic marker
of SLI. Conti-Ramsden and colleagues included CNRep in
an evaluation of potential clinical markers of SLI in a
group of 5-year-old children (Conti-Ramsden, 2003) and
a group of 11-year-old children with a previous history of
SLI (Conti-Ramsden, Botting, & Faragher, 2001). Results
indicated that nonword repetition provided a useful clinical marker, although the more difficult task of sentence
repetition was a more useful marker in the older age group.
The NRT has also been shown to be an excellent
discriminator of children with language impairment.
Dollaghan and Campbell (1998) reported that poor NRT
performance was 25 times more likely to occur in a clinically referred group of children receiving language intervention than children with typical language development.
Diagnostic accuracy of the NRT in this study surpassed
that of the Spoken Language Quotient of the Test of Language Development--Primary, Second Edition (Newcomer
& Hammill, 1988). Ellis Weismer et al. (2000) used the
NRT to examine nonword repetition in a population-based
sample of school-age children and reported that poor scores
were 6.5 times more likely to occur in children receiving
language intervention. An important feature of the NRT
is that it has been found to be less culturally biased than
typical standardized language tests in that scores have
not been found to distinguish typically developing White
American from African American children (Campbell,
Dollaghan, Needleman, & Janosky, 1997). Further, scores
on both the NRT and CNRep are reported to be largely
independent of performance IQ in children with both typical and atypical language development (Conti-Ramsden
et al., 2001; Ellis Weismer et al., 2000; Gathercole et al.,
1994).

Although there is substantial evidence that children
with SLI show similar patterns of deficit on both the
CNRep and NRT, no direct comparisons of performance
profiles on the two tasks have been made as yet for a common sample, and the purpose of the present study was to
do this. One aim of the study was to examine whether
children with SLI and children with typically developing
language skills differ equally strongly on both measures.
The second motivation for the study was to explore factors
that may account for any features of performance specific
to the individual tests. The two tests differ in their composition in several ways that are directly relevant to current theoretical accounts of the nonword repetition deficit
in SLI. The CNRep (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1996) contains
40 nonwords that range in length from two to five syllables.
Some of the stimuli contain consonant clusters (e.g.,
/'blnt'steIpI :/, /'pr IndlX/), the majority contain weak syllables with a reduced vowel (e.g., /'h&mpnt/, /'t&f lst/),
and many include lexical components and morphemes
(e.g., 'pen' in /'penlX/ or /ing/ in /'blnt'steIpIh/). Nonwords
are spoken with a natural prosodic pattern characteristic
of English words of that particular length. Each nonword
repetition attempt is scored online as either correct or
incorrect. In contrast, the NRT (Dollaghan & Campbell,
1998) consists of 16 nonwords ranging in length from one
to four syllables. All stimuli contain single consonants only
drawn from a set without late-acquired phonemes that are
acoustically salient and do not include any constituent syllables corresponding to lexical items. The nonwords are
spoken with equal stress on each syllable, facilitated by
the inclusion of tense vowels only (e.g., /teIvAk /). Repetition accuracy is scored from transcriptions as the percentage of phonemes correctly repeated in appropriate
positions (see also Gray, 2003; Sahlen et al., 1999).
Why should these differences matter? The reason is
that the two nonword sets differ in many of the factors
that have been suggested to play a role in the nonword
repetition deficit in SLI. An account of this deficit advanced
by Gathercole and Baddeley (1990) is that it reflects an
underlying impairment of verbal short-term memory. The
evidence in support of this claim is as follows. First, the
children with SLI in this study also performed poorly on
conventional measures of short-term memory such as digit
span and word recall (see also, Archibald & Gathercole, in
press; Montgomery, 1995), consistent with abundant evidence from other developmental and neuropsychological
studies that nonword repetition and digit span are highly
correlated with one another (see Baddeley, Gathercole, &
Papagno, 1998; Gathercole et al., 1994, for reviews). Second, this group showed the greatest repetition decrement
for the lengthiest nonwords, which were four syllables long.
Decreased recall accuracy for memory sequences that have
lengthy articulatory durations is a hallmark of verbal shortterm memory and is typically attributed to temporal decay

of the phonological representations in a short-term store
(Baddeley, Thomson, & Buchanan, 1975; Cowan, Saults,
Winterowd, & Sherk, 1991). By this account, the greater
repetition decrement for lengthier nonwords in children
with SLI could arise either from accelerated rates of decay before output or from inadequate encoding in the shortterm store. Third, it was argued that the unfamiliarity
of the phonological structure of nonwords forces participants to rely heavily on temporary phonological representations to support their repetition attempt, preventing the
reliance on activated lexical representations that arises in
memory tasks using familiar verbal stimuli (e.g., Hulme,
Maughan, & Brown, 1991).
Note that according to the original Gathercole and
Baddeley (1990) short-term memory account of nonword
repetition, children with SLI should be disadvantaged in
repeating any lengthy nonwords due to the lack of availability of compensatory lexical support. However, more
recent research has established that even memory for nonwords can benefit from some support from knowledge of
the lexical and phonotactic composition of the language
(Roodenrys & Hinton, 2002; Vitevitch & Luce, 2005). Mechanisms for such support may include lexical and sublexical
processing by which internal phonological representations of sound sequences are activated to encode the stimuli (Gupta & MacWhinney, 1997; Martin & Gupta, 2004),
or the process of redintegration, by which incomplete
memory representations are filled in at the time of retrieval (Gathercole, Frankish, Pickering, & Peaker, 1999;
Gathercole, Willis, & Baddeley, 1991). Such lexical and
redintegrative processes may be expected to compensate
to some degree for the short-term memory deficit in SLI.
If this is the case, the nonword repetition impairment of
the SLI group in the present study may be expected to be
greater on the NRT than the CNRep, due to the lesser
opportunity for knowledge-based support in the former
than the latter test stimuli.
Several alternative accounts of the nonword repetition deficit in SLI have since been advanced. Children
with less extensive vocabulary knowledge may be at a
disadvantage in nonword repetition because they have
fewer opportunities to supplement temporary representations in short-term memory due to their more impoverished repertoire of lexical and sublexical knowledge
(Snowling, Chiat, and Hulme, 1991) or less robustly
abstracted representations of individual phonemes
(Edwards, Beckman, & Munson, 2004). It may be,
also, that children with SLI have less efficient mechanisms either for using lexical knowledge to support shortterm memory or for creating representations within
long-term memory leading to difficulties in repeating
uncommon phoneme sequences even relative to children
with similar vocabulary skills. Perhaps, then, the source
of the nonword repetition deficit in children with SLI is
their more poorly differentiated representational system

972

arising from less efficient lexical mediation. On this
basis, children with SLI in the present study should be
more disadvantaged on the CNRep than the NRT, as the
stimuli used incorporate many more lexical and morphological elements that could potentially benefit children
with more extensive vocabulary knowledge or more efficient lexical mediation processes.
Nonword repetition accuracy is also undoubtedly influenced by the quality of speech output processes ( Wells,
1995), and this is an area in which children with SLI are
known to have problems. Individuals with SLI have more
difficulty producing well-organized and stable rhythmic
speech motor movements than typically developing children of the same age (Goffman, 1999, 2004); this may provide one possible cause of the nonword repetition deficit.
Sahlen et al. (1999) found that maturity of phonological
output processes was strongly associated with nonword
repetition scores in a sample of young children with language impairment. Also, children with SLI have been reported to be differentially impaired in repeating nonwords
containing consonant clusters, which place greater demands on speech output processes due to the need to coordinate a variety of articulatory gestures within a syllable
( Bishop et al., 1996). Although the present sample of children with SLI excluded individuals with marked articulatory or phonological impairments, it is possible that
the children had more subtle problems with speech motor
output that could jeopardize the accuracy of their nonword repetition attempts. In the present study, such difficulties may be reflected as greater SLI decrements in
the repetition of the clustered consonants and later developing phonemes of the CNRep nonwords than the single consonants and earlier developing phonemes in the
NRT stimuli.
One interpretational problem that commonly arises
in investigations of the theoretical underpinnings of nonword repetition and of SLI more generally concerns the
fact that language status at the time of testing may place
limitations on performance that make it difficult to determine whether poor performance is due to language impairment or some other underlying ability. To address this,
many studies include a control group matched with the
SLI participants on language abilities. Findings of deficits in children with SLI relative to a language control
group are extremely valuable in identifying areas of disproportionate deficit and so in providing clues as to the
etiology of the disorder. However, as children matched for
language ability are necessarily younger than children
with SLI ( by nearly 4 years on average in the present
study), their cognitive development is less mature, making null effects difficult to interpret (Edwards & Lahey,
1998; Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996; Plante, Swisher,
Kiernan, & Restrepo, 1993). For example, accuracy on
the CNRep in typically developing children improves by
about 20% between the ages of 6 and 9 years (Gathercole

et al., 1994). In the present study, general cognitive development is taken into account by adjusting repetition
scores using a measure of nonverbal ability as a means of
providing a fair comparison between different age groups.
Findings that the SLI group performed more poorly relative to both typically developing children matched for age
and for language level when scores were adjusted for nonverbal skills would indicate that the nonword repetition
deficit in SLI was disproportionate both to language and
nonverbal cognitive abilities.
In this study, two tests of nonword repetition, the
CNRep (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1996) and the NRT
(Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998), were completed by three
groups of children: school-age children with SLI and two
groups of typically developing children, one matched for
age and one matched for language abilities. The study
aimed to examine the pattern of group differences in performance across both measures to assess factors that may
contribute to the nonword repetition deficit in SLI. Performance was generally expected to be superior on the CNRep
than the NRT for all groups due to the inclusion of more
wordlike nonwords on the CNRep that provide opportunities for support by existing lexical knowledge. Poorer
repetition on both tests was predicted for the SLI group,
at least relative to the control group matched for age.
In addition, it was hypothesized that the pattern of
SLI decrements across the tests may reflect the relative
contribution to the poor nonword repetition in SLI of three
factors: short-term memory, lexical mediation, and speech
output. Specific predictions for the present study corresponding to each of these cognitive processes are as follows:
(a) Disproportionate impairments on the NRT would be
consistent with a verbal short-term memory account of the
nonword repetition impairment in SLI, as would greater
SLI deficits on the lengthier nonwords of both tests.
(b) Greater SLI deficits on the CNRep, particularly on the
highly wordlike stimuli, would point to poor lexical mediation processes as an important factor. (c) Poorer performance by the SLI group on the CNRep than the NRT
may also point to deficits in motor speech output as a factor, as may findings of greater SLI deficits on the nonwords
of the CNRep with a high proportion of consonant clusters.

Method
Participants
Thirty-six children participated in three groups in the
present study: 12 children with SLI, 12 chronological-agematched control children (age matched), and 12 languageage-matched control children (language matched). Each
group comprised 8 boys and 4 girls. The mean age of the
groups was as follows: SLI, 9;8 (years;months; SD = 1.70,
range = 7;3-12;5), age matched, 9;9 (SD = 1.64, range =
7;0-12;5), and language matched, 6;1 (SD = 1.61, range =

4;4-10;4). All participants achieved a standard score of
85 or greater on a test of nonverbal reasoning (Raven's
Coloured Progressive Matrices; Raven, Court, & Raven,
1986), and a test of articulation (Goldman Fristoe Test
of Articulation--Second Edition (GFTA-2; Goldman &
Fristoe, 2000). All of the children were native English
speakers. None of the children had a diagnosis of attentiondeficit disorder or attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, or hearing impairment.
Descriptive statistics for the criterion measures completed
by the children are summarized in Table 1.
SLI group. The children in the SLI group were recruited from language units (n = 10) and special schools
(n = 2) over a 3-month period. The children met the identification criteria for SLI described by Records and Tomblin
(1994). They performed at least 1.25 standard deviations
below the mean on two of four language measures including one receptive measure. The receptive measures were
the British Picture Vocabulary Scale, Second Edition
( BPVS-II; Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley, 1997) and
the Test for Reception of Grammar (TROG; Bishop, 1982).
The expressive measures were the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT; Williams, 1997) and the Recalling Sentences subtest of the Clinical Evaluation of Language
Fundamentals--UK3 (CELF-UK3; Semel, Wiig, & Secord,
1995). Group means for the BPVS-II, TROG, and EVT
were approximately 1.25 standard deviations below the
standardized mean and that for the Recalling Sentences
subtest was more than 2 standard deviations below the
mean. For each test, the proportion of children who scored
below the 1.25-standard-deviations cutoff was as follows:
BPVS-II, .75; TROG, .67; EVT, .58; Recalling Sentences,
1.0. Individual language profiles conformed closely to
the group pattern, with 9 participants scoring more than
1.25 standard deviations below the mean on three or four
of the language measures.
Control groups. The children participating in the control groups were recruited over a 1-month period from a
school with a similar socioeconomic intake to the schools
attended by the SLI group 2 months after recruitment of
the SLI group. None of the children had any history of
speech or language problems or any type of exceptional
educational needs, according to school records. All of the
children scored within 1 standard deviation of the mean
for their age on three of the language measures described
above (BPVS-II, TROG, EVT) and either the Recalling
Sentences subtest or an expressive grammatical subtest
(see below). The age-matched group was matched to the
SLI group on sex and age, and the language-matched
group on sex and BPVS-II raw score (mean difference in
raw score= 2.5, SD = 2.07).
In one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), group
differences were found for raw scores on all measures at
p < .001, with the exception of the Raven score ( p = .018).
The age-matched group had significantly higher raw scores

on all measures at p < .01 except the Raven's ( p = .043),
whereas the SLI and language-matched groups did not
differ significantly on raw score on any of the screening
measures except the Raven's ( p = .025). On the basis of
this group difference, Raven raw score was used as a covariate in all parametric analyses of group differences.
The language measures used in the present study
were selected on the basis of their widespread use for the
identification of children with SLI (e.g., Bishop, Bright,
et al., 2000; Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996; Botting &
Conti-Ramsden, 2001). It is clear, though, that sentence
imitation tasks such as the Recalling Sentences subtest
used here not only test language ability but also are linked
to short-term memory (Blake, Austin, Cannon, Lisus, &
Vaughan, 1994; Willis & Gathercole, 2001). To ensure that
participant selection decisions were based on language
rather than memory skills, additional expressive language
tests were administered in two situations: when children
with SLI scored below the cutoff score on only two
language tests and one of them was Recalling Sentences
(n = 5) and when control children scored below age level
on Recalling Sentences (age matched: n = 2; language
matched: n = 2). The children in the SLI group completed
the two additional expressive subtests of the CELF-UK3
required to compute the test's Expressive Language score
for their age (Sentence Assembly and Formulating Sentences). In all cases, the Expressive Language score was
greater than 1.25 standard deviations below average, establishing the presence of an expressive language deficit.

974

Those in the control groups completed one test of expressive grammatical skills, the Word Structure subtest of the
CELF-UK3, and scored either above 7 for their age or at
ceiling, establishing intact expressive grammatical skills.

Procedure
The measures reported in the present study were
completed in four individual half-hour sessions in a quiet
room in the child's school. In addition to the language
screening measures listed above, each child completed
the CNRep (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1996) and the NRT
(Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998). The language screening
measures were completed in two sessions at the time of
recruitment. Once recruitment was complete, the nonword repetition tasks were administered in a single session. The nonword repetition tasks were completed in a
session in which the participants also completed four visuospatial memory tasks not reported here. The order of
tasks for this session was as follows: Completion of two
visuospatial tasks, the CNRep, two visuospatial tasks,
and the NRT. Responses for all measures were recorded
on a digital minidisk player.
Nonword repetition tasks. For each of the nonword
repetition tasks, children were told that they would
hear some made-up words and be asked to repeat each
one exactly as they had heard it. Each word was played
once followed by a 3-s pause during which the child
responded.

The CNRep (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1996) involves
the presentation of 40 nonwords, divided equally into
two-, three-, four- and five-syllable items, that the child
is required to repeat. Half of the nonwords contain consonant clusters (e.g., /'blnt'steIpI:/), and the remainder
have single consonants only (e.g., /wOG'l&mIk/). The nonwords are presented in a fixed random order by audiotape
recording. Typical English stress patterns are used in the
presentation.
The NRT (Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998) consists of
16 nonwords; 4 stimuli contain one, two, three, and four
syllables, respectively. The nonwords are constructed
from a limited set of phonemes (11 consonants, 9 vowels)
excluding late developing sounds. The nonwords follow
an alternating CV structure, and none of the syllables
correspond to English lexical items. Only tense vowels
are used, and therefore the stress patterns of the nonwords are unlike typical English words in that they have
no weak syllables. A detailed description of the criteria guiding the development of the NRT is provided by
Dollaghan and Campbell (1998). A fixed random order
of nonwords was adopted for this study to ensure consistency across both tests. The nonwords were presented
by digital audio recording of a native British adult female speaker following the phonetic transcription and
pronunciation guidelines described by Dollaghan and
Campbell (1998).
Scoring and reliability. All responses to the nonword repetition tests were scored at the phoneme level
to provide comparable data across both tests. Each
phoneme was scored as correct or incorrect in relation to
the target phoneme. Phoneme substitutions and omissions were scored as incorrect; correctly articulated phonemes with slight distortions were scored as correct. As
several research groups in the field do not score phoneme
additions as errors (e.g., Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998;
Ellis Weismer et al., 2000), phoneme additions were not
counted as errors in the present study. In cases of syllable
omissions, an anchoring procedure based on vowel alignment was used to align the syllable sequences as closely
as possible to the target syllable before individual phoneme scoring. For each nonword repetition task and each
nonword length, the number of phonemes correct was divided by the total number of phonemes in the set, resulting in a percentage phonemes correct at each nonword
length. These values were used to compute a mean percentage phonemes correct for the entire set for each task.
This method of calculating a total score avoids disproportionate contribution by the longest nonwords to the total
score (Kane et al., 2004).
Scoring was completed by the first author, a trained
speech-language pathologist. A second listener trained
in phonetic transcription with no knowledge of the participants' language status and group transcribed 14% of

the samples independently (five audiotaped responses for
each test). Phoneme percentages of interrater agreement
ranged from 79% to 90%, with an average of 86% for the
NRT, and from 84% to 96%, with an average of 90% for
the CNRep. In addition, four audiotaped responses from
participants completing the NRT for each participant
group (33%) were transcribed a second time independently by the first author, 4 months after the initial transcriptions. Phoneme percentages of intrarater agreement
ranged from 90% to 100%, with an average of 98%.

Results
Descriptive statistics in percentage phonemes correct are presented for both nonword repetition tests and
all participant groups in Table 2. As the two tasks differed in numbers of stimuli, scores were expressed as
percentage values for the purposes of comparison across
tests and syllable lengths. For all participant groups,
mean scores were higher for the CNRep than the NRT at
equivalent syllable lengths. Accuracy decreased with
increase in nonword length for all groups, except for the
longest length of the CNRep (see also Gathercole et al.,
1994). The decline in repetition accuracy with increasing length was most marked on the NRT. Means across
participant groups were similar for shorter nonword
lengths, but the age-matched group scored more highly
at the longer lengths. The SLI group means were lower
than both control groups on the CNRep but lower than
the age-matched group only on the NRT.
A rationalized arcsine transform function was used
to convert all scores into interval-level data for statistical analysis (Studebaker, 1985). Group differences were
evaluated in a series of analyses of covariance (ANCOVA)
with Raven's raw score entered as covariate. Before each
ANCOVA, a test for homogeneity of regression slopes was
completed (Wildt & Ahtola, 1978). In all cases, the interaction between group and Raven score was not significant
( p > .05), indicating that there were no group differences
in the Raven slope function.

Group Comparisons: Nonword Repetition
Mean phoneme accuracy scores on both nonword repetition measures adjusted for Raven score for all participant
groups are summarized in Figure 1. Separate univariate
ANCOVAs were used to assess group differences in the
total score of each test for each of the three groups with
Raven score as covariate. For the CNRep, the main effect of group was significant, F(2, 32) = 4.212, p = .024,
hp2 = .21, and Raven score was a significant covariate,
F(1, 32) = 7.637, p = .009, hp2 = .19. Planned contrasts
revealed that the SLI group performed more poorly than

both of the control groups (age match: p = .024, language
match: p = .035). For the NRT, Raven score was a significant covariate, F(1, 32) = 24.949, p < .001, hp2 = .44,
but the main effect of group failed to reach significance,
F(2, 32) = 2.525, p = .096, hp2 = .14. Cognitive development had a significant effect on performance on both
tests; however, the effect size of the Raven covariate was
considerably larger for the NRT (0.44) than for the CNRep
(0.19). Thus, when scores were adjusted for individual differences in cognitive ability, the SLI group performed more
poorly than both of the control groups on the CNRep but
at equivalent levels to the control groups on the NRT.
In the next set of analyses, the performance of the
three groups across syllable lengths was compared for
each nonword repetition test separately in mixed-model
ANCOVAs as a function of group and syllable length, with
Raven score as covariate. For the CNRep scores, there
were significant main effects of length, F(3, 96) = 12.806,
p < .001, hp2 = .29, and group, F(2, 32) = 3.456, p = .044,
hp2 = .18. Raven score was a significant covariate,
F(1, 32) = 5.94, p = .021, hp2 = .16, and interacted significantly with length, F(3, 96) = 6.684, p < .001, hp2 = .17.
The interaction between length and group was not significant, F(6, 96) = 1.246, p = .290, hp2 = .07. The main
effect of length reflects a significant decrease in repetition accuracy with increasing length, and the interaction
of length with Raven score reflects a significant developmental trend in nonword repetition. Planned contrasts
between groups revealed that the SLI group performed
more poorly than the age-matched group ( p = .044). In
comparison with the analysis on the CNRep total score,
the contrast with the language-matched group in this analysis marginally failed to reach significance ( p = .057), which
likely reflects the reduced power associated with this
Group x Length analysis.
In the corresponding analysis on the NRT phoneme
accuracy scores across syllable lengths, the main effect
of length was significant, F(3, 63) = 8.337, p < .001, hp2 =
.21, due to the decrease in repetition accuracy with increasing stimulus length. Raven score was a significant
covariate, F(1, 32) = 22.429, p < .001, hp2 = .41, and
interacted significantly with length, F(3, 96) = 6.145,
p = .006, hp2 = .16. The interaction between length and
group was not significant, F(6, 96) = 1.095, p = .371,
hp2 = .06. The main effect of group did not reach significance, F(2, 32) = 2.103, p = .139, hp2 = .17, although
the effect size was similar to that found for the main effect of group in the corresponding CNRep analysis (.18).
The failure to find a group effect in the NRT total
score or syllable length analyses appears to contradict previous findings (e.g., Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Ellis
Weismer et al., 2000); however, the statistical comparisons involved in these studies differed from the current
work in important ways: They compared larger groups,

of similar ages, and without covarying nonverbal abilities. To provide directly comparable results, the NRT scores
of the SLI and age-matched groups in the present study
were compared in an analysis of variance as a function of
group and syllable length. All terms were significant:
group, F(1, 22) = 16.080, p = .001, hp2 = .42; length,
F(1, 22) = 19.728, p < .001, hp2 = .47; length and group,
F(1, 22) = 3.154, p = .031, hp2 = .13. Note that when the
analysis was repeated with Raven score as covariate,
the main effects (both group and length) remained significant. In agreement with previous studies, these results indicate that the SLI group did perform more poorly
than the age-matched group with similar nonverbal abilities. Level of cognitive development as indexed by Raven
score, however, did have a greater effect on NRT than
CNRep performance. It is possible that there was insufficient power to detect a group difference when all three
groups (age range = 4-12 years) were included in the analysis due to the small sample size.
To summarize the findings for the group comparisons
of total scores and syllable lengths, the SLI group performed more poorly than the age-matched group on
the CNRep and NRT but was impaired relative to the
language-matched group only on the CNRep once scores
were adjusted for nonverbal abilities.

Group Comparisons: Specific Features
Nonword length. Although the performance decrement of the SLI group was greater for the longest nonwords in the present study, the preceding analyses did
not establish a significant increase in the SLI deficit with
lengthier nonwords as has been found in previous studies
(e.g., Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Gathercole & Baddeley,
1990). One possibility is that the analyses reported above
lacked sufficient power to detect an interaction given the
presence of four levels in the length variable together with
a small sample size. To increase the power for detecting
such an interaction, we compared group performance on
the shortest (one or two syllables) and longest (four or five
syllables) item lengths in a single ANCOVA as a function
of group, length, and test, with Raven score as covariate.
In the case of the longest items of the CNRep (4 and 5
syllable lengths) and shortest items of the NRT (1 and 2
syllable lengths), where two syllable lengths in the test
comprised either long or short nonwords respectively,
an accuracy score was computed by averaging across the
two respective lengths. As in the previous analyses, there
was a main effect of length, F(1, 32) = 38.363, p < .001,
hp2 = .55, and group, F(2, 32) = 3.563, p = .040, hp2 = .18.
There was also a main effect of test, F(1, 32) = 29.315,
p < .001, hp2 = .48, in favor of the CNRep. Raven score was
a significant covariate, F(1, 32) = 10.053, p = .003, hp2 = .24,
and interacted significantly with length, F(1, 32) = 12.458,
p = .001, hp2 = .28, and test, F(1, 32) = 10.194, p = .003,

hp2 = .24, but the three-way interaction between Raven
score, test, and length was not significant, F(1, 32) =
0.050, p = .852, hp2 = .002. Neither the interaction
between test and length, F(1, 32) = 0.033, p = .858, hp2 =
.001; test and group, F(2, 32) = 0.340, p = .714, hp2 = .021;
nor test, length, and group, F(2, 32) = 2.619, p = .088, hp2 =
.14, was significant. Importantly, there was a significant
interaction between length and group, F(2, 32) = 4.794,
p = .015, hp2 = .23. Analysis of simple effects revealed
that group differences occurred on the long nonwords,
F(2, 32) = 7.398, p = .002, hp2 = .32, but not the short
nonwords, F(2, 32) = 0.491, p = .617, hp2 = .03. In the
case of the long nonwords, the SLI group performed
more poorly than both the age-matched ( p = .002) and
language-matched ( p = .013) control groups. Figure 2
displays adjusted means for this interaction and establishes that the decline in performance on the long versus
short items was more marked for the SLI as compared with the other two groups.
Wordlikeness. The possible contribution of poor lexical knowledge to the nonword repetition deficit in SLI
was examined in a post hoc analysis of the CNRep. One
way of investigating the degree of lexical mediation in
nonword repetition is by comparing repetition accuracy on

stimuli rated as low and high in wordlikeness (Gathercole,
1995; Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1991). The
wordlikeness ratings obtained by Gathercole, Willis,
Emslie, and Baddeley (1991) on a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 (very unlike a real word) to 5 (very like a real word)
were used to create two subsets of 14 CNRep items
matched for number of phonemes, syllables, and consonant
clusters (see Appendix A). One set contained nonwords
of low-rated wordlikeness, whereas the other contained
high-wordlikeness items. Mean percentage phoneme accuracy and standard deviations for each participant group
on the high- and low-wordlikeness sets are summarized in
Table 3. The pattern of slightly higher repetition accuracy
for the high- than the low-wordlikeness set was consistent
for all groups, although the difference was minimal for the
age control group. In the ANCOVA performed on the scores
for the wordlikeness sets between groups with Raven score
as covariate, the main effect of wordlikeness failed to reach
significance, F(1, 32) = 3.653, p = .065, hp2 = .10. There was
a significant main effect of group, F(2, 32) = 4.441, p = .020,
hp2 = .22, but not a significant Wordlikeness x Group
interaction, F(2, 32) = 0.163, p = .850, hp2 = .01. Raven
score was a significant covariate, F(1, 32) = 8.314,
p = .007, hp2 = .21, but did not interact significantly with

wordlikeness, F(1, 32) = 0.980, p = .330, hp2 = .03. The
SLI group had lower scores than both the age- ( p = .20)
and language-matched groups ( p = .033) in planned
contrasts. In the present data, then, there was no difference in sensitivity to wordlikeness across the SLI
and control groups.
Articulatory complexity. A second post hoc analysis
of the CNRep data explored the possible effects of speech
motor output processes on nonword repetition, as indexed
by the presence of consonant clusters. As clusters are more
complex to produce than single consonants, a finding of
increased SLI deficits with stimuli containing these structures may point to motoric differences as a source of the
nonword repetition deficits. In the present study, two subsets of 15 CNRep items were created matched for syllable
length (see Appendix B). Items in the single-consonant
group had an alternating CV structure only, with no adjacent consonants even across syllable boundaries, whereas items in the consonant clusters group had clusters in at
least half of their syllables. The subsets included 5 items
at the two-syllable length, 5 at the three-syllable length,
and 5 at the four-syllable length. The five-syllable length
was not included because there were insufficient tokens of
five-syllable items without consonant clusters for comparison. Mean percentage phoneme accuracy and standard
deviations are shown in Table 3 for each group on the lists
containing words with either single consonants or consonant clusters. Mean scores were lower on the consonant
clusters than single-consonant list for all groups, but the
reduction in performance across lists was greatest for the
SLI group. Results of the ANCOVA comparing articulatory
complexity, and participant groups on phoneme accuracy
with Raven score as covariate revealed one significant effect, a significant interaction between articulatory complexity and group, F(2, 32) = 4.321, p = .022, h2p = .21.
Raven score was a significant covariate, F(1, 32) = 6.960,
p = .533, h2p = .13, but did not interact significantly with
articulatory complexity, F(1, 32) = 0.398, p = .533, h2p =
.01. Neither the main effects of articulatory complexity,
F(1, 32) = 0.224, p = .640, h2p = .01, or group, F(2, 32) =
2.823, p = .074, h2p = .15, reached significance. Analysis
of simple effects indicated that the groups differed on
the consonant cluster, F(2, 32) = 6.268, p = .005, h2p =
.28, but not the single-consonant nonword list, F(2, 32) =
0.529, p = .594, h2p = .03. Planned contrasts confirmed
that the SLI group performed at a lower level on the consonant cluster word list than either the age-matched
( p = .003) or the language-matched ( p = .014) groups.

Discussion
Nonword repetition deficits were found in the present study in a group of children with SLI when compared across two measures of nonword repetition: the

CNRep (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1996) and the NRT
(Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998). The performance of the
SLI group was impaired relative also to younger, typically developing children with similar language abilities
once scores were adjusted for differences in general cognitive ability on the CNRep only. The magnitude of the
impairment of the SLI group increased for lengthier and
for more articulatory complex nonwords, relative to both
typically developing groups. Of the two tests, the NRT
was influenced to a greater degree by differences in developmental cognitive ability.
In line with previous findings, the results indicate
that children with SLI have a disproportionate difficulty
in repeating novel phonological sequences. Why is this?
One proposal has been that an impairment of short-term
memory may underlie the nonword repetition deficit in
SLI (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990). In keeping with this
suggestion, the nonword repetition deficit of the SLI group
relative to the control groups was greatest for the longest
nonwords (see also Botting & Conti-Ramsden, 2001;
Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Edwards & Lahey, 1998;
Ellis Weismer et al., 2000; Kamhi & Catts, 1986; Kamhi
et al., 1988; Marton & Schwartz, 2003; Montgomery,
1995, 2004). According to Baddeley et al. (1998), shortterm memory plays a key role in learning new words by
generating a phonological representation of brief and novel
speech events that mediates the creation of a phonological
entry within the long-term lexical store. Children with SLI
therefore may have more difficulty learning new words
because their short-term memory representations are
inadequate.
The present findings cannot, however, be readily accommodated solely by a verbal short-term memory deficit
in SLI. One crucial difference between the two repetition
tests is that nonwords in the NRT do not incorporate any
lexical or sublexical units, whereas items in the CNRep include sublexical and morphological components. On this
basis, it would be expected that the NRT would have a
greater dependence on short-term memory, due to the
reduced opportunities for support via lexical and phonotactic redintegration processes. In line with this view,
repetition accuracy was greater on the CNRep than the
NRT even though the order of test administration (NRT
second) may have been expected to benefit the NRT (Gray,
2003). If a short-term memory deficit alone underpins the
nonword repetition deficit in SLI, children with SLI should
be more disadvantaged on the NRT than the CNRep as a
consequence of lack of opportunity for successful redintegration. Contrary to this prediction, the SLI group deficit
was found to be greater on the CNRep. The children with
SLI obtained lower scores on the CNRep than both groups
of control children, whereas the typically developing groups
did not differ from one another. In contrast, performance of
the SLI and language groups was equivalent on the NRT
even when adjusted for nonverbal ability.

One explanation for this finding is that children with
SLI have less efficient lexical mediation processes to support short-term memory in the course of nonword repetition. The finding of a greater SLI deficit on the CNRep
is consistent with this view. In addition, though, it would
be expected that the SLI group should show a reduced
advantage to nonwords high in wordlikeness, whereas
in fact no group deficits in sensitivity to wordlikeness
were observed. It should, however, be acknowledged that
performance approached ceiling levels for the agematched control children in part of this analysis, which
could potentially have masked a greater benefit of high
wordlikeness in this group. Further systematic investigation is required to resolve this issue.
One factor that does appear to have contributed a differential effect on the SLI group is the articulatory complexity of the nonword stimuli. It may be that the greater
SLI deficit on the CNRep arises in part from the inclusion
of consonant clusters in contrast to the NRT. In keeping
with this notion, only the SLI group showed a marked decline in repetition accuracy on the nonwords containing
consonant clusters, in line with Bishop et al.'s (1996) findings. Thus, although in both studies, the children with language impairments had no gross motor speech deficits,
they were further disadvantaged in nonword repetition
when the articulatory demands of the stimuli were particularly complex. There are at least two possible interpretations of this finding: The children with SLI may
have less robust phonological representations for these
relatively uncommon phoneme combinations, although
recent evidence from children with phonological impairments has not supported this suggestion (Munson,
Edwards, & Beckman, 2005). Alternatively, the children
with SLI may have difficulty forming the novel phonological sequences required in nonword repetition. In line
with this view, Goffman (2004) reported that children with
SLI have difficulty producing well-organized and stable
rhythmic speech motor movements, which may affect their
ability to repeat nonwords. It is possible, then, that the
(poor) speech motor output skills of children with SLI
contribute in part at least to their difficulties in nonword
repetition.
The two nonword repetition tasks also differed in
the strength of their associations with the nonverbal reasoning measure that is widely interpreted as tapping
general cognitive maturity, Raven's Matrices. Scores on
the NRT were much more highly associated with performance on the Raven test than CNRep scores, suggesting
that the former nonword repetition task may be more
closely linked to general cognitive development than the
CNRep. One limitation of the present study was the small
sample size together with the large age range of participants across groups (4-12 years), which may account for
the failure to detect a group difference when all three
groups were compared on the test more sensitive to

980

cognitive abilities, the NRT. One further possibility is
that the SLI group may have benefited from a differential
practice effect, resulting in greater improvements on the
second repetition test administered (NRT) relative to the
control groups (Gray, 2003). SLI deficits on the CNRep,
on the other hand, were demonstrable even for the small
sample sizes involved in the present study, as they were
for the NRT when the children with SLI were compared
with their age peers.
In summary, this study confirms previous findings
of poor nonword repetition in children with SLI for two
tests of nonword repetition: the CNRep (e.g., Bishop et al.,
1996; Botting & Conti-Ramsden, 2001; Gathercole &
Baddeley, 1990) and the NRT (e.g., Dollaghan & Campbell,
1998; Ellis Weismer et al., 2000). In line with a verbal
short-term memory account of the deficit, the SLI group
had more difficulty holding novel phonological forms in
mind as reflected by the increased magnitude of their
repetition impairment for longer nonwords. The test
with the greater ability to identify SLI deficits was the
CNRep, in which items incorporate sublexical units, grammatical morphemes, and consonant clusters. The children
with SLI had more difficulty repeating words with increased articulatory complexity but benefited from lexical similarity of nonwords to the same extent as typically
developing children. These results suggest that verbal
short-term memory alone may not provide a full explanation of the nonword deficit in SLI. It is possible that
there are multiple origins to the deficit in nonword repetition: verbal short-term memory, lexical knowledge, output processes, and others. The CNRep, therefore, may
better reflect the nonword repetition deficit in SLI because it incorporates stimuli that tap several of these
components.
