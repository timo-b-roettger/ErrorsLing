ABSTRACT
This paper explores whether English-Mandarin bilingual children have mastered discourse skills and
whether they show sensitivity to the discourse principle of information status of referents in their
speech and gestures. We compare the speech and gestures produced by bilingual children to those
produced by English- and Mandarin-speaking monolingual children. Six English-speaking and six
Mandarin-speaking monolingual children, and nine English-Mandarin bilingual children (who were
more dominant in English) were videotaped while interacting with their caregivers. Monolingual
Mandarin- and English-speaking children produced null arguments and pronouns respectively to
indicate given third-person referents, and nouns to indicate new third-person referents. They also
gestured new third-person referents more often than given third-person referents. Thus, monolinguals'
speech and gestures followed the discourse principle. English-Mandarin bilingual children's speech
and gestures also followed the discourse principle but only when they were speaking in English. They
produced nouns more often to indicate given third-person referents than to indicate new third-person
referents in Mandarin, indicating the violation of the discourse principle. It is interesting that they
gestured new third-person referents more often than given third-person referents in Mandarin. Thus,
our findings suggest that gesture precedes language development at discourse level in the less-dominant
language in bilinguals.

The literature has shown that children learning null argument languages, that is,
languages that allow argument omissions, are particularly sensitive to discoursepragmatic features. For example, Italian- and Inuktitut-speaking children use overt
arguments to indicate new referents but null arguments to indicate given referents
(e.g., Allen, 2000; Allen & Schroder, 2003; Serratrice, 2005). Likewise, children
learning other null argument languages such as Chinese (So, Demir, & GoldinMeadow, 2010), Korean (Clancy, 1993), Hindi (Narasimhan, Budwig & Murty,

2005), and Romance (Paradis & Navarro, 2003) follow discourse principles in
their speech. Recent research findings showed that children who are learning a
subject-prominent language, like English, appear to be as sensitive to the discourse
principles as children learning null argument languages (So et al., 2010). However, previous studies on the acquisition of discourse-pragmatic skills focused on
monolingual children only. The question of interest is whether bilingual children
who are learning a null argument language, Mandarin Chinese, and a nonnull
argument language, English, have mastered discourse skills in both languages.
Bilinguals usually do not acquire both languages at the same pace (e.g.,
Bialystok, 1988; Cromdal, 1999; Hakuta & Diaz, 1985; Mayberry & Nicoladis,
2000; Nicoladis, Mayberry, & Genesee, 1999). This is mainly because most bilingual children are rarely exposed to the "one-parent-one-language" environment.
Rather their parents use different languages with them, with the time spent on each
language being uneven. Hence, this results in bilingual children being more dominant in one language than the other (Pearson, Fernandez, Lewedeg, & Oller, 1997).
Little is known of the acquisition of discourse skills in bilinguals. Related to
this line of research, Gullberg (2006) found that second language (L2) learners
are often more explicit when speaking their L2 (weaker language) than they need
to be. For example, they used specific referential expressions (i.e., nouns) in L2
for both newly introduced and previously mentioned characters, suggesting that
they were not sensitive to the discourse principle of information status in L2.
However, they produced nouns more often for newly introduced characters than
for previously mentioned characters in their first language (L1, stronger language),
suggesting that they have mastered the discourse skills in L1.
In the present study, we ask whether bilingual children have acquired discourse
skills in two languages that vary in language proficiency. We focus on two languages, English and Mandarin Chinese. English is a subject-prominent language
in which the subject-predicate relationship plays a major role in the grammar.
In addition, it has verb morphology and inflection to mark subject agreement
of the verb. Thus, it requires each sentence to include a subject (Bloom, 1990;
Hyams & Wexler, 1993). For example, it is ungrammatical to say "eat" without
mentioning the subject "she."1 Besides subjects, English also requires objects to
be mentioned. It is ungrammatical to say, "I take" without mentioning the object
"the umbrella." In general, English requires arguments to be overtly mentioned in
speech. However, English speakers should use pronouns instead of nouns when
referring back to the arguments that have been mentioned in the previous discourse
context (Chomksy, 1981).
Mandarin Chinese, unlike English, is a topic-prominent language. Thus, it
allows deletion of arguments (Huang, 1984; Tsao, 1990). For example, it is grammatical to say "Chi1 fan4" (eat lunch) without mentioning the subject "ta1" (she).
It is also grammatical to say "wo3 na2 le4" (I take) without mentioning the
object "zan3 zi3" (umbrella). However, Mandarin speakers do not omit arguments
randomly. Rather they omit arguments when discourse conditions are appropriate
(Lee & Naigles, 2005; Tsao, 1990). In a discourse in Mandarin, overt nouns refer
to the entities that are not previously mentioned and not retrievable from previous context, whereas omitted arguments refer to the entities that are previously
mentioned and are analyzed as coreferential with the overt noun phases in the

73

preceding text (Chiu, 2001; Chu, 1998; Li, 2004; Li & Thompson, 1979; Tao,
1996). Hence, listeners can still understand what omitted arguments are referring
to based on the information previously mentioned in the discourse.
Thus, English and Mandarin Chinese are grammatically different from each
other in terms of representation of arguments in speech. Previous findings showed
that English- and Mandarin-speaking children have acquired the grammatical
rules in argument representation in their native languages. Zheng and GoldinMeadow (2002) observed English- and Mandarin-speaking children in a natural
discourse context and found that English-speaking children obeyed the patterns of
English and rarely omitted words for the agents. In contrast, Mandarin-speaking
children displayed greater flexibility in their argument representation as Mandarin permits deletion. However, these children showed a bias to delete only the
subjects of caused motion, not the subjects of spontaneous motion. Likewise,
Wang, Lillo-Martin, Best, and Levitt (1992) found that Mandarin-speaking children dropped their subjects and objects at a much higher rate than English-speaking
children. They also showed that Mandarin-speaking children display an asymmetry in their deletion patterns, that is, they omitted subjects more frequently than
objects.
Previous research has also shown that young English and Mandarin monolingual
children have mastered discourse-pragmatic principle that underlies their respective languages (So et al., 2010). In their study, English- and Mandarin-speaking
caregivers were engaged in spontaneous interactions with their children. Their
findings showed that Mandarin-speaking children omitted arguments more often
than English-speaking children but that both English- and Mandarin-speaking
children followed the discourse-pragmatic principle of information status of referents in their speech. That is, they produced nouns to indicate new referents and
pronouns or null arguments to indicate given referents.
The first aim of the present study is to examine whether English-Mandarin
bilinguals show sensitivity to the discourse-pragmatic principle of information
status of referents in both languages. In order to address this issue, we compare the
ways English-Mandarin bilinguals use speech to refer to given and new referents to
age-matched English- and Mandarin-speaking monolingual children's. We expect
that unbalanced bilingual children might have acquired discourse-pragmatic skills
in their stronger language but not in their less dominant one.
Children also gesture when they talk. For example, they point to a bottle to
refer to the bottle. It is interesting that their gestures followed the same pattern
as speech: they gestured more often when indicating new referents than when
indicating given referents (So et al., 2010). Overall, children used nouns and
gestures to indicate referents that needed to be specified. Thus, sensitivity to the
discourse-pragmatic principle in speech appears to go hand-in-hand with that in
gestures. The second aim of the present study is to explore whether gestures
produced by English-Mandarin bilinguals follow the discourse principle when
they are speaking in both languages.
Previous research showed that young children often convey their thoughts not
only in their spoken modality but also in their gestures (e.g., Alibali, 1999; Church
& Goldin-Meadow, 1986; Perry, Church, & Goldin-Meadow, 1988). It is more
important that they use gestures to express thoughts that are not ready to be

Applied Psycholinguistics 35:1

74

convyed in speech (Garber, Alibali, & Goldin-Meadow, 1998; Goldin-Meadow,
Alibali, & Church, 1993). In the study by Garber et al. (1998), fourth-grade
children were asked to explain mathematics problems to an experimenter, and
it was found that the students conveyed solutions in gestures but not in speech.
Church and Goldin-Meadow (1986) reported that children often expressed new
solutions to mathematics problems in gestures before they could articulate those
solutions in speech.
Thus, emerging thought or knowledge is usually conveyed in gestures followed
by speech. Such a phenomenon could be generalized to language acquisition.
Previous findings showed that 10- to 14-month-old infants produced pointing
gestures to refer to objects before they produced lexical words (Iverson & GoldinMeadow, 2005), 12-month-old infants produced action gestures prior to words
(Capirci, Contaldo, Caselli, & Volterra, 2005), and 18-month-old infants combined
a gesture and a word before they combined two words (Ozcaliskan & GoldinMeadow, 2005). Gesture always seems to precede advances in speech.
Based on those previous findings, the possibility is raised that bilingual children
who have not yet mastered discourse skills in their less dominant language might
still be able to distinguish new referents from given referents in their gestures.
That is, they might gesture new referents more often than given referents.
In the present study, we videotaped spontaneous interactions between children
(both monolingual and bilingual) and their caregivers. We specifically looked at
how bilingual children used speech and gestures to convey given and new referents
and compared their speech and gestures with those produced by Mandarin- and
English-speaking monolingual children.
METHOD

Participants

Our monolingual participants were six English-speaking children (three males,
three females), and six Mandarin-speaking children (four males, two females).
The mean age of the monolingual English-speaking children was 5 years, 1 month
(5;1, range = 4;4-5;5), and that of the monolingual Chinese-speaking children
was 4;9 (range = 4;3-5;8). English- and Chinese-speaking children were living in
Chicago and Nanjing, China, respectively, in middle-class homes. Their caregivers
were recruited from postings and were paid for their participation. Half of our
monolingual children (three in each language group) participated in So et al.'s
2010 study. The rest of the monolingual children were added for this study.
Our bilingual participants were nine Singaporean Chinese children (five males,
four females). The mean age was 5;3 (range = 4;5-5;11). These children were
bilingual in English and Mandarin and were recruited from various local kindergartens and childcare centers. Their families were given a token of appreciation
for participating in this study.
Bilingualism in Singapore. Singapore is a multicultural and multilingual country.

It has four official languages (English, Mandarin-Chinese, Tamil, and Malay).
A bilingual policy was adopted in 1966 and is considered to be fundamental to

Applied Psycholinguistics 35:1
So et al.: Discourse in bilingual children

75

Singapore's well-being (Pakir, 1998). According to this policy, every child should
learn English and one of the mother tongues. English is recognized as a "working
language" in education and work, while the rest of the official languages are
"mother tongues" of major ethnic groups (Dixon, 2005; Pakir, 1999).
Since 1987, English has been the sole medium of instruction for all content
subjects. In contrast, mother tongues have been taught as mandatory classroom
subjects but not used for teaching content subjects in all schools (Shepherd,
2005). English in the form of British Standard English was considered prestigious compared to the Singapore Colloquial English, which had evolved from
the schoolchildren of different language backgrounds in English schools in the
early part of the 20th century (Shepherd, 2005). Presently, the bilingual policy
has greatly improved the literacy rates of Singaporeans in English (Pakir, 1998).
However, among the Singaporean Chinese,2 there has been a decline in the standard of Mandarin Chinese. This is mainly because many of these children are
coming from English-speaking families. Hence, there is a trend that the majority
of Singaporean Chinese children are dominant in English over Mandarin.
Procedure

All data collection was conducted in the children's homes. For monolinguals, all
English- and Mandarin-speaking children were engaged in the spontaneous conversations with their caregivers. The caregivers were told that we were interested
in studying parent-child interactions during play and were asked to interact naturally with their children. The whole session was videotaped, and each lasted for
approximately 30 min. Of all English-speaking caregivers, four of them were the
children's mothers and two were the children's fathers. Of all Mandarin-speaking
caregivers, one of them was a child's grandmother, three were the children's mothers, and two were the children's fathers. All of them were monolingual children's
primary caregivers. A bag of gender-neutral toys, books, and puzzles was brought
for each session to facilitate the interaction.
For bilinguals, we began home visits by administering the self-reported Language Background Questionnaire (LBQ) that assessed the language dominance of
the children (Tan, 2010). LBQ required caregivers to (a) identify the caregivers
who looked after their children most of the time; (b) report which languages
mothers, fathers, and other main caregivers, such as maids, childcare teachers,
and grandparents, used with their children; (c) state the amount of time (out of
100%) they spent on each language with their children; (d) rank the children's language proficiency in English, Mandarin, and other languages; and (e) evaluate the
children's abilities to understand and speak in each language using a 7-point scale.
After completion of the questionnaire, all bilingual children were engaged in
spontaneous conversations with their caregivers. If primary caregivers were not
available on the date of data collection, other main caregivers who were present
were asked to interact with the children. Of all the caregivers of bilingual children
who were videotaped, eight of them were children's mothers and one was a
child's father. They were provided with the same instructions as the caregivers
of monolingual children except they were asked to interact with their children in
English for 30 min and in Mandarin for another 30 min. The order of language

was counterbalanced across caregivers. A bag of gender-neutral toys, books, and
puzzles was brought for each session.
Language dominance assessment in bilingual children

We determine children's language dominance based on the information reported
by caregivers in LBQ. Table 1 shows the summary of results. We expected that a
child's language dominance or proficiency would often be related to the amount of
time he/she was exposed to a particular language (Mayberry & Nicoladis, 2000).
Thus, we looked at the average amount of the time the parents and other main
caregivers spent speaking in English or Mandarin to their children.3 The score was
calculated as a form of percentage. For example, if a child's father and mother
each spoke English 80% of the time, her maid spoke English 90% of time, and
her grandparent did not speak English, she was considered as being exposed to
English 62.5%.
As shown in Table 1, the mean percentage of time exposed to English was
62.04% (SD = 11.64%, range = 45%-81.67%4 ), to Mandarin was 34.17%
(SD = 11.73%, range = 20%-50%), and to other languages was 3.80%
(SD = 8.75%, range = 0%-26.67%). In general, bilingual children were exposed
to English more often than Mandarin.
We also looked at how caregivers ranked their children's proficiency in each
language. As seen in Table 2, all caregivers ranked their children as most proficient
in English, followed by Mandarin. The mean proficiency score in understanding
in English was 6.11 (SD = 0.87); the score for understanding in Mandarin was
4.78 (SD = 0.92). The mean proficiency score for speaking in English was 6.00
(SD = 0.82) and that for speaking in Mandarin was 4.67 (SD = 0.67). Thus, the
proficiency scores in both understanding and speaking abilities in English were
generally higher than those for abilities in Mandarin. Overall, caregivers reported
that English was a more dominant language than Mandarin for their children.
Spoken language transcription and coding

All conversations between children and caregivers were transcribed by research
assistants who were native speakers of English and Chinese. Breaths, pauses, and
speech dysfluencies such as self-interruptions, self-corrections, and repetitions
were indicated in the transcripts. Speech that contained repetitions within one
conversational turn, unintelligible sounds, songs, nursery rhymes, or poems were
excluded from the analyses.
The remaining speech was segmented into utterances. Each utterance contained
a clause. Utterances containing more than one clause connected by a conjunction
(e.g., and, but, hai3 you2, bu2 guo4), were separated into two utterances. For the
purpose of present study, we only included the utterances containing third-person
referents5 (e.g., he, she, it, cat, ta1, mao1). Utterances produced by bilingual
children were classified into three different language categories according to the
language spoken: (a) English only (e.g., What is this?), (b) Chinese only (e.g.,
zhe4 ge4 shi4 mao1), and (c) mixed (e.g., zhe4 ge4 shi1 cat). Mixed utterances
were excluded from the analyses.

Each referent was assigned to one of the three categories according to its form
of referring expressions: (a) noun (e.g., deer, dog, lu4, gou3), (b) pronoun (e.g.,
he, she, it, ta1, this, that, zhe4 ge4, na4 ge4), and (c) null arguments. Third-person
referents were further classified into information status: a third-person referent was
considered given if it was mentioned somewhere in the preceding 20 utterances
and new if it had not been mentioned in the preceding 20 utterances (Chafe, 1987;
Du Bois, 1987).
Gesture transcription and coding

Hand movements were considered as gestures if they were used to express information to an interlocutor and did not involve any direct manipulation of objects (e.g.,
piecing a puzzle; scissors, paper, stone; Ozcaliskan & Goldin-Meadow, 2005).
Children's gestures were classified into the following types: (a) deictic gestures,
(b) iconic gestures, (c) emblems, and (d) speech beats. Deictic gesture involves
pointing at an object or person (e.g., index finger pointing at a rabbit, classified as a
reference to rabbit) or holding up an object in midair to bring it to the interlocutor's
attention (e.g., holding up a toy car, classified as a reference to toy car). Iconic
gesture represents an action or a shape of the object (e.g., flapping both hands
to indicate bird). Emblem is a conventional gesture whereby its meaning can be
recognized by the interlocutor even without accompanying speech (e.g., holding
up one finger to signify one). Speech beats are meaningless hand movements that
follow the rhythm of speech (e.g., child taps hand once in midair while saying, I'm
ready). Our analysis focused on the deictic and iconic gestures as they are always
produced along with speech and they can identify referents (McNeill, 1992; So,
Kita, & Goldin-Meadow, 2009; So et al., 2010).
All deictic and iconic gestures were then assigned semantic meaning (i.e.,
referents being conveyed). The semantic meaning of a gesture was determined
by its form in conjunction with the co-occurring speech. For example, two hands
flapping at the shoulders produced in conjunction with the utterance, "The bird
eats a worm," was assumed to refer to the bird. If a gesture was not accompanied
by an utterance containing a word that expressed its third-person referent, the
physical context or the form of gesture was used to determine its meaning. For
example, pointing at a puzzle referred to the puzzle; a curved palm moving toward
the mouth referred either to a glass or to an action of drinking.
The proportion of third-person referents conveyed in gestures was calculated as the total number of third-person referents conveyed in gestures, divided by the total number of third-person referents that could be expressed.6
All proportions were subjected to an arcsine transformation before statistical
analysis.
Reliability

We established reliability by having a second individual transcribe 20% of speech
utterances produced by monolingual English- and Chinese-speaking children and
English-Mandarin bilingual children, respectively. The second coder was a bilingual speaker in English and Mandarin and was trained to code speech and gesture.

in various aspects of speech and gesture coding.
RESULTS

This study aimed to examine whether English-Mandarin bilingual children
showed sensitivity to the discourse-pragmatic principle of information status in
their speech and gestures. If so, they should produce nouns to indicate new referents
and pronouns or null arguments (depending on respective languages) to indicate
given third-person referents. They should also gesture new third-person referents
more often than given third-person referents. In order to address these issues, we
compared the speech and gestures produced by English-Mandarin bilinguals to
those produced by English- and Mandarin-speaking monolingual children. We first
look at the ways monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children produced
speech and gestures to indicate given and new third-person referents.
Monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children

We only included the utterances containing third-person referents. Thus, we excluded 221 utterances produced by monolingual Mandarin-speaking children, and
151 utterances by monolingual English-speaking children. Table 4 (top) shows the
mean number of utterances, mean number of third-person referents, mean number
of given and new third-person referents, and mean number of third-person referents accompanied by iconic and deictic gestures in both groups of monolingual
children.
We first examine how monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children
conveyed third-person referents in speech. Figure 1 shows the distribution of types
of referring expressions produced by English- and Mandarin-speaking children.
The proportion of each type of the referring expressions for each speaker was
calculated as the total number of that form of referring expressions divided by
the total number of third-person referents that could be expressed. The majority
of referring expressions were nouns in both language groups. We conducted three
independent-sampled t tests, one for each type of the referring expression. The
proportion of null arguments was higher in Mandarin-speaking children than that
of null arguments in English-speaking children, t (10) = 2.75, p < .02. In contrast,
the proportion of pronouns in English-speaking children was greater than that of
pronouns in Mandarin-speaking children, t (10) = 1.83, p < .05. There was no
significant difference in the proportion of nouns between two language groups, t
(10) = .92, ns.
Next, we examined whether their speech followed the discourse principle of
information status of third-person referents. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the
different types of referring expressions that conveyed given and new third-person
referents in both Mandarin- and English-speaking children. We conducted three
separate, mixed analyses of variance (ANOVAs), one for each type of the referring expression, with mean proportion of referring expressions as the dependent
variable, language group (Mandarin, English) as the between-subject independent

variable, and information status (given, new) as the within-subject independent
variable.
For null arguments, there was a significant effect of language, F (1, 10) =
34.61, p < .001, a significant effect of information status, F (1, 10) = 24.38,
p < .001, and a significant interaction, F (1, 10) = 15.34, p < .01. In general,
Mandarin-speaking children produced null arguments more often than Englishspeaking children. Paired-sample t test showed that Mandarin-speaking children
produced null arguments more often when conveying given third-person referents
than when conveying new third-person referents, t (5) = 3.91, p < .01. However,
such difference was not found in English-speaking children, t (5) = 0.12, ns.
For pronouns, there was a significant effect of language, F (1, 10) = 6.01,
p < .04, no effect of information status, F (1, 10) = 2.34, ns, and a significant
interaction, F (1, 10) = 15.39, p < .01. Mandarin-speaking children tended to produce pronouns more often when conveying new third-person referents than when
conveying given third-person referents. The difference was marginally significant,
t (5) = 1.89, p < .07. However, such pattern was opposite in English-speaking
children; that is, English-speaking children produced pronouns more often when
conveying given third-person referents than when conveying new referents t (5) =
2.51, p < .03.
For nouns, there was no effect of language, F (1, 10) = 2.56, ns, a significant
effect of information status, F (1, 10) = 23.29, p < .001, and no interaction,
F (1, 10) = 1.34, ns. Children in both language groups tended to produce nouns
more often when conveying new third-person referents than when conveying given
third-person referents.
To summarize, our findings showed that monolingual children in both language
groups used less-specified referring expressions, that is, null arguments and pronouns, to indicate given third-person referents. Of all given third-person referents,

52% (SD = 11.13%) of them were conveyed in less-specified referring expressions
in Mandarin-speaking children. Similarly, 58% (SD = 10.08%) of given thirdperson referents were conveyed in less-specified referring expressions in Englishspeaking children. However, the type of less-specified referring expressions differed between two language groups. Monolingual Mandarin-speaking children
tended to use null arguments to indicate given third-person referents whereas
monolingual English-speaking children tended to use pronouns to indicate given
third-person referents. These findings showed that both Mandarin- and Englishspeaking children have acquired the language-specific rules in their argument
representation. In contrast, monolingual children in both language groups used

nouns to indicate new third-person referents, suggesting that they have mastered
the discourse principle of information status.
Finally, we examined whether their gestures followed the discourse principle
of information status of third-person referents as well. Children in both language
groups gestured. Figure 3 shows the proportion of given and new third-person
referents accompanied by gestures in Mandarin- and English-speaking children.
A mixed ANOVA with the mean proportion of third-person referents accompanied
by gestures as the dependent variable, language group (Mandarin, English) as the
between-subject independent variable, and information status (given, new) as
the within-subject independent variable, was conducted. There was no effect of
language, F (1, 10) = 1.19, ns, a significant effect of information status, F (1, 10) =
17.14, p < .01, and no interaction, F (1, 10) = 0.92, ns. Thus, children in both
language groups produced gestures more often when conveying new third-person
referents than when conveying given third-person referents.
To summarize, monolingual Mandarin- and English-speaking children showed
sensitivity to the discourse principle of information status both in their speech
and in gestures. Then, we look at the speech and gestures produced by English-
Mandarin bilinguals, asking whether they followed the discourse principle in both
languages.
English-Mandarin bilinguals

We only included utterances containing third-person referents, and thus we excluded 223 utterances spoken in English and 78 utterances spoken in Mandarin.
After excluding utterances not containing third-person referents, there were 55
mixed utterances (i.e., utterances containing both English and Mandarin); 821
utterances spoken in English; and 356 utterances spoken in Mandarin. For the

purpose of present study, we excluded mixed utterances and included Englishand Mandarin-only utterances that contained third-person referents.
Table 4 (bottom) shows the mean number of utterances, mean number of thirdperson referents, mean number of given and new third-person referents, and mean
number of third-person referents accompanied by iconic and deictic gestures produced by bilingual children when they were speaking in both languages. Note that
bilingual children produced significantly fewer utterances as well as third-person
referents when they were speaking in Mandarin than when they were speaking
in English, number of utterance, t (8) = 4.53, p < .01; number of new thirdperson referents: t (8) = 4.74, p < .01 (also see bottom of Table 4). Because of
such differences, the proportions of different types of referring expressions were
computed on highly variable sample sizes. In addition, the actual numbers of
different types of referring expressions were rather limited in Mandarin due to a
small language sample.7 Thus, the following analyses on the speech in Mandarin
should be interpreted with caution, especially when comparing English and Mandarin utterances produced by bilingual children and when comparing Mandarin
utterances of bilingual and monolingual children.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of different types of referring expressions in
bilingual children when they were indicating third-person referents in English and
Mandarin. Three paired-sample t tests were conducted for each type of referring
expressions. The proportion of null arguments was similar in both Mandarin and
English, t (8) = 0.23, p < ns. The proportion of pronouns was also similar in both
languages, t (8) = 0.91, p < ns. The proportion of nouns was slightly higher in
English than in Mandarin, but the difference did not reach significance, t (8) =
1.27, ns. As a result, the distribution of nouns, pronouns, and null arguments in
Mandarin was similar to that in English in bilinguals.

The way English-Mandarin bilingual children represented arguments in Mandarin was different from monolingual Mandarin-speaking children in two aspects.
First, the proportion of null arguments was significantly higher in monolingual
Mandarin-speaking children (26%) than in English-Mandarin bilingual children
(11%), t (14) = 3.43, p < .001. Second, the proportion of pronouns was significantly lower in monolingual Mandarin-speaking children (22%) than in English-
Mandarin bilingual children (40%), t (14) = 3.68, p < .001.
In contrast, the way English-Mandarin bilingual children represented arguments
in English was similar to that of monolingual English-speaking children. The
proportions of null arguments and pronouns in English-Mandarin bilingual children resembled those in monolingual English-speaking children: null arguments:
t (14) = 0.34, ns, pronouns: t (14) = 0.56, ns.
Altogether, bilingual children might have acquired language-specific rules in
argument representation in English but not in Mandarin. However, some of the
findings (especially those on the null arguments) might be difficult to interpret due
to small language sample in Mandarin (see Note 7).
We next ask whether English-Mandarin bilingual children showed sensitivity
to the discourse principle of information status in their speech. Figure 5 shows
the distribution of different types of referring expressions that conveyed given
and new referents in bilingual children when they were speaking in Mandarin and
English.
We conducted three separate, repeated measures ANOVAs, one for each type
of the referring expressions, with mean proportion of referring expressions as
the dependent variable, language group (Mandarin, English) as the within-subject
independent variable, and information status (given, new) as the within-subject independent variable. For null arguments, there was no effect of language, F (1, 8) =
0.98, ns, no effect of information status, F (1, 8) = 3.27, ns, and no interaction,
F (1, 8) = 0.28, ns. The proportion of null arguments referring to new third-person
referents appeared to be greater than that of null arguments referring to given
third-person referents in Mandarin, but the difference did not reach significance, t
(8) = 1.31, ns.
For pronouns, there was no effect of language, F (1, 8) = 1.28, ns, no effect
of information status, F (1, 8) = 0.89, ns, and significant interaction, F (1, 8) =
7.54, p < .03. To explore the interaction further, we conducted two paired-sample
t tests for Mandarin and English respectively. When speaking in Mandarin, the
proportion of pronouns referring to new third-person referents was higher than
that of pronouns referring to given third-person referents, t (8) = 1.97, p < .05.
Such pattern was opposite in English, that is, the proportion of pronouns referring
to new third-person referents was lower than that of pronouns referring to given
referents, t (8) = 1.91, p < .05.
For nouns, there was a significant effect of language, F (1, 8) = 7.45, p < .03,
no effect of information status, F (1, 8) = 0.63, p = ns, and significant interaction,
F (1, 8) = 9.48, p < .02. In general, the proportion of nouns was greater in English
than in Mandarin. When speaking in English, the proportion of nouns referring
to new third-person referents was greater than that of nouns referring to given
third-person referents. The difference was marginally significant, t (8) = 1.60,
p < .08. However, such pattern was opposite in Mandarin, that is, the proportion

of nouns referring to new third-person referents was smaller than that of nouns
referring to given third-person referents, t (8) = 1.91, p < .05.
Based on the small language sample in Mandarin, the proportion of null arguments referring to given third-person referents appeared to be similar to that of
null arguments referring to new third-person referents in bilinguals. By contrast,
the proportion of null arguments referring to given third-person referents was
greater than that of null arguments referring to new third-person referents in
monolingual Mandarin-speaking children. In addition, the proportion of nouns

referring to given third-person referents seemed to be higher than that of nouns
referring to new third-person referents in bilinguals. However, an opposite pattern
was observed in monolingual Mandarin-speaking children. In general, the way
English-Mandarin bilingual children produced null arguments and nouns to refer
to given and new referents might indicate that they have not yet mastered discourse
skills in Mandarin.
In contrast, English-Mandarin bilinguals seemed to show sensitivity to the discourse principle when they were speaking in English. The proportion of pronouns
referring to given third-person referents was higher than that of pronouns referring
to new third-person referents. In addition, the proportion of nouns referring to given
third-person referents was lower than that of nouns referring to new third-person
referents. These patterns were also observed in monolingual English children.
Finally, we ask whether the bilingual children followed the discourse principle
of information status when they gestured. Figure 6 displays the proportion of
given and new third-person referents accompanied by gestures in bilinguals when
they were speaking in Mandarin and English. We conducted a repeated measure
ANOVA with the proportion of expressions accompanied by gesture as the dependent variable, and information status (given, new) and language (English, Chinese)
as the within-subject independent variables. We found a significant effect of type
of the information status, F (1, 8) = 43.75, p < .001, no effect of language, F (1,
8) = 4.20, ns, and no interaction, F (1, 8) = 1.10, ns. Thus, the bilingual children
gestured new referents more often than given referents in both languages.
DISCUSSION

Our study explored whether bilingual children's speech and gesture followed
the discourse principle of information status when they were speaking in their
dominant (English) and less dominant (Mandarin) languages. We compared the

Applied Psycholinguistics 35:1

90

ways bilinguals used speech and gestures to indicate given and new third-person
referents to those of monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children. Our
findings showed that monolingual children in both language groups showed sensitivity to the discourse principle in both speech and gestures. English-Mandarin
bilingual children might also display sensitivity to the information status of thirdperson referents in speech when speaking in their dominant language but not in
their less-dominant language. Yet, they showed such sensitivity in gestures in both
languages. However, these findings were based on a relatively small language
sample in Mandarin in bilinguals.
Acquisition of language-specific rules in argument representation in English
and Mandarin

English is a nonnull argument language that requires arguments to be mentioned
in most of the situations (Bloom, 1990; Hyams & Wexler, 1993). In contrast,
Mandarin Chinese is a null argument language. Speakers can omit arguments,
but argument omission is constrained by the discourse factors (Huang, 1984;
Tsao, 1990). Our findings showed that Mandarin-speaking children omitted more
arguments than English-speaking children. Thus, monolingual children have acquired the language-specific rules in argument representation in their native languages in early childhood (see also Wang et al., 1992; Zheng & Goldin-Meadow,
2002).
Then did bilingual children in the present study show the language-specific
patterns in argument representation when speaking in both English and Mandarin,
compared to monolingual children? Our findings showed that, when bilingual
children were speaking in English, they omitted at more or less the same rate
as did monolingual English-speaking children. In contrast, when speaking in
Mandarin, they omitted significantly less frequently than monolingual Mandarinspeaking children. One possibility is bilingual children in the present study were
more dominant in English than in Mandarin. According to the language background information provided by their caregivers, these children were exposed to
English more frequently than Mandarin, and they were rated as as more proficient in English than in Mandarin. As a result, they might not have acquired
language-specific rules in argument representation in their weaker language,
Mandarin.
It is interesting that their omission rates in Mandarin and English were comparable. Hence, there might be cross-linguistic influence from English to Mandarin. In
other words, English-Mandarin bilinguals seemed to "transfer" language-specific
rules in argument representation from English to Mandarin. Previous research also
reported cross-linguistic influence from a language that does not generally allow
for omissions to one that is more flexible with omissions (Paradis & Navarro,
2003; Serratrice & Sorace, 2003; Serratrice, Sorace, & Paoli, 2004).
The role of information status in speech

Not only have young monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children acquired the language-specific patterns of argument representation, but they have

Applied Psycholinguistics 35:1
So et al.: Discourse in bilingual children

91

also mastered discourse skills in their respective languages. Our findings showed
that Mandarin-speaking children produced null arguments to refer to given thirdperson referents, while English-speaking children produced pronouns to refer to
given third-person referents. Both groups of children produced nouns to refer
to new third-person referents. These findings replicated So et al.'s (2010) findings that showed monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children produced
nonnouns (null arguments and pronouns) to refer to given third-person referents
and nouns to new third-person referents. So et al. also reported the same patterns
in first and second person referents. Hence, irrespective of the language they are
learning, monolingual children display sensitivity to the discourse principle of
information status in early childhood.
However, English-Mandarin bilingual children might not show the same level
of sensitivity to the information status of referents in both languages. They might
follow the discourse principle when they were speaking in their dominant language, English, but not in their less dominant language, Mandarin. Thus, their
Mandarin discourse skill might be weaker than their skill in English and that of
monolingual Chinese children. However, our findings might be affected by significant differences in the language sample sizes between English and Mandarin,
and thus they should be interpreted with caution. Future study should investigate
how the difference in language sample sizes might influence the patterns for the
third-person referents. In addition, a longitudinal study should be conducted to investigate whether bilingual children share the same path of discourse development
with monolingual children.
It is counterintuitive that bilingual children seemed to overspecify given referents (but underspecified new referents) when speaking in Mandarin. One possibility is that overspecification is one of the characteristics of language learners
who have not yet mastered discourse skills. Gullberg (2006) found that early
second-language adult learners tended to overspecify referents when speaking in
their weaker language. In addition to that, bilingual children might have limited
vocabularies to specify new referents in their less-dominant language. It might
be because they have had less exposure to Mandarin from caregivers. Thus, they
tended to use less-specified forms when indicating new referents. In order to verify
this, we should look at the new third-person referents that were underspecified
and track their referring forms of expressions throughout the discourse. By doing
that, we could examine whether the bilingual children used less-specified referring
expressions consistently to convey those referents. However, due to the small language sample in Mandarin in the present study, there was not a sufficient number
of new third-person referents for this analysis.
The role of information status in gestures

Our findings showed that monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children
gestured according to the discourse principle of information status. In particular,
they produced gestures more often when indicating new third-person referents than
when indicating given third-person referents. Such findings replicated previous
research that suggested monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking children
showed sensitivity to the discourse principle in their gestures (So et al., 2010).

Applied Psycholinguistics 35:1
So et al.: Discourse in bilingual children

92

Previous findings also showed that monolingual English- and Mandarin-speaking
caregivers produced gestures more often when asking their children to identify
new referents than given referents (So & Lim, in press).
English-Mandarin bilingual children also displayed sensitivity to discourse
in their gestures when speaking in both languages. Similar to English- and
Mandarin-speaking monolinguals, bilingual children produced gestures for new
third-person referents more often than given third-person referents. This finding was striking as it documented consistencies in cross-linguistic gestures even
though there were differences in third-person referencing in English and Mandarin
speech.
Why did bilinguals' gestures in both languages follow the discourse principle
of information status? One possibility is there was a "transfer" in gestures as from
English to Mandarin. In other words, the way bilingual children gestured when
they spoke in English influenced the way they gestured when they spoke in Mandarin. So (2010) recently examined cross-cultural transfer in gesture frequency
from English to Mandarin in English-Chinese bilinguals. In that study, monolingual English-speaking adults gestured more often than monolingual Mandarinspeaking adults. English-Chinese bilinguals gestured as frequently as English
monolinguals when speaking in English but gestured more often than Chinese
monolinguals when speaking in Mandarin. In addition, the gesture frequency in
both languages was similar to each other in bilinguals. These findings suggested
that gesture frequency seemed to transfer from English to Mandarin.
Another possibility is that gesture precedes speech in acquisition of discourse
skills. Previous research has shown that children who conveyed solutions to mathematics problems in their gestures (but not in speech) might have an idea of
how to solve these problems in their mental representation but they were not yet
ready to articulate it in speech (Goldin-Meadow and Singer (2003). Likewise,
the gestures produced by the English-Mandarin bilinguals in the present study
might reflect that they understood the discourse rule of information status of
Mandarin but that they were not ready to show such understanding in speech.
In fact, previous findings showed that gesture precedes language acquisition in
lexical and syntactic aspects (Capirci et al., 2005; Iverson & Goldin-Meadow,
2005; Ozcaliskan & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). Our study builds on this research by
extending the phenomenon to acquisition of discourse skills. Longitudinal study
should be conducted to examine when these English-Mandarin bilinguals master
the discourse principle in Mandarin.

Conclusion

To summarize, we have found that bilingual children follow the discourse principle
of information status in their speech when speaking in their dominant language.
However, they are not sensitive to the information status in their less-dominant
language, although the language sample in Mandarin is relatively small. It is
interesting that their gestures show sensitivity to the information status in both
languages, suggesting that gesture precedes language development at discourse
level in the less-dominant language in unbalanced bilinguals.

However, it is sometimes grammatical to omit the subject in the imperative clauses
(e.g., Eat up!) and in situations where contextual cues are present (e.g., Tell me what
you two have eaten for lunch).
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics, the population of Singapore
in 2000 was 77% Chinese, 14% Malays, 8% Indians, and the rest was other races
(Singapore Department of Statistics, 2000).
English score = sum of 80% (father) + 80% (mother) + 90% (maid) + 0% (grandparent) / 4. Note such method of calculation is based on the assumption that all caregivers
are equally weighted.
The child who was exposed to English 45% of time and Mandarin 50% of time could
be considered as a balanced bilingual. However, the pattern of findings was the same
when we removed this participant.
The analyses in the present study differ from those in So et al. (2010) in that here we
looked only at references to the third-person.
It included the referents that were realized by omission.
On average, there were 2.71 (SD = 1.39) null arguments, 10.02 (SD = 4.48) pronouns, and 14.34 (SD = 6.52) nouns conveying given referents in Mandarin; and 1.99
