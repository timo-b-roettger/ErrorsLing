INCIDENTAL L2 VOCABULARY
ACQUISITION FROM AND WHILE
READING
An Eye-Tracking Study

Previous studies have shown that reading is an important source of
incidental second language (L2) vocabulary acquisition. However,
we still do not have a clear picture of what happens when readers
encounter unknown words. Combining offline (vocabulary tests) and
online (eye-tracking) measures, the incidental acquisition of vocabulary knowledge from reading and the online reading of unknown lexical items were examined. L2 English learners read a story containing
unknown items while their eye movements were recorded. After eight
exposures, L2 readers recognized the form and the meaning of 86%
and 75% of the target nonwords, respectively, whereas they recalled
the meaning of 55% of the nonwords. After three to four encounters,
nonwords were read significantly faster, and by eight encounters
they were read in a similar manner to previously known real words.
Results also showed a positive relationship between new vocabulary
learning outcomes and online reading, with longer reading times
associated with higher vocabulary recall test scores. The study was
also conducted with first language (L1) readers to provide baseline
data for comparison. Results confirmed the L2 findings while also
indicating an interesting L1-L2 distinction in the rate rather than in the
ultimate outcome of the acquisition process.

Vocabulary knowledge is essential for fluent second language (L2) use.
Learners need a large amount of vocabulary to communicate successfully in a L2, with studies showing that, to reach successful comprehension of a wide range of written and spoken discourse, learners need to
know around 6,000 to 7,000 and 8,000 to 9,000 word families, respectively
(Nation, 2006).
A major concern of vocabulary research has therefore been to find
the most effective way of expanding learners' lexical knowledge. Vocabulary learning studies have followed two main research foci: (a) those
exploring the effect of intentional learning (i.e., learning that occurs
when there is a particular intention to do so; Barcroft, 2009) and (b) those
examining the effect of incidental learning (i.e., learning that occurs as a
result of using language with no particular intention to learn a particular
linguistic element; Schmitt, 2010).When these two approaches have
been compared, the advantage of intentional learning through explicit
teaching has been clear (e.g., Laufer, 2003; Lin & Hirsh, 2012). However,
explicit teaching cannot account for the huge amount of words that
learners need to know. This is when incidental acquisition from written
and spoken input comes into play.
BACKGROUND
Incidental Second Language Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading
The majority of studies investigating incidental vocabulary learning
have focused on the acquisition of new words from reading. Despite
some evidence suggesting the small effect of reading for vocabulary
learning (e.g., Laufer, 2005), there seems to be general agreement that
reading is an effective tool for increasing learners' vocabulary knowledge
(e.g., Krashen, 1989; Rott, 2007). Studies on incidental learning from
reading have traditionally focused on examining the acquisition of new
words and their meaning, usually by means of multiple-choice tests.
One of the earliest studies in the L2 context was Pitts, White, and
Krashen (1989). Using a multiple-choice meaning recognition test, these
authors investigated participants' acquisition of the nadsat (Russian
slang) vocabulary appearing in the first two chapters of A Clockwork
Orange. Results showed that, though modest (6.4-8.1% gains), there
was some vocabulary acquisition through reading. Similarly, Day,
Omura, and Hiramatsu (1991) found that both Japanese high school
and university students learnt a considerable number of new words
from reading a short passage, as measured by a meaning-focused,
multiple-choice test. Using the Vocabulary Levels Test format (Nation,
1983), Zahar, Cobb, and Spada (2001) found that their English as a L2
(ESL) participants learned about 8% of the target vocabulary from

reading a story. Higher percentages of vocabulary gains from reading
were found by Horst (2005), with her participants acquiring more than
half of the unfamiliar words that occurred in the reading materials.
However, vocabulary knowledge in this study was measured by a yes-no
test in which participants provided self-judgments of their lexical knowledge. These meaning-only and single-test studies showed some incidental acquisition of new words from reading, but they all suggest that
the gains are relatively modest.
However, although this receptive form-meaning level of lexical mastery
is perhaps the minimum amount of knowledge required to start using the
newly acquired vocabulary (at least receptively), there are many other
components of vocabulary knowledge that need to be mastered. Nation
(2001) provided the most comprehensive list to date of all the different
components of vocabulary knowledge, including aspects of form (e.g.,
written form, spoken form, word parts), meaning (e.g., form-meaning link,
concepts and referents, associations), and use (e.g., grammatical functions,
collocations, frequency). He also made a distinction between receptive
and productive levels of mastery of each of these components. Nation and
Webb (2011) highlight the need to address these aspects in vocabulary
learning studies using a variety of tests to: (a) measure different types
of knowledge learned and (b) measure the strength of that knowledge.
A small but growing number of studies have implemented this multicomponential approach and multitest approach in their designs. Horst,
Cobb, and Meara (1998) assessed the amount of vocabulary learned
from reading by L2 learners by means of a multiple-choice meaning recognition test and a word association test. Results showed that participants learned 22% of the words that could be learned, and they could
also build associations between them. Waring and Takaki (2003) examined incidental acquisition of the meaning of new words at both the
recognition and recall levels using a multiple-choice and a translation
task, respectively. Their Japanese participants recognized the meaning of
42% of the target words on the immediate multiple-choice test. However,
they were only able to provide a Japanese translation for 18% of the
items. After 3 months, the meaning recognition score dropped to 24%,
but the translation score dropped much more sharply to 4%, showing
that recognition knowledge was not only easier to acquire but it was also
retained better over time. Similar gains were found by Brown, Waring,
and Donkaewbua (2008). After reading a set of graded readers, participants were able to recognize the meaning of 45% of the 28 target words,
whereas they could only recall the meaning of 15% of those words. Recognition knowledge remained about the same after 3 months, whereas
recall knowledge dropped significantly. Assessing these two same components, Rott (1999) examined the number of words that L2 learners of
German acquired from reading short texts. Results of the immediate test
also showed better recognition knowledge than recall, with participants

100

being able to recall the meaning of 45% of the target items and recognize the meaning of 61% of the words after six exposures. These percentages remained the same after 1 week but dropped to 34% and 48%,
respectively, after 4 weeks.
The acquisition of spelling, meaning, and grammatical characteristics
was examined in Pigada and Schmitt's (2006) study. After 1 month of
extensive reading, their L2 learner of French showed some acquisition
of 65% of the words tested, with spelling being the most strongly enhanced
aspect and meaning and grammatical knowledge being enhanced to a
lesser degree. Four components were examined by Pellicer-Sanchez and
Schmitt (2010): form recognition, recall of grammatical class, meaning
recognition, and meaning recall. After more than 10 exposures in an
authentic novel, learners could recognize the meaning and form for
84% and 76% of the words, respectively, whereas they could recall the
meaning and word class for 55% and 63% of the words, respectively.
The most striking example of using a multitest approach to vocabulary research is the study conducted by Webb (2005). Vocabulary gains
from reading short sentence contexts were assessed by means of 10
different tests measuring five components (orthography, syntax, grammatical functions, association, and meaning-form) at the recognition and
recall levels. Results of the first experiment showed that, after reading
the 10 target words three times each in short sentence contexts, the
gain percentages shown in all postreading vocabulary tests were higher
than 73%. Each target item in this study was glossed, underlined, and
written in bold, which it can be assumed positively influenced the retention rate. These same five components were examined in a follow-up
study (Webb, 2007b). After reading short glossed sentence contexts, his
Japanese English as a foreign language (EFL) participants gained a considerable amount of knowledge of all the components measured, with
orthography and grammar recognition being the most enhanced aspects
(74%) and production of syntagmatic association the least improved
(38%). Using a similar methodology, these components were also examined in Webb's (2007a) study. After only one exposure in short contexts,
participants showed acquisition of all components investigated, with all
receptive scores between 40 and 70% and much lower productive scores
(9-50%). These percentages increased with increasing frequency. Overall,
the results of these studies showed substantial gains from reading and
better acquisition rates at the recognition than at the production level.
Webb's studies are a clear example of the advantages of using a multitest and multiaspect approach to vocabulary research.
Another major concern in vocabulary acquisition research has been the
effect of frequency of exposure. Previous studies have shown the positive
effect of frequency of exposure on the acquisition of new words from
reading, with higher frequencies being associated with stronger gains (e.g.,
Waring & Takaki, 2003; Zahar et al., 2001). In the first language (L1) context,

Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading

101

Saragi, Nation, and Meister (1978) found that the minimum number
of encounters for substantial vocabulary learning to occur was around 10.
In the L2 context, Rott (1999) found that, even though after two exposures learners' vocabulary growth was significantly affected, gains were
stronger after six exposures. Horst and colleagues (1998) found that target
words needed to appear at least eight times for substantial gains to occur.
Nation and Wang (1999) claimed that after 10 encounters words were more
likely to be learned, although this did not guarantee acquisition. Pigada
and Schmitt (2006) also found that by about 10+ exposures, there was a
considerable increase in vocabulary learning. This 10+ figure was also confirmed by Pellicer-Sanchez and Schmitt (2010) and Webb (2007a). Results
of these studies seem to suggest that, for reliable learning of several lexical
aspects, words need to be met around eight to 10 times.
These and other studies (e.g., Grabe & Stoller, 1997; West, Stanovich, &
Mitchell, 1993) have shown that L2 learners can acquire new words incidentally from reading, provided that they encounter the new vocabulary
enough times within a limited time span. However, these previous studies
assessed lexical knowledge using offline postreading tasks. Their findings, although informative, do not tell us much about what happens when
learners find unfamiliar words while reading. This question has been
addressed by other studies using think-aloud protocols (e.g., Bengeleil &
Paribakht, 2004; Fraser, 1999; Huckin & Bloch, 1993; Paribakht & Wesche,
1999) or retrospective interviews (e.g., Godfroid & Schmidtke, 2013).
Most of these studies have shown that, when encountering unknown
words in reading, L2 learners try to figure out their meaning by means of
lexical inferencing (i.e., "guessing the meaning of an unfamiliar word
using available linguistic and other cues" [Bengeleil & Paribakht, 2004,
p. 225]) and that context-based strategies are most typically used when
generating their guesses. However, other studies have shown low rates of
success from lexical inferencing (e.g., Nassaji, 2003).
These studies provide further insight into the process of vocabulary
learning from reading. However, think-aloud protocols on their own capture only traces of the cognitive processes taking place (Huckin & Bloch,
1993). We still do not know how those unknown words are read in context, how that reading behavior changes as an effect of frequency, or how
that reading behavior relates to learning rates. These questions can now
be addressed by combining online eye-tracking methodology and offline
reading tests.

Eye Movements and Word Recognition in Reading
The investigation of eye movements using eye-tracking methodology is
a common research tool in psychology and psycholinguistics, and there

102

Ana Pellicer-Sanchez

has recently been a growing interest in the use of this technique in applied
linguistics research. Eye-tracking methodology has received special
attention in reading research. Eye movements are "an inherent behavioural manifestation of the reading process in action" (Radach & Kennedy,
2004, p. 4). A vast number of research studies have investigated eye
movements while reading and processing information.1
While reading, we move our eyes in a sequence of saccades (i.e., very
rapid movements), and these saccades are interrupted by fixations
(i.e., periods of relative stability). It is during eye fixations that visual
information can be extracted (Radach & Kennedy, 2004). When reading,
readers go back to read parts of the text that have already been read
10% to 15% of the time (i.e., they make a regression; Rayner, 1997).
In the examination of eye movements a distinction has been made
between temporal measures (such as fixation durations), which are
believed to be indicators of processing load, and spatial measures
(such as fixation position and saccade amplitudes), which are indicators
of the direction and the sequence of processing (Radach & Kennedy,
2004). Some of the most frequently used measures of processing time
include
* First fixation duration, or the duration of the first fixation on a word or region
of interest;
* First pass reading time or gaze duration, which is the sum of all fixations made
on a word or region of interest before exiting the area or word either to
the left or to the right;
* Fixation count, or the number of all fixations made on a word or region of
interest; and
* Total reading time, or the sum of all fixation durations made on a word or
region of interest.

Figure 1 shows these four measures and hypothetical patterns of eye
movements in a sample sentence from the reading text used in this study.
Deciding which one is the best measure of processing time (when
the unit of analysis is a single word) is a controversial issue (Rayner,
1998). Rayner (1998) points out that using a single measure of processing time per word is inappropriate, and he recommends the use of several measures as a way of drawing reasonable inferences about the
reading processes. Earlier measures of first fixation duration and gaze
duration are believed to tap into initial lexical access, whereas later
measures of the number of fixations and total reading time are believed
to reflect higher order processes like semantic integration (Libben &
Titone, 2009).
When we read, about 30% of the words in a text are not fixated
(Rayner & Juhasz, 2004). Short words are skipped more frequently than
longer words (Rayner & McConkie, 1976), and high-frequency words are

103

Figure 1. Sample sentence with eye-tracking measures (format of the
figure based on Siyanova-Chanturia et al., 2011).
skipped more frequently than low-frequency words (Rayner, Sereno, &
Raney, 1996). The fact that words are not fixated does not mean that
they are not processed (Rayner, 1998). Due to the speed that characterizes saccades, there is no useful information acquired during saccades.
Instead, readers acquire information during fixations (Wolverton & Zola,
1983). Fixation durations are related to the ease or difficulty with which
words in a text are comprehended (Rayner, 1997, 1998; Rayner & Pollatsek,
1989). When readers encounter a novel word, they spend more initial
processing time on those novel words than on familiar words (Chaffin,
Morris, & Seely, 2001; Godfroid, Boers, & Housen, 2013; Williams & Morris,
2004).
These reading patterns are influenced by a number of lexical, semantic,
and contextual features.2 Some of these lexical features include orthographic regularity (e.g., Radach, Inhoff, & Heller, 2004); orthographic
familiarity (e.g., White & Liversedge, 2004); length, frequency, and predictability (e.g., Kliegl, Grabner, Rolfs, & Engbert, 2004); word frequency
(e.g., Rayner, 1998; Rayner et al., 1996); word familiarity (e.g., Williams &
Morris, 2004); age of acquisition (e.g., Juhasz & Rayner, 2006); and lexical ambiguity (e.g., Rayner & Frazier, 1989). In general, increased regularity and familiarity, higher predictability and frequency, as well as
shorter length, have been found to lead to shorter fixation durations
and fewer fixations. Another factor having an important effect on the
reading of fixated words is repetition. Hyona and Niemi (1990) investigated the process of repeated reading and found that repeated exposures to the same text led to a decrease in fixation durations, number of
fixations, and number of regressions. Results showed that, with increased
repetitions, reading times on fixated words decreased. This decrease in

104

Ana Pellicer-Sanchez

reading times in repeated reading is explained by the authors as an effect
of the increased familiarity of both the surface features and the content of
the text. When readers are exposed to an already-read text, both the visuographic features and the content of the text become more familiar, which
leads to the decrease in reading times. Hyona and Niemi (1990) interpret
this finding as a suggestion that both low-level processes (i.e., visuographic
features of the text) and higher level comprehension processes are responsible for eye guidance during reading, supporting the view that readers'
eyes are guided by both visual and cognitive information.

Eye Movements in Vocabulary Acquisition Research
Eye-tracking methodology has been used to investigate several phenomena in L1 and L2 reading, such as sentence processing (e.g., Altarriba,
Kroll, Scholl, & Rayner, 1996), the processing of formulaic language
(e.g., Siyanova-Chanturia, Conklin, & Schmitt, 2011), and noticing of corrective feedback (e.g., Smith, 2012). However, only a few studies have
used eye-tracking methodology to investigate the process of vocabulary
learning from reading.
Chaffin and colleagues (2001) examined L1 readers' eye movements
when learning meanings of novel words from sentence contexts. They
found longer initial and total reading times for novel words as compared
to high-familiarity words. However, they did not use any postreading
measure to assess whether participants had indeed learned the meaning
of those novel items.
Williams and Morris (2004) measured both participants' eye movements while reading words of different degrees of familiarity in sentence
contexts and participants' vocabulary learning from reading by means
of postreading vocabulary tests. Overall, results showed a systematic
relationship between online processing patterns and memory for new
words. However, they found a different and conflicting effect of early
and late measures on postreading vocabulary scores. Shorter first pass
reading times were associated with higher accuracy in the vocabulary
tests, whereas longer second pass reading times were shown for words
that were correctly answered in the vocabulary test. This negative relationship between first pass reading time and vocabulary learning scores,
which could not be accounted for by the authors, has been explained
as a possible effect of other confounding factors such as word length
(Godfroid et al., 2013). One main limitation of this study is that it investigated reading in short sentence contexts and, because vocabulary
learning was only a secondary focus of the study, it was measured by
means of a two-choice synonym recognition test, using only an immediate
measure of vocabulary retention.

Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading

105

In the L2 context, Godfroid and colleagues (2013) also used eye-tracking
to examine the process of learning unknown vocabulary from reading.
Twenty-eight EFL students read 20 short paragraphs containing pseudowords (e.g., paniplines) while their eye movements were recorded. After
the reading task, they completed a multiple-choice gap-filling exercise.
Participants were presented with the experimental paragraphs they had
seen in the reading task with the difference that the target pseudoword
had been removed. Their task was to fill the gap with one of the 18 options
provided. They found that total reading time was a significant predictor
of the probability of posttest recognition, with longer reading times being
associated with better recognition scores.
In addition to the scarcity of studies using eye-tracking to investigate
vocabulary acquisition from reading, most of the studies available used
vocabulary tests that did not provide a good representation of the depth
of vocabulary knowledge that accrues from reading. Furthermore, none
of these studies explored the effect of repetition in the online reading of
the unknown items.
Following a multicomponential and multitest approach and combining
online measures of eye-tracking and offline vocabulary tests, the present study examined both the incidental acquisition of knowledge of
unknown items (word form and meaning) from reading and the online
reading of those items in context. Participants read a story containing
unknown vocabulary while their eye movements were recorded. To
explore the role of frequency of exposure in participants' reading of
unknown vocabulary, all target items were repeated eight times. After
the reading, participants completed several vocabulary tests to assess
their knowledge of the unknown vocabulary. Another component of
vocabulary knowledge that was examined in this study was the degree
of certainty of participants' responses. It seems obvious to claim that
the better or more consolidated one's knowledge of a word, the higher
the degree of certainty of that knowledge. Wesche and Paribakht (2000),
in their investigation of different text-based vocabulary exercises using
think-aloud protocols, found that in some cases learners reported greater
certainty in their knowledge of some target words. Confidence ratings
have indeed been previously used in the implicit-explicit learning literature as a way of dissociating conscious and unconscious knowledge of
grammar (Rebuschat, 2013). However, this subjective measure appears
not to have been examined in vocabulary studies in a systematic way.
So far, research on vocabulary acquisition from reading has been
able to shed light on the quantity and quality of words that are acquired
incidentally from reading. However, by combining both online and offline
measures, we can also examine how unknown items are recognized while
reading. The combination of both methods of assessment should provide
a fuller account of L2 learners' reading behavior and of their incidental
vocabulary acquisition from reading.

106

Ana Pellicer-Sanchez

The following questions were addressed:
1. Do L2 learners acquire vocabulary knowledge incidentally from reading, as
measured by the offline vocabulary tests?
2. How does the reading of unknown items in context change across several
encounters, as measured by the online measures?
3. Is there a relationship between the online reading of lexical items and vocabulary
knowledge?

To provide a fuller examination of the process of L2 vocabulary learning
from reading, the study was also conducted with L1 readers. The comparison with L1 baseline data allows us to examine whether the reading
patterns observed in the L2 acquisition process are also found with
L1 readers. Ultimately, this comparison allows us to find out whether
L2 readers benefit from the reading activity in a similar way to L1
readers.

METHOD
Participants
Thirty-seven L2 speakers of English from various language backgrounds
and 36 L1 speakers of English initially participated in this study. Due to
cases of drift (i.e., imprecise eye movements indicating a deterioration
of the calibration over time) in the areas under examination, data from
14 L2 participants and 11 L1 participants were discarded. Data from
23 L2 participants (10 males; 13 females) and 25 L1 participants (1 male;
24 females) were included in the analysis.
L1 participants were undergraduate students at a U.K. institution,
and their ages ranged from 19 to 21 years (M = 19.4). L2 participants
were postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers at a U.K.
university. They were from 11 different language backgrounds (nine
participants from alphabetic languages; six from logographic languages; and five from syllabic languages or abugidas). Their ages
ranged from 22 to 42 years (M = 27). They all had spent a minimum of
12 months and a maximum of 6 years living in an English-speaking
environment (M = 2.4 year; SD = 1.7 years). They were advanced
learners who had met the university entry requirement of English
proficiency (6.0 or above on the International English Language
Testing System [IELTS] or equivalent examination). At the beginning
of the experiment L2 participants completed a self-rating test of
proficiency (on a scale from 1 to 10) in English.3 Table 1 shows
that the mean values for all skills were above 7, and all participants
rated their reading skills at 7 or above. L2 participants received

a small compensation for their participation, and L1 participants

Reading Materials
A short story (2,300 words) was written for the study. Because text
comprehension influences vocabulary learning from reading (e.g., Pulido,
2004), vocabulary in the story was controlled to ensure that potential
acquisition of the unknown items would not be hindered by lack of
knowledge of the remaining items in the text. Of the words in the story,
96.82% belonged to the 3,000 most frequent words of the British National
Corpus (BNC; determined by Compleat Lexical Tutor; Cobb, n.d.).
Only four words (.17%) were from the 5,000 to 9,000 frequency bands.
These were considered adequate percentages to ensure participants'
comprehension.
Six nonwords and six control words (real known words) were inserted
in the story, each repeated eight times. Having 48 unknown items (2.09%)
in the text still maintained the 98% coverage that has been claimed to
enable adequate comprehension (Hu & Nation, 2000). This percentage of
nonwords ensures comprehension even for participants who may not
learn any of the target items throughout the eight encounters. Nonwords
were spread to ensure a balanced distribution of unknown items throughout the story. The story was presented on a computer screen (Courier
New font, size 18) and divided over 25 screens. The text presented on
each screen had a similar length (eight lines; 82-103 words). All screens
contained a maximum of two nonwords (23 screens contained two nonwords, and the first and last screens contained only one nonword). The
position of target and control items in the text was carefully controlled so
that none of the items would be in initial or final position in a line or sentence, because previous research has shown that the first fixation on a
line tends to be longer (e.g., Rayner, 1977).
A true-false comprehension test containing 12 statements assessed
participants' comprehension.4 None of the target items appeared in any
of the comprehension questions. A shorter (five screens, 423 words)

108

Ana Pellicer-Sanchez

but similar story (also containing unknown items) and comprehension
test were created for a practice session.

Target Items
To ensure lack of previous knowledge of the target items, nonwords
(i.e., invented letter strings that look like real words in English) were
used. Nonwords were selected from the list developed by Meara and his
colleagues and available from Compleat Lexical Tutor (Cobb, n.d.) and
modified to suit the required length (two syllables, six letters). They all
replaced high-frequency (1,000-3,000 from the BNC), concrete nouns in
the text.
After an initial pilot with 10 native and 10 nonnative speakers of
English, the candidate nonwords for the study were: holter "house,"
berrow "bowl," bancel "prisoner," cambul "ring," twoser "noise," and
soters "clothes." To make sure that all nonwords were equally guessable from the contexts in which they appeared, they were again
piloted with 87 native speakers of English divided in eight groups.
Group 1 read the first context in which each of the nonwords
appeared (including the nonword sentence, the previous sentence,
and the following sentence), Group 2 read contexts 1 and 2, Group 3
read contexts 1 through 3, and so forth. Participants were asked to
read the paragraphs and guess the meaning of the nonwords. This
pilot study made it possible to check those cases in which several
meanings should be considered correct for the same item. For
example, bancel was guessed as criminal and prisoner, and both meanings fit all contexts. These two options were considered accurate
guesses. A similar case was found for holter. It was initially inserted
as house, but other possible meanings were workhouse, orphanage,
or shelter. Results also showed that the vast majority of participants
provided the same accurate guesses (holter: 93% of the participants,
bancel: 98%, twoser: 97%, soters: 98%, cambul: 100%, berrow: 98%).
These percentages were considered a good indication of the similar
degree of informativeness of the contexts in which target words were
embedded.
To compare the reading behavior of these unknown words with that
of already known words and to make sure that any effect observed
was not a practice effect that would have also been observed with
known words, six control items were included in the story and also
repeated eight times. These were real words with the same characteristics as the targets (nouns, six letters, and two syllables). They were
all high-frequency words (1,000-3,000 from the BNC): garden, master,
mother, dinner, worker, and secret.

Measurement Instruments
For the online measures, participants' eye movements were monitored
using a head-mounted SMI Eyelink I eye-tracker manufactured by SR
Research. The following four measures were examined: first fixation
duration, gaze duration, number of fixations, and total reading time.
For the offline measures, three vocabulary tests were used: form recognition, meaning recall, and meaning recognition. The first vocabulary
test assessed participants' ability to recognize the correct form of the
target items. A multiple-choice test presented four different options,
and participants were asked to select the correct spelling of the target
items. The second test measured participants' ability to recall the
meaning of the target items. Participants were shown the target items
one-by-one and were asked to say everything they knew about the
meaning of the item. A third and easier measure of the form-meaning
link (i.e., meaning recognition) was included to capture knowledge
below the level of meaning recall (Schmitt, 2010). A multiple-choice
item was designed for each word, consisting of the target item and five
possible options: three distractors, the correct meaning, and an "I don't
know" option. Careful attention was given to the design of distracters,
which were all semantically related to the content of the story (otherwise
their discrimination would have been too easy) and were all of the same
word class. In the three tests, participants also had to indicate on a
scale from 1 to 4 how certain they were of their responses (1 = very
uncertain, 4 = very certain; see Appendix).

Procedure
Experiments took place individually in a psycholinguistics laboratory.
At the beginning of the session L2 participants completed a language
background questionnaire. After setting up the eye-tracker, participants
were asked to read the story as naturally as possible for comprehension. They were aware that there would be postreading comprehension
questions, but they were not aware of the presence of nonwords in the
story. After the explanation of the procedure, a nine-point grid calibration was completed. Before completing the experimental reading task,
participants read a practice story and answered five comprehension
questions. Another calibration was completed between the practice and
experimental trials, and another halfway through the experiment. Before
each new screen, a fixation point appeared at the left of the screen.
After participants had fixated the point and a calibration check was made,
the story appeared on the screen. To proceed from one screen to the
next, participants had to press the "Enter" button on the keyboard.

During the reading participants could not go back to previously read
screens. After reading the story, the true-false comprehension questions appeared one-by-one on the screen. Participants had to respond
by pressing the "yes" and "no" buttons on the keyboard. After the
comprehension questions, participants completed the vocabulary
tests. The first (form recognition) and last (meaning recognition) tests
were completed individually in paper format. The second test (meaning
recall) was conducted by means of a personal interview. The researcher
showed participants A3-size index cards with each of the target items
and asked them to say everything they knew about their meaning. The
whole procedure lasted around 45 min. The three vocabulary tests
were scored using the same system (1 = correct response, 0 = incorrect
response). Partially correct responses were not scored. Given the
immediate nature of the posttest and the small number of items in the
study, a stricter approach to the scoring of responses was considered a
more reliable indication of true vocabulary gains in the study.
L2 participants were invited to attend a second session. A delayed
posttest session took place in the same location 2 weeks after the first
session. Participants were not aware of the content of the second session. Only the offline tests were administered, following the procedure
outlined previously. The whole session lasted around 15 min.
The exact same procedure was followed with L1 and L2 participants,
with the only difference being that, for practical limitations, L1 participants
could not complete the delayed testing session. Only results of the immediate test will be reported for L1 readers.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Offline Measures
Results of the comprehension test showed proper comprehension of
the text by both L2 and L1 participants (L2 participants: M = 11.22,
SD = 1.09, Min = 8; L1 participants: M = 11.32, SD = .85, Min = 9). Results
of independent-samples t tests showed that there was no significant
difference between L1 and L2 scores, t(46) = .37, p = .719. Both L1 and L2
readers showed very similar levels of comprehension.
A one-way within-groups ANOVA was conducted to compare participants' performance on the three vocabulary tests (see means in Table 2).
Results indicated that there was an overall significant difference in the
scores of the vocabulary tests, F(2, 44) = 12.85, p < .001. Post hoc tests
using the Bonferroni correction showed that, after eight encounters, L2
participants were able to recognize the form of the target items significantly better than to recall their meaning (p < .001) and that they
were able to recognize their meaning significantly better than to recall

it (p < .001). The difference between form recognition and meaning
recognition was not significant (p = .459). Interestingly, out of the total
number of unknown responses in the meaning recall test (54 unknown
responses), 26% of the responses (14 cases) were ones in which the
meanings were recalled correctly but linked to the wrong word. This
could be an indication that participants had some initial productive
knowledge of the meaning of the target items in place but failed to make
the appropriate form-meaning link.
Results of a one-way within-groups ANOVA with the L1 baseline data
also showed that there was an overall significant difference in the vocabulary test scores, F(2, 48) = 30.28, p < .001, with meaning recall being the
most difficult aspect to be acquired and the two recognition aspects
being the easiest. Post hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni correction
showed that, after eight encounters, L1 participants were able to recognize the form and the meaning of the target items significantly better than
to recall their meaning (p < .001). The difference between form recognition and meaning recognition was not significant (p = .550).
Independent-samples t test analyses showed that there was no significant difference between L1 and L2 participants in the acquisition
of these three components of lexical mastery (form recognition: t[46] =
1.28, p = .206; meaning recognition: t[46] = .61, p = .543; meaning recall:
t[46] = 1.69, p = .097).
A nonparametric Friedman test (data not normally distributed) was
used to compare participants' degree of certainty on the three different
tests (see mean values in Table 3). Results showed that there was a
significant difference in certainty scores across the three tests, 2(2) =
10.92, p = .004. A post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests was
conducted with a Bonferroni correction applied (resulting significance
level at p < .017), and results showed that the difference between L2
participants' certainty for meaning recognition was significantly higher
than for meaning recall, Z = -3.45, p < .001, and for form recognition,
Z = -3.48; p < .001. These results suggest that meaning recognition is not

only one of the easiest aspects to acquire (when compared to meaning
recall), but it is also a type of knowledge for which participants seem to
be more certain. This is not surprising, given the multiple-choice nature
of the meaning recognition test. In contrast, meaning recall is not only a
difficult aspect to acquire, but, even when acquired, certainty for that
knowledge may be more difficult to achieve.
Similarly, results of the Friedman test with L1 baseline data showed
that there was a significant difference in participants' certainty levels
(see mean values in Table 3), 2(2) = 17.61, p < .001. A post hoc analysis
with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (using the Bonferroni adjusted alpha
value) showed that L1 readers were also significantly more certain
about their ability to recognize the meaning of the words than about
their ability to recall the meaning, Z = -4.57, p < .001, and their ability to
recognize the correct form, Z = -2.42, p = .016. Meaning recall was also
the component with the lowest degree of certainty for L1 readers.
These gains come from an immediate test, and thus it is not surprising
that participants were able to show knowledge of the target items. Results
of the delayed test with L2 participants should give a better indication
of durable lexical learning. Only 14 L2 participants out of the initial 23
completed the delayed test. The generalizability of results is therefore
less robust. Results of the one-way within-subjects ANOVA showed a
significant difference in the scores of the delayed tests (see mean values
in Table 2), F(2, 26) = 10.88, p < .001. Results of the post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction showed a very similar pattern to that of
the immediate test, with scores for meaning recall being significantly
lower than meaning recognition and form recognition (p < .001). Results
of paired-samples t tests also showed that the differences between the
immediate and delayed posttests were not significant (form recognition:
t[13] = -.37, p = .720; meaning recall: t[13] = .29, p = .775; Meaning recognition: t[13] = .82, p = .426).
The possibility of test effect needs to be considered. The vocabulary
knowledge shown in the delayed test may have been a consequence not
only of the vocabulary learned incidentally from reading but also of the
additional focused exposure to the target items in the immediate test.
However, because participants did not know about the content of the

Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading

113

delayed test and they did not encounter the target items in the 2 weeks
between the two testing sessions, results are still a good indication of
durable learning 2 weeks after the initial exposure.
In response to the first research question, results of the present study
have shown that, after having encountered the unknown items eight
times in a text, L2 and L1 participants learned a considerable number of
those items and that, for L2 readers, this percentage of learning seemed
to persist after 2 weeks. Results of the offline measures have shown no
significant differences between the behavior of L1 and L2 readers, suggesting that the advanced L2 readers in this study benefitted from the
reading activity in the same way as L1 readers. L1 and L2 participants
acquired a similar amount and type of vocabulary from reading and
were similarly certain about the acquired knowledge.

Online Measures
Participants' reading behavior for target and control items was analyzed. Four measures were examined: first fixation duration, gaze duration, number of fixations, and total reading time. Single fixation durations
shorter than 100 ms and longer than 800 ms were discarded. Fixation
counts greater than or equal to 10 were also discarded (Morrison, 1984).
This resulted in the loss of 5% of the L2 data (218 fixations out of the
total 3,824 fixations) and 6.5% of the L1 data (227 fixations out of the
total 3,262 fixations).5
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality showed that the data was
not normally distributed. Results of nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests
demonstrated that, as shown by previous studies (e.g., Chaffin et al.,
2001; Godfroid et al., 2013; Williams & Morris, 2004), in the case of L2
readers, mean reading times for targets were significantly longer than
for controls in all four measures examined (first fixation duration: 2[1] =
21.61, p < .001; gaze duration: 2[1] = 35.59, p < .001; number of fixations:
2[1] = 65.24, p < .001; total reading time: 2[1] = 80.93, p < .001; see mean
values in Table 4).
Kruskal-Wallis tests were also conducted to explore the effect of
repetition on the four eye-tracking measures. When examining reading
times across the eight encounters, it was observed that both controls
and targets experienced a decrease. For targets, the effect of repetition
was significant in all measures (gaze duration: 2[7] = 34.38, p < .001;
number of fixations: 2[7] = 67.13, p < .001; total reading time: 2[7] =
76.46, p < .001), except for first fixation duration, 2(7) = 13.38, p = .063,
whereas for controls it was only significant in two measures, number of
fixations, 2(7) = 24.87, p < .001, and total reading time, 2(1) = 17.43, p = .015.
There was no significant effect of repetition among the eight frequency

groups for first fixation duration, 2(7) = 9.30, p = .232, or gaze duration,
2(7) = 5.38, p = .614 (Table 4).
Both targets and controls experienced a decrease in reading times in
some of the measures examined. This was expected due to a general
repetition effect, as found by previous studies (e.g., Hyona & Niemi, 1990;
Rayner, Raney, & Pollatsek, 1995). However, the decrease for target items
was greater and significant in a higher number of measures.
Results of Kruskal-Wallis tests with the L1 baseline data showed
that, as was the case with L2 learners, mean reading times for targets
were significantly longer than for controls in all four measures examined (first fixation duration: 2[1] = 25.33, p < .001; gaze duration:
2[1] = 33.31, p < .001; number of fixations: 2[1] = 67.18, p < .001; total
reading time: 2[1] = 76.43, p < .001; see mean values in Table 5). KruskalWallis tests were also run to examine the effect of repetition on the
four eye-tracking measures. Both controls and targets experienced a
decrease across the eight encounters. For targets, the effect of repetition was significant in all measures (first fixation duration: 2[7] = 22.75,
p = .002; gaze duration: 2[7] = 56.32, p < .001; number of fixations:
2[7] = 73.42, p < .001; total reading time: 2[7] = 72.66, p < .001), whereas
for controls it was significant in three out of the four measures (gaze
duration: 2 [7] = 15.11, p = .035; number of fixations: 2[7] = 36.81, p < .001;
total reading time: 2[7] = 37.63, p < .001; first fixation duration: 2[7] = 6.12,
p = .526; Table 5).
Post hoc comparisons were run with Mann-Whitney tests applying
the Bonferroni correction (.05/7 = .007). The fixation times and number
of fixations at the first encounter were compared to fixation times and
number of fixations at each subsequent encounter. Results showed
that, in the case of L2 readers, the decrease in gaze duration for targets
started to be significant from the third encounter, Z = -3.18, p = .002, r = .47.
In the case of number of fixations and total reading time, it was not until
the fourth encounter that the effect of frequency of exposure started to
be significant (number of fixations: Z = -2.85, p = .004, r = .42; total reading
time: Z = -3.59, p < .001, r = .53). Overall, after three to four encounters,
I found a significant decrease in three of the four measures examined.
The decrease in the number of fixations for control words was not significant until the seventh encounter, Z = -3.64, p < .001, r = .54, and total
reading time for controls was not significant until the fifth encounter,
Z = -2.97, p = .003, r = .44.
Post hoc comparisons with Mann-Whitney tests with the L1 baseline
data (adjusted alpha value = .007) showed that, for targets, the decrease in
first fixation duration started to be significant after the fourth encounter,
Z = -2.81, p = .005, r = .40. However, in the other three measures examined,
the effect of frequency started to be significant earlier. The effect in
gaze duration started to be significant from the third encounter,
Z = -2.70, p = .007, r = .38, and, in the case of number of fixations and

Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading

total reading time, a significant effect was observed after the first
encounter (number of fixations: Z = -3.25, p = .001, r = .50; total reading
time: Z = -3.74, p < .001, r = .53). It only took L1 readers one or two
encounters for their reading behavior to show a significant effect of repetition in three of the four measures examined. The decrease in the
number of fixations and total reading time for controls was not significant
until the fifth encounter (number of fixations: Z = -4.14, p < .001, r = .59;
total reading time: Z = -3.60, p < .001, r = .51).
The effect of repetition on reading behavior was also explored by
means of nonparametric correlation analyses. Results for L2 participants in Table 6 showed that the same pattern of results was found
for controls, with significant, negative, and small correlations in only
two measures (i.e., number of fixations and total reading times). For
targets, results showed a significant negative correlation between
frequency of exposure and all four measures examined, with a higher
number of exposures being associated with shorter reading times
and a lower number of fixations. Spearman correlation coefficients
clearly showed that the negative relationship between frequency of
exposure and reading times was stronger for the target words. Results
of correlation analyses suggest a clearer and stronger effect of frequency
of exposure for targets, both in terms of the strength of the correlation and in terms of the number of measures for which a significant
correlation was found.
In line with L2 findings, results showed that, in the case of L1 readers,
both targets and controls experienced a decrease in reading times in
some of the measures examined, with the decrease for target items

being greater and significant in a higher number of measures. Nonparametric correlation analyses confirmed these patterns by suggesting a
clearer and stronger effect of repetition for targets, both in terms of the
strength of the correlation and in terms of the number of measures for
which a significant correlation was found (Table 6).
Nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests were also conducted between
mean reading times for L1 and L2 readers (see Tables 4 and 5 for mean
values), and results showed that, in all measures examined, L1 readers
were significantly faster when reading both targets (first fixation duration: Z = -7.79, p < .001; gaze duration: Z = -6.87, p < .001; number of
fixations: Z = -4.24, p < .001; total reading time: Z = -6.80, p < .001)
and controls (first fixation duration: Z = -8.53, p < .001; gaze duration:
Z = -8.54, p < .001; number of fixations: Z = -7.15, p < .001; total reading
time: Z = -12.12, p < .001).
To further explore the effect of repetition on reading times, a gains
analysis was conducted. The general improvement (i.e., overall decrease
in reading times and number of fixations after the eight encounters)
of targets and controls was compared. A gain score was calculated for
each participant for targets and controls, and scores were compared.
Results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests in Table 7 showed that, in the
case of L2 participants, the gain scores were significantly higher for
targets than for controls in three of the four measures examined.
In the case of L1 participants, results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests in
Table 7 showed that, in line with L2 findings, the gain scores were significantly higher for targets than for controls in the four measures examined.
Nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests were also conducted between the
gains experienced by L1 and L2 readers to explore potential differences
between them. Results showed that there were no significant differences

between their gains, both for targets (gains first fixation duration: Z = -.59,
p = .556; gains gaze duration: Z = -.96, p = .337; gains number of fixations:
Z = -1.08, p = .282; gains total reading time: Z = -3.30, p = .741) and for
controls (gains first fixation duration: Z = -.73, p = .464; gains gaze duration: Z = -.33, p = .741; gains number of fixations: Z = -.26, p = .794; gains
total reading time: Z = -.59, p = .556). This suggests that, although L1
readers were generally faster in reading both types of items, both L1 and
L2 readers experienced similar gains in terms of the decrease in reading
times across encounters.
The next interesting question was to find out the point at which the difference between the reading behavior of targets and controls disappeared.
Results have shown that targets showed overall significant longer reading
times when compared to controls and that there is a general decrease in
reading times. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between each of the reading
measures for targets and controls for each encounter showed that, in the
case of L2 participants, although for first fixation duration and gaze duration the difference between targets and controls started to disappear at
around the third and fourth encounter, it was not until the eighth encounter that this difference disappeared in all the measures (see Table 8). This
suggests that, after eight encounters, words that readers had never
encountered started to be read as words they knew very well.
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with the L1 baseline data showed that,
although some differences started to disappear after the second and

third encounters, it was not until the eighth encounter that this difference consistently disappeared in all the measures (see Table 9), suggesting that, as in the case of L2 learners, after eight encounters, previously
unknown words were read as known words.
In response to the second research question, analyses have shown
that reading times for novel target items were initially significantly
longer than for controls. Results also showed that there was an overall pattern of decrease in reading times throughout the eight exposures. The difference between the decrease experienced by control
and target items (both in terms of the number of measures for which
a significant effect was found and the gain analyses) suggests that
this was not simply a practice effect and that, on top of the expected
repetition effect, unknown items experienced an additional decrease
in reading measures. Results have also shown that this effect started
to be significant around the third to fourth encounter and that after
eight encounters previously unknown words started to be read in a
similar manner as known words. Results of these analyses have
shown a very similar pattern for L1 and L2 readers. Interestingly, the
only difference between L1 and L2 readers was not in the magnitude
of the observed effect but in its rate. This significant effect of repetition seemed to start a bit earlier for the L1 readers (i.e., after the first
encounter, but no differences were observed in terms of the overall
gains in reading times).

Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading

Relationship between Offline and Online Measures
Participants' reading behavior on nonwords that had been learned versus those that were not learned (i.e., nonwords for which participants
had provided the correct response versus those for which they had
failed to provide an accurate response in each of the vocabulary tests)
were compared. A mean score for the sum of total reading times on
learned and nonlearned items was calculated per participant. Mean
values for learned versus nonlearned words for all participants were
compared by means of nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results
in Table 8 showed that words for which L2 participants were able to
recall their meaning showed significantly longer total reading times
than words for which participants did not show recall knowledge. There
was no significant relationship between total reading times and the rest
of the lexical aspects. In line with the results for L2 learners, results of
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (Table 10) showed a significant relationship
between total reading times and L1 participants' ability to recall their
meaning. The relationship between the other eye-tracking measures
and vocabulary test scores was also examined, but analyses failed to
show any significant relationship either for L2 or for L1 readers.

In response to the third research question, results of this study indicate that there was a significant relationship between total time spent
reading the target items and participants' ability to recall their meaning,
suggesting that longer reading times on unknown items led to better
learning of the form-meaning link at the recall level. This supports findings of previous studies that have also shown a relationship between
reading times and vocabulary knowledge (e.g., Godfroid et al., 2013;
Williams & Morris, 2004).
Overall, these results showed that reading was an effective means for
acquiring new L2 vocabulary for all participants, not only in terms of the
amount of words learned but also in terms of the speed and fluency of
reading those new words. Results of the comparison of L2 readers'
behavior with the L1 baseline data have also shown that L2 readers seem
to benefit from the reading activity in a similar way to L1 readers.
GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
It has been claimed that studies addressing different components of
vocabulary knowledge have shown more diverse vocabulary learning
than previously thought (e.g., Webb, 2005, 2007a, 2007b). Results of this
study provide further evidence for the advantage of following a multicomponential and multitest approach to vocabulary research to examine the acquisition of different aspects of lexical knowledge. Results of
this study have shown the effectiveness of reading for the incidental
acquisition of several components of vocabulary knowledge (i.e., form
recognition, meaning recognition, and meaning recall), in line with previous studies (e.g., Pellicer-Sanchez & Schmitt, 2010; Waring & Takaki,
2003; Webb, 2005). The L2 and L1 participants in this study learned a
considerable number of the six unknown items after being exposed to
them eight times, with meaning recall being the most difficult aspect to
acquire, followed by the recognition of form and meaning, providing
further evidence that productive aspects of lexical mastery are more
difficult to acquire than recognition aspects (e.g., Brown et al., 2008;
Pellicer-Sanchez & Schmitt, 2010; Rott, 1999; Webb, 2005, 2007a, 2007b).
The present results have also shown that receptive aspects of vocabulary are not only easier to acquire but may also lead to higher degrees
of certainty. The comparison between the L2 and L1 data also showed
that there are no differences in the lexical gains experienced by L1 and
L2 readers. The advanced L2 learners in this study appeared to benefit
from the reading activity in the same way as L1 readers. Results of this
study are indicative of incidental learning in the sense that these lexical
gains occur as a by-product of the activity of reading and without being
explicitly asked to learn that vocabulary. However, as shown by the
online reading behavior, and as argued by Godfroid and colleagues (2013),

Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading

123

this does not mean that participants did not attend to those unknown
items and attempt to infer their meaning.
This study has also examined the online reading of unknown items in
context. L1 and L2 participants initially spent longer time reading the
unknown items. These longer reading times in the initial encounters may
reflect readers' attempts at inferring the meaning (e.g., Bengeleil &
Paribakht, 2004; Fraser, 1999; Godfroid et al., 2013; Paribakht & Wesche,
1999). Present results have shown that, as the number of encounters
increased, reading times and number of fixations for both L1 and L2
readers decreased. For L2 learners, this decrease started to be significant
after three to four encounters and, for L1 readers, the decrease started to
be significant after the first encounter. After eight repetitions, unknown
items started to be read in a similar way as known words by both L1 and
L2 participants. These patterns of reading behavior suggest that by three
to four encounters L2 readers might have already integrated lexical and
semantic information and attached a meaning to the unknown items. As
Paribakht and Wesche (1999) claimed, the intake and subsequent integration of new vocabulary knowledge normally requires repeated input processing during multiple encounters. The results of the study reported in
this article suggest that this integration of lexical and semantic information may happen earlier for L1 readers than for L2 learners. Wesche,
Paribakht, and Haastrup (2010) claimed that during repeated exposures
to new vocabulary, learners develop a more detailed mental representation of those words as well as increasingly fluent access to it. In the present study, this increased fluent access and a consolidation of that lexical
knowledge might have been achieved by the eighth encounter and
reflected in the similarity between the reading of targets and controls. This would suggest that the optimal figure for achieving a more
fluent reading behavior is around eight encounters, in line with what
previous studies examining other components of vocabulary knowledge have shown (e.g. Horst et al., 1998).
The patterns of reading found in the study reported in this article could
also be interpreted by the five-step model of vocabulary learning proposed by Brown and Payne (1994; in Hatch & Brown, 1995). This model
suggests that after encountering a new word (first stage), learners get a
clear visual image of the word (second stage) and then connect that form
with the meaning (third stage) and consolidate this form-meaning link
(fourth stage) until they can use those learned words (fifth stage). L2
participants in this study may have reached the third stage by the third
to fourth encounter, whereas L1 readers may have already reached it by
the second encounter. The fourth stage of consolidation may have been
reached by both L1 and L2 readers by the eighth encounter.
However, it is important to note that the preceding interpretation only
accounts for the reading behavior of words for which participants created some sort of form-meaning link, and it is therefore only a prediction

124

Ana Pellicer-Sanchez

of what the observed reading behavior may reflect. Alternative interpretations need to account for the decrease in reading times for words for
which a form-meaning link was not successfully created. In line with
Hyona and Niemi's (1990) interpretation, the decreased reading times
in this study can also be explained as an effect of increased familiarity
of the visuographic features of nonwords. Participants' increased familiarity with the nonwords after the first encounter is reflected in a
decrease in reading times, either with or without successful creation
of a form-meaning link. This increased familiarity with the visuographic
features of words could also explain the decrease experienced by
control items.
The present study has also shown a relationship between longer
reading times and participants' ability to recall the meaning of words,
supporting results of previous studies (e.g., Godfroid et al., 2013;
Godfroid & Schmidtke, 2013). The important role that attention plays in
language learning has been stressed by many researchers (e.g., Schmidt,
1995). Alanen (1995) found that increased attention to target items
seemed to be related to the acquisition of some aspects of those
items regardless of the treatment received. Longer reading times may
suggest increased attention, potentially explaining the connection
between longer reading times and better recall scores. However, what
the results of the study presented in this article strictly show is a link
between reading times and vocabulary scores.
Regarding the comparison of L1 and L2 results, this study has shown
that advanced L2 readers seem to benefit from the reading activity in
a very similar way to L1 readers, both in terms of the lexical knowledge shown in the postreading tests and in terms of the online reading
patterns. L1 and L2 readers seem to achieve the same ultimate improvement in reading times. The only difference seems to be in the rate of
that improvement, with the effect of repetition happening earlier for
L1 readers than for L2 learners. The similarity of these patterns is
probably due to the high level of proficiency of the L2 learners in this
study. Future studies should examine the behavior of learners of lower
proficiency to investigate whether the patterns observed here also extend
to other groups of L2 learners.
The results of this study have important pedagogical implications.
Results have shown the important effect of frequency of exposure, reinforcing the need to provide learners with enough exposures to the
target vocabulary. In addition, if longer reading times lead to better
learning, teachers may need to use different techniques to increase the
saliency of target vocabulary in reading texts and to drive learners'
attention to the target vocabulary, increasing the time spent in reading
target vocabulary. This is in line with studies suggesting that drawing
learners' attention to words, for instance by highlighting words in the
text (e.g., with color, bold, italics), could improve vocabulary gains

Incidental Vocabulary Acquisition from Reading

125

(e.g., Laufer & Hill, 2000). Winke (2013) investigated the effect of textual
enhancement on grammar learning using eye-tracking and found that
enhancement led to increased reading times but that it did not have any
effect on learning. Further research should examine whether similar
patterns are found for lexical learning.
One limitation of the present study is the use of invented items, which
replaced high-frequency words as opposed to low-frequency real words.
Although this ensured no previous knowledge of the target vocabulary,
it could be argued that this may not represent a natural context of L2
reading and guessing from context. The reading materials of this study
were not representative of the reading situations in which L2 learners
acquire a new concept or a L2 word for a L1 concept for which they do
not have a L2 word yet. However, they are representative of many other
L2 reading situations in which learners learn a new label for a concept
for which they already have another L2 word and create the formmeaning connection (e.g., when encountering archaic words, specialized vocabulary, or dialectal words in a text). In addition, all target
items in this study were concrete nouns, which have been found to be
easier to learn than other parts of speech (Macaro, 2003). Future studies
that use eye-tracking to explore learning from reading should examine
the acquisition of other parts of speech. It is also important to note that
the situation in this study is an ideal reading situation: All words in the
text are known except for six, relatively short words, which are repeated
eight times each in a short time span and which have the same meaning
in each of the encounters. Future research should examine other more
complex reading situations.
Another important limitation of the present study is the diverse L1
background of the participants. The possible influences of different
language backgrounds, L1 writing systems, and L1 reading skills on the
processes investigated in this study should be examined in future studies.
Overall, this study has shown the advantages of using a variety of
online and offline measures for researching vocabulary acquisition from
reading. Results of this study have expanded our knowledge and understanding of the quantity and quality of vocabulary knowledge that can
be learned from reading, providing a fuller account of incidental vocabulary learning not only from reading but also while reading.

3. The limited reliability of the self-assessment measure needs to be acknowledged.
Time constraints did not allow the use of a more direct measure of proficiency. In this
study, this limitation is overcome by the other indicators of advanced level of proficiency (i.e., level of studies, the similar context of use of English, and pre-university
requirements).
4. The assessment of comprehension was not the focus of the study and was only
used to ensure participants' careful reading and to examine reading in the context of general comprehension. The true-false measure was thus considered a sufficient measure of
general comprehension.
5. The number of outliers found on control words and on target words was very similar for both L2 and L1 participants (L2 participants: 45% of outliers on control words and
55% on target words; L1 participants: 48% of outliers on control words and 51% on target
words).
