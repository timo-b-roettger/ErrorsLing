The Relationship Between Phonological
Memory, Receptive Vocabulary,
and Fast Mapping in Young Children
With Specific Language Impairment
Shelley Gray
Arizona State University, Tempe

Purpose: This study assessed the fast mapping performance of children with specific
language impairment (SLI) across the preschool to kindergarten age span in relation to
their phonological memory and vocabulary development.
Method: Fifty-three children diagnosed with SLI and 53 children with normal
language (NL) matched for age and gender (30 three-year-olds, 18 four-year-olds,
28 five-year-olds, and 30 six-year-olds) participated. Children's phonological memory
was assessed using nonword repetition and digit span tasks. Receptive vocabulary
was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test -- III. Children learned the
names for 8 objects during 2 fast mapping tasks.
Results: Overall, the NL group demonstrated significantly better performance on
phonological memory and vocabulary measures across the age span; however,
performance on the fast mapping task differed significantly only at age 5. Phonological
memory and existing receptive vocabulary did not predict fast mapping ability.
Conclusions: The phonological memory skills of preschoolers with NL and SLI followed a
similar developmental pattern, but the SLI group consistently scored significantly lower
than the NL group. Overall, the NL group showed significantly better receptive
vocabulary, with evidence that between-group differences increased at age 6. Neither
short-term phonological memory nor receptive vocabulary predicted fast mapping
comprehension or production performance, even though both have been shown to
correlate with later stages of word learning.

pproximately 7% of children in the United States are diagnosed
with specific language impairment (SLI). In addition to problems
acquiring morphology and syntax, a significant number of children also demonstrate difficulty acquiring vocabulary (Paul, 1996; Rescorla,
Roberts, & Dahlsgaard, 1997; Watkins, Kelly, Harbers, & Hollis, 1995).
Vocabulary deficits are particularly devastating in young children because lexical acquisition is strongly associated with language and literacy development.
Researchers are working to understand the deficits that contribute
to poor lexical acquisition by examining the word learning process. To
comprehend new words, children must segment them from utterances and
store sufficient phonological, semantic, syntactic, and nonverbal information to recall them and to elaborate their representations over time. To
produce words stored representations must be strong enough to permit
consistent retrieval and output of their phonological forms.

Fast mapping (Carey & Bartlett, 1978) is the initial
step in this word learning process that occurs when a
child encounters a word for the first time, creates an
initial phonological representation of the word, forms hypotheses about its meaning, and creates a phonological-
semantic link between these representations. Normally
developing children as young as 2 years old are able to
fast map, and this ability is thought to contribute importantly to the rapid acceleration in word learning beginning at about 18 months of age (e.g., Golinkoff,
Hirsh-Pasek, Bailey, & Wenger, 1992; Markman, 1989).
Research suggests that word learning success may
depend, in part, on fast mapping success. Gray (2003b)
found that the fast mapping comprehension and production performance of 4- and 5-year-old children with SLI
and age- and gender-matched children with normal
language (NL) was a significant predictor of the number
of words children later learned to comprehend and to
produce during a word learning task. On the 1st day of
that study, the fast mapping task assessed children's
learning of four new words presented six times. On Days
2-5, the word learning task assessed learning of the same
four words as they were explicitly taught in a supported
learning context. Fast mapping comprehension performance predicted 15% of the variance for word learning
comprehension for the SLI group and 18% of the variance
for the NL group. Fast mapping production accounted for
22% of the variance associated with the number of words
children in the SLI group later learned to produce, with
fast mapping comprehension accounting for 19% of the
variance associated with the number of words children in
the NL group later learned to produce. In a different study,
Gray (2004) also found that fast mapping comprehension
(R2 = .11) was a significant predictor of word learning comprehension and fast mapping production (R2 = .17) was a
significant predictor of word learning production for preschoolers with SLI and age-matched peers with NL.
Given the relationship between fast mapping and
word learning and the lexical acquisition difficulties of
children with SLI, it is important to determine whether
the fast mapping skills of children with SLI are poorer
than those of children with NL and, if so, to identify
underlying deficits that may contribute to this problem.
Several studies have investigated these issues.
Experimental results show that compared to children
with NL, children with SLI often evidence fast mapping
difficulty; however, performance varies depending on the
number and type of words presented, the number of
models provided, and how learning is assessed. In some
cases, SLI group performance appears comparable to
NL group performance, and in others, primarily when
production is measured, the SLI group shows a deficit.
In one of the first fast mapping experiments that
included children with LI, Dollaghan (1987) measured

956

preschool children's comprehension and production of one
novel word presented once or twice in a single session.
She found that children with LI comprehended the words
as well as age-matched peers with NL but produced fewer
of the word's phonemes than children with NL.
Rice and colleagues (Rice, Buhr, & Nemeth, 1990;
Rice, Buhr, & Oetting, 1992; Rice, Oetting, Marquis,
Bode, & Pae, 1994) introduced a methodological variation
on previous fast mapping tasks that they termed quick
incidental learning (QUIL). In their QUIL studies, children received 3-10 exposures for 8-20 new words (nouns,
verbs, and adjectives) as they watched videotapes; but
unlike typical fast mapping studies, they received no
prompting from adults to attend to the new words. The
comprehension performance of preschool children with
SLI was compared with that of two control groups with
NL, one age matched and one language matched. When
provided with few exposures to new words, the SLI group
responded correctly to fewer comprehension probes than
an age-matched NL group. They performed as well as the
NL group when they received more exposures to the words.
Rice et al. (1990, 1992, 1994) examined the relationship
between performance on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test-Revised (PPVT-R; Dunn & Dunn, 1981) and performance on the QUIL tasks. No statistically significant
correlations were observed. Children with SLI in this series of studies, however, were selected in part because of
their low vocabulary scores. Therefore, the lack of correlation could reflect the restricted range of vocabulary
scores in their sample.
Eyer et al. (2002) examined fast mapping comprehension of four new verbs by 8 children with SLI ages 42-
66 months. In this experiment, children with SLI were
language matched to younger, normally developing children. Children heard each word a total of four times across
experimental sessions. No between-group differences were
found. In a second experiment, 8 different preschool-age
children with SLI were matched to peers with NL by age
and to a second, younger language-matched group. They
were presented four new nouns and four new verbs with
four exposures each. Again, no significant between-group
differences were found; however, all three groups demonstrated higher accuracy for nouns than verbs.
Gray (2003b) assessed the fast mapping performance
of thirty 4- and 5-year-old children with SLI matched by
age and gender to 30 children with NL. They received
three exposures each to four new nouns. The groups did
not differ significantly for comprehension or production,
with both groups making significantly more correct responses to comprehension than production probes. No
significant correlation was found between scores on any
of the speech or language tests administered (e.g.,
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test -- III [PPVT-III];
Dunn & Dunn, 1997) or the Bankson-Bernthal Test

of Phonology (BBTOP; Bankson & Bernthal, 1990) and
the number of correct responses to comprehension or
production probes on the fast mapping task.
In a similar study, Gray (2004) compared the fast
mapping performance of twenty 4- and 5-year-olds with
SLI with 20 age- and gender-matched children with NL.
Children received three exposures to four new nouns. The
NL group produced significantly more correct responses
to comprehension probes than the SLI group, but significant between-group differences were not found for production. As in the previous study, both groups responded
correctly to more comprehension than production probes.
PPVT-III (R2 = .26) and BBTOP (R2 = .11) scores were
significant predictors of fast mapping comprehension,
and PPVT-III (R2 = .21) and Kaufman Assessment
Battery for Children (K-ABC) Nonverbal scale scores
(Kaufman & Kaufman, 1983; R2 = .10) were significant
predictors of production.
Alt, Plante, and Creusere (2004) compared the performance of preschoolers with SLI and NL in a task
designed to measure fast mapping of semantic attributes
for both verbs and nouns. The SLI group recognized fewer
semantic features of objects and actions than their peers
with NL and also recognized fewer names during a comprehension task. This was true whether children had
achieved high or low scores on the PPVT-III. The authors
found significant correlations between performance on the
PPVT-III and name recognition for the SLI group for both
nouns (r = .53) and verbs (r = .56); however, the correlation
was significant only for nouns (r = .43) for the NL group.
Despite their different methodologies, these studies
suggest that during fast mapping tasks, preschoolers
with SLI often establish strong enough phonological and
semantic representations of words, and strong enough
links between those representations, to permit them to
choose the word's referent from an array of pictures or
objects, with the caveat that they do better when fewer
words are presented and when they receive more exposures to the words. Fewer studies have examined production, and these report mixed results, suggesting the
need for more systematic investigation. In addition, preschoolers have generally been studied as one age group;
therefore, we have little information regarding the fast
mapping development of children with SLI during the
preschool-to-kindergarten age span.
Why might young children with SLI fast map less
efficiently than their peers with NL, and why might they
have particular difficulty with production? One candidate problem is reduced short-term phonological memory
capacity. According to Gathercole and Baddeley (1990),
the phonological loop component of short-term memory
provides temporary storage of unfamiliar phonological
forms while more permanent memory representations
are being constructed. Children who cannot create stable
phonological representations of words cannot elaborate

them with additional exposures because the new word
may not be recognized or recalled. Because children with
SLI show consistently poorer performance than their NL
peers on phonological memory tasks (Bishop, North, &
Donlan, 1996; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Edwards
& Lahey, 1998; Ellis Weismer et al., 2000; Gathercole
& Baddeley, 1990; Gray, 2003a; Gray, Plante, Vance, &
Henrichsen, 1999), limited phonological memory capacity
may be implicated as an underlying factor for poor fast
mapping ability.
A related candidate problem is a poorly developed
lexicon. Although fast mapping studies to date are equivocal with regard to a significant relationship between extant vocabulary and fast mapping success, a number of
studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between
performance on phonological memory tasks and existing
vocabulary (Gathercole, 1995; Gathercole, Hitch, Service,
& Martin, 1997). For example, Gathercole, Hitch, Adams,
and Martin (1999) found that a composite receptive, expressive, and word knowledge vocabulary score was significantly correlated with nonword repetition and digit
span scores in normally developing 5-year-olds. Edwards,
Beckman, and Munson (2004) studied typically developing
children ages 3;2 [ years;months] to 8;10 and found that
children with larger vocabularies were more accurate at
repeating nonwords than children with smaller vocabularies, whether they were tested using nonwords with
high- or low-frequency phoneme sequences. Their results
provide support for the proposal that children with smaller
vocabularies may have more difficulty forming production
routines for new words because they do not have as many
stored sublexical patterns from which to draw. That is,
when they encounter a new word, it is less likely that they
can abstract knowledge about the acoustic patterns and
the articulation of the new word from previously stored
words, making it less likely that successful production will
result. Further research investigating the relationship
between receptive vocabulary and fast mapping would
help to determine whether the association between vocabulary and word learning begins at the early stage of fast
mapping and whether extant vocabulary differentially
affects comprehension or production.
Limited phonological memory might also explain
why a child with SLI could have difficulty with fast mapping production even if she or he comprehends a new
word. Correct responses to comprehension probes during
fast mapping tasks provides evidence that a phonological
representation and phonological-semantic link are sufficiently established for a child to choose a correct referent
when the phonology is provided; however, this level of
representation may not be sufficiently robust for the child
to successfully produce the word when its phonology must
be retrieved and output without the benefit of phonological cuing. If children with SLI have reduced phonological
memory, they would require more exposures to a word

than children with NL to store a strong enough phonological representation to produce the word.
Interestingly, this same difficulty with phonological
representation may affect the child's ability to store and
to retrieve semantic representations of the word. Storkel's
(2001, 2003) research suggests that phonological regularities influence the creation of semantic representations
and the associations between phonological and semantic
representations. Thus, children who have difficulty forming phonological representations of words might also be
expected to have difficulty forming underlying semantic
representations (Storkel & Morrisette, 2002).
If children with SLI do demonstrate poorer fast mapping ability than their peers with NL and this is strongly
related to phonological memory capacity or to their existing
lexicon, we would expect to see an ongoing relationship
between measures of phonological memory, extant vocabulary, and fast mapping performance beginning by age 3
and continuing into elementary school. To assess this relationship, it would be important to understand the developmental course of fast mapping. Although there is
limited research in this area, it appears that in children
with NL, fast mapping ability improves with age, as does
performance on phonological memory tasks and vocabulary size. In one longitudinal study, Mervis and Bertrand
(1994) found that the appearance of fast mapping ability in
young children with NL co-occurred with an increased
ability to rapidly learn new words. They also found that
existing vocabulary size was more closely associated with
fast mapping ability than chronological age. Wilkinson,
Ross, and Diamond (2003) compared the fast mapping
skills of 58 preschoolers with NL in two age groups, those
under 42 months of age and those over 42 months of age.
They found that older children quickly mapped a second
novel word better than younger children, regardless of the
training procedure used.
The purposes of this study were to develop a more
comprehensive picture of children's fast mapping ability
across the preschool-to-kindergarten age range and to assess whether the developmental course of fast mapping for
children with SLI and NL is related to phonological memory and receptive vocabulary development. The series of
cross-sectional studies included 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-year old
children with SLI matched by age and gender to peers with
NL.
Nonword repetition and digit span were selected to
assess children's short-term phonological memory. Nonword repetition tasks require a child to listen to a series
of nonsense words of varied lengths and to repeat them
correctly. Digit span tasks require a child to listen to a list
of single-digit numbers presented in series of increasing
lengths and to repeat them in the correct sequence. There
is some suggestion that nonword repetition provides a
purer measure of short-term phonological memory than

958

digit span (Gathercole et al., 1997) because, unlike with
the familiar numbers used for digit span, the child cannot
use prior lexical knowledge to complete the task. Several
researchers have demonstrated, however, that nonword
repetition performance is related to both phonological
memory and to accumulated lexical knowledge in that
the more wordlike the nonwords, the easier they are to
repeat (Dollaghan, Biber & Campbell, 1995; Gathercole
& Baddeley, 1990). Therefore, both nonword repetition
and digit span were included in this study to provide a
comprehensive assessment of phonological memory.
The specific research questions were (a) Do the NL
and SLI groups differ significantly on phonological memory measures, receptive vocabulary, or fast mapping comprehension or production at 3, 4, 5, or 6 years of age? (b) Is
performance on phonological memory tasks or existing
receptive vocabulary significantly correlated with fast mapping comprehension or production at 3, 4, 5, or 6 years
of age? (c) Does performance on phonological memory
tasks or a receptive vocabulary test predict a significant
amount of variance associated with fast mapping comprehension or production at 3, 4, 5, or 6 years of age?

Method
Participants
Fifty-three children diagnosed with SLI and 53
children with NL participated in the study. Each child
with NL was selected to match a child with SLI for gender
and age (3 months) so that both language groups included
15 three-year-olds, 9 four-year-olds, 14 five-year-olds, and
15 six-year-olds. All children spoke Standard American
English as their primary language. Portions of the data for
the 4- and 5-year-old children were reported in Gray (2004).
Table 1 provides descriptive information about both
groups. Of the 53 children in the NL group who reported
race, 1 was African American, 3 were Asian, 11 were
Hispanic, 4 were Native American, 29 were White, and 1
reported "Other." In the SLI group, 1 was African American, 2 were Asian, 15 were Hispanic, 29 were White, and
6 reported "Other."
To qualify for inclusion, children with SLI were
required to be enrolled in language therapy. In Arizona,
children must score more than 1.5 standard deviations
below the mean on two norm-referenced language tests
to receive therapy services. Certified speech-language
pathologists administered additional speech and language
tests to further describe the children. Table 1 provides the
mean group scores on these measures.
Children were recruited from public school, clinic,
and child care programs. A certified speech-language
pathologist determined that each child met the following
selection criteria:

files by an adult female speaker using a headset microphone and were subsequently equated for playback loudness using Goldwave audio software. The 16 nonwords,
from one to four syllables long, were presented to children
via computer over headphones with repetitions recorded
via a headset microphone into WAV computer files or onto
audiotape. Before presentation, a female voice on the computer said, "Hello there, welcome to the word game. I'm
going to say a funny, made-up word. I want you to say
it just like me. Are you ready? Say ___." The research
assistant (RA) advanced the computer to the next nonword
after the child completed their repetition. RAs scored each
nonword live as children repeated them. If the child repeated the nonword exactly, 1 point was credited. This scoring differed from that used by Dollaghan and Campbell, in
that they used percentage phonemes correct scoring. RAs
subsequently listened to the recorded responses and rescored, as correct, any nonword where an error was due to a
consistent phoneme substitution (e.g., /k / for /g/) that was
also present on the BBTOP (Bankson & Bernthal, 1990).
A second RA scored three samples selected at random from
each language group at each age for a total of 24 samples. Point-to-point agreement between the two coders for
scoring of each nonword was 93% (range = 87%-100%).
A digit span task also assessed phonological memory.
Numbers from 1 to 9 were randomly selected without replacement to form lists varying from three to nine numbers in length. The lists were recorded as WAV computer
files by an adult female speaker using a headset microphone with approximately 1 s between each digit. The
WAV files were subsequently equated for playback loudness using Goldwave audio software. Presentation was via
computer using headphones. Two lists were presented at
each length, beginning with three digits. Children's repetitions were recorded via a headset microphone into WAV
computer files or onto audiotape. Before presentation, the
same female voice on the computer said, "Hello there, welcome to the numbers game. I'm going to say some numbers,
then you say them right after me. Are you ready? Say ___."
The RA advanced the computer to the next span after the
children finished repeating a span. RAs scored each repetition live. If a child repeated each number in the series in
the correct order, they were credited with 1 point. The task
continued until the child failed to repeat either series of
numbers at the same span length. A second RA scored
three samples selected randomly from each language
group at each age. Point-to-point agreement between the
two coders for awarding a point to each correctly repeated
sequence was 96% (range = 88%-100%).

to name a variety of candidate objects. Objects they
did not name consistently were categorized as "unfamiliar," and objects that evoked the same name from each
adult were categorized as "familiar." Objects thus classified were selected for further evaluation. Next, these
objects were shown to six 5-year-old children with NL
who were not a part of this study. Four objects that
evoked the same name from each child ( henceforth referred to as familiar) and four that were never correctly
named nor evoked the same name from any child (henceforth referred to as unfamiliar) were selected for use as
target objects.
The eight selected objects were divided into two separate sets (A, B) described in Table 2. Each set contained
two familiar and two unfamiliar objects. The objectselection process described above resulted in selection of
objects representing both animate and inanimate kinds
of natural categories (Clark & Clark, 1977). Both types
were included in the study because children must fast
map names for both familiar and unfamiliar objects. To
balance the object sets, one familiar object in each set
represented a living, animate object (turtle or butterfly)
and one a living, inanimate object (cactus or tree). The
remaining objects in each set were inanimate and made
from organic or inorganic materials (e.g., wood, metal).
Additional common objects that children could already
name were also included (e.g., box, table) to increase children's naming success and the likelihood that they would
attempt to name all objects.
Target words. Eight target words were chosen from
a list of two-syllable, CVCVC English words typically
pronounced with stress on the first syllable. Because of
their low incidence in spoken English (Hall, Nagy, &
Linn, 1984), the words were assumed to be unfamiliar
to preschool children. The eight words were divided into
two separate sets (A, B) described in Table 2. Each set
contained two phonologically simple words (e.g., included
only nasal and stop consonants) and two phonologically
complex words (e.g., included primarily fricatives and affricates consonants; cf. Willerman & Lindblom, 1991).
The word sets were balanced by occurrence of consonant
type (stops, fricatives, and affricates). Each child had the
opportunity to fast map both sets of words. Word set order
was counterbalanced across groups.

Procedures
The fast mapping task was part of a larger word
learning study. As illustrated in the Appendix, fast mapping required two sessions out of approximately 19 days
that children were engaged in research. Each fast mapping session lasted approximately 30 min. Children worked
with the same RA in a quiet room at their preschool. RAs,
who were undergraduate students in speech and hearing
science, demonstrated standardized presentation and scoring of the fast mapping task before study initiation.
Children completed assessments and the nonword
repetition and digit span tasks during the first 3 days of
the study. Test and task administration was counterbalanced across children in each group. On the next study
day, they completed the fast mapping task for Word Set A
or B (counterbalanced across children). Approximately
10 days later, they completed the fast mapping task for
the remaining word set.
The fast mapping task proceeded in three phases.
During the first phase, the RA pulled target and common
objects from a bag in random order and modeled each
name as the objects were presented to the child (e.g.,
"This is the [target word]"). Next, the RA administered a
comprehension probe for each of the target and common
objects (e.g., "Hand me the [target word]") in random order. All eight objects were on the table during comprehension probes. Finally, the RA administered a production
probe for each object (e.g., "What's this?" or "What are
you holding?"). The procedures for the second and third
phases were identical to the first, except that the objects
were already on the table and the production probes for
the third phase were administered by asking the child
to name each object as it was returned to the bag. Each
correct response scored 1 point. No feedback regarding
accuracy of response was provided. By the end of the session, the names for target and common objects had been
modeled three times, and three comprehension and three
production probes were administered. Because the comprehension probes required the RA to say the name of
each object, the child actually heard each name spoken
six times. Because children knew the names for the common objects present during comprehension probes, the
probability of identifying the correct target object by chance
was 3 or .25 for each probe. Comprehension performance
was significantly above chance--one-sample t test compared with 25%, t(106) = -44.29, p < .0001.
To assess procedural reliability, a second RA attended
or reviewed videotapes of 20% of the experimental sessions
and evaluated the first RA's delivery of the instructional
procedures. The first and second RAs' written experimental protocols were then compared for point-to-point agreement. The average agreement for procedural reliability
was 98% (range = 94%-100%). The second RA also assessed scoring reliability by recording the child's responses

on a written protocol. The first and second RAs' written
experimental protocols were then compared. Point-topoint scoring agreement was 97% (range = 84%-100%).

Results
Phonological Memory Measures
and Receptive Vocabulary
Mean standard scores for the PPVT-III are reported
in Table 1. Mean scores for the number of nonwords repeated correctly on the NWRT and the number of spans
repeated correctly on the digit span task are reported in
Table 3. A multivariate analysis of variance was completed to compare performance between the NL and SLI
groups by age on the NWRT, digit span task, and the
PPVT-III. Results (Pillai's trace) revealed a significant
multivariate group effect, F(3, 96) = 19.48, p < .0001,
h2 = .429. For the NWRT, examination of univariate Fs
indicated significant effects for group, F(1, 7) = 29.39,
p < .0001, h2 = .583, and age, F(3, 7) = 75.62, p = .0003,
h2 = .407. There was no significant Group x Age interaction. Tukey post hoc comparisons indicated that the NL
group scored significantly higher than the SLI group at
each age and that 3-year-olds scored significantly lower
than the 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds, who did not differ.
Univariate analyses for digit span also indicated a
significant effect for group, F(1, 7) = 23.94, p < .0001,
h2 = .329, and for age, F(3, 7) = 15.96, p < .0001, h2 = .658,
with no Group x Age interaction. As with the NWRT,

the NL group scored significantly higher than the SLI
group at each age, and 3-year-olds scored significantly
lower than the 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds, who did not differ.
Univariate analyses for the PPVT-III indicated a

group scored significantly higher than the SLI group at
ages 3, 4, and 6 years, but the between-group difference
for 5-year-olds was not significant, resulting in the significant Group x Age interaction.

Fast Mapping
Means and standard deviations for fast mapping
comprehension and production are reported in Table 4.

Nonparametric statistics were used to analyze fast mapping performance because data were not normally distributed. Younger children's scores for fast mapping production
were very low. The number of correct responses to comprehension and production probes was analyzed using separate Mann-Whitney U tests corrected for tied ranks to
yield a Z score. The alpha level was set at .05 (two-tailed)
for each comparison. Results were first analyzed for group
differences by age.
Figure 4 shows box-and-whisker plots for fast mapping comprehension based on median values for each measure. The lower and upper limits of each box, respectively,
represent the first and third quartiles of the data. The
whiskers represent the range of the data. For comprehension, between-group differences (NL, SLI) were significant
only for 5-year-olds (z = 2.04, p = .0414, rs = -.40). Those
for 3-year-olds (z = -0.56, p = .5733, rs = .11), 4-year-olds
( z = -0.27, p = .7889, rs = .07), and 6-year-olds ( z = 0.19,
p = .8505, rs = -.04) were not. As illustrated in Figure 4,
one 4-year-old from the SLI group was an outlier, responding correctly to 22 comprehension probes. Statistical
analyses were reconducted without this participant, but
between-group results for 4-year-olds did not change.
Figure 5 shows box-and-whisker plots for fast
mapping production based on median values for each
measure. Results were similar to comprehension, with
significant between-group differences found for 5-yearolds (z = 2.51, p = .0121, rs = -.49) but not for 3-year-olds
(z = 1.31, p = .1091, rs = -.25), 4-year-olds (z = 0.00, p = 1.00,
rs = .01), or 6-year-olds (z = 0.75, p = .4544, rs = -.14).
Analyses of between-group differences for age using
Friedman's chi-square indicated that there was a significant age effect for comprehension for the NL group,
Q(3) = 17.1266, p = .0007, rs = .39, but not for the SLI

indicated that for the NL group, 5- and 6-year-olds scored
significantly higher than 3- or 4-year olds, but no
between-group differences were found for the two youngest or two oldest age groups.
Like comprehension, analyses for production indicated that there was a significant effect for age for the NL
group, Q(3) = 9.3744, p = .0247, rs = .23, but not for the SLI
group, Q(3) = 1.3134, p = .7260, rs = .23. Post hoc testing

Discussion
Because lexical acquisition is such an important part
of oral language and literacy development, it is important
to identify factors that contribute to the word learning
difficulty experienced by children with SLI. Fast mapping
ability would be expected to impact lexical acquisition
because it represents the initial step in the word learning process. Deficits in short-term phonological memory
or existing vocabulary have been proposed as possible underlying causes related to poor word learning by children
with SLI, but this has not been investigated in relation
to fast mapping. The purpose of this study was to compare the fast mapping, phonological memory, and receptive vocabulary performance of young children with SLI
and NL at four different ages to assess the relationship
among these skills across the preschool-to-kindergarten
age span.
NL and SLI groups demonstrated similar developmental patterns for phonological memory task performance,
with a significant increase in scores between ages 3 and 4
on both the NWRT and the digit span task. Scores
remained relatively stable for 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds.
These results are similar to those of Gathercole, Willis,

Emslie, and Baddeley (1992), who reported an increase in
NWRT scores between 4 and 5 years of age but little
difference between 5- and 6-year-old normally-developing
children. Although the developmental pattern of our NL
and SLI groups was similar, the NL group scored significantly higher than the SLI group on phonological memory measures at each age. Thus, the SLI group showed no
sign of closing the gap as they got older. Indeed, other
studies have shown that this phonological memory performance gap persists into the school years (Dollaghan &
Campbell, 1998; Ellis Weismer et al., 2000).
Because standard scores based on age norms were
used for the PPVT-III, an age effect would not be expected; however, the pattern of scores showed the largest
between-group difference (26 points) at age 6. McGregor,
Newman, Reilly, and Capone (2002) recently reported a
similar 22-point difference for 6-year-olds with NL and
SLI.
In contrast to performance on the phonological
memory tasks and receptive vocabulary, between-group
differences for fast-mapping comprehension and production were found only at age 5. There also appeared to be a
different developmental pattern for the NL and SLI
groups in that fast mapping scores for both comprehension and production in the NL group were higher for 5and 6-year-olds than younger children, but no significant
increase was observed for the SLI group. Further, there
appeared to be a different developmental pattern in phonological memory and fast mapping scores. A significant
increase in phonological memory occurred between ages 3
and 4 for both groups, but an increase in fast mapping
occurred between ages 4 and 5 and then only for the NL
group.
These differences were underscored by findings showing that age, test, and task performance failed to predict a
significant amount of variance for fast mapping comprehension or production for the SLI group. Age was the only
significant predictor of comprehension for the NL group.
Nonword repetition was the only significant predictor for
fast mapping production for the NL group and it accounted
for a small amount of variance. This suggests that although short term phonological memory and existing lexical knowledge may contribute importantly to the formation of stable phonological and semantic representations
of words over time, they did not significantly affect fast
mapping success under these experimental conditions.
The lack of a relationship between receptive vocabulary and fast mapping has also been found in other fast
mapping studies. For example, Rice et al. (1990, 1992,
1994) found no correlation between QUIL scores and
PPVT-R scores, although children were selected based
on low vocabulary; therefore, a limited range of scores
may have reduced the probability of a significant correlation. Gray (2003b) also found no significant correlation

966

between fast mapping comprehension or production
and PPVT-III scores for NL or SLI groups. Conversely,
two previous fast mapping studies reported significant
correlations between receptive vocabulary and fast mapping performance. Gray (2004) found that PPVT-III
scores predicted 26% of the variance associated with fast
mapping comprehension and 21% of the variance associated with fast mapping production. In this study, however, the NL and SLI groups were not separated in the
regression analyses, raising the possibility that scores
from the NL group influenced the overall relationship.
Alt et al. (2004) found significant correlations between
performance on the PPVT-III and name recognition
(comprehension) for the SLI group for both nouns and
verbs and for nouns for the NL group. Because this study
emphasized the mapping of semantic attributes and because vocabulary tests necessarily assess semantic knowledge of words, a stronger relationship between existing
vocabulary and fast mapping might be expected in this
type of fast mapping task.
What might explain the between-group differences
for fast mapping comprehension and production at age 5?
An examination of the assessment data reveals only one
notable difference. This group of 5-year-olds also had the
lowest mean SPELT-II scores, although SPELT-II scores
were not significant predictors of fast mapping performance. Inasmuch as the SPELT-II serves as an index of
language impairment with its assessment of grammatical
morphology, it is possible that this sample of 5-year-olds
was more severe than children in the other samples and
that this indirectly affected fast mapping performance.
Given the consistent finding that SLI groups learn
fewer words than their peers with NL in more extended
word learning studies (e.g., Gray, 2003b, 2004; Kiernan &
Gray, 1998) and that children with SLI in this study
clearly had poorer phonological memory skills and
receptive vocabulary than their peers with NL, why did
the 3-, 4- and 6-year old SLI groups perform comparably
to the NL groups? One probable reason is the procedure
used for the fast mapping task. Rice et al. (1994) found
that increasing the number of exposures to a word
permitted the SLI group to perform as well as the NL
group, and in this study, children heard each target word
six times, which is more exposures than in typical fast
mapping tasks but less than in typical QUIL tasks. The
number of words presented would also be expected to
influence success, with more words requiring more processing capacity. Previous studies by Gray (2003b, 2004)
and Eyer et al. (2002) that also presented four new words
tended to result in similar performance between NL and
SLI groups.
An important consideration is the effect that word
and referent choices might have on fast mapping success.
The present study used two-syllable English words that

were not controlled for phonotactic probability. Storkel
(2001, 2003) has shown that normally developing children learn nonwords composed of common sounds sequences more rapidly than nonwords composed of rare
sound sequences. Although this has not been investigated
in young children with SLI, there is the possibility that
word choices might differentially affect these two groups.
Likewise, object choices may influence fast mapping success. The objects that children learned to name in this
study included both familiar and unfamiliar objects,
mirroring the task they face in real life. For example, not
only must they learn a name such as clasp when they
encounter this object for the first time, but they must also
learn dalmation as a name for a particular type of dog.
This second example may prove more challenging when
the child attempts to retrieve the new name dalmation
that competes for retrieval with the older, more established name dog. Because children with SLI often have a
smaller lexicon, there may be a differential effect for
object familiarity for NL and SLI groups, although this
has not been studied experimentally.
In summary, it appears that the phonological memory development of preschoolers with NL and SLI follows
a similar developmental pattern from age 3 to 6, but SLI
group performance is consistently poorer than that of
the NL group. Overall, the SLI group also shows lower
receptive vocabulary as measured by the PPVT-III. Neither short-term phonological memory nor receptive vocabulary appear to predict fast mapping comprehension
or production for children with SLI from ages 3 to 6.
