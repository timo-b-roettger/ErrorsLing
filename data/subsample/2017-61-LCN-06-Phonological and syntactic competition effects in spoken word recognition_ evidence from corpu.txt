ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

As spoken language unfolds over time the speech input transiently activates multiple candidates at
different levels of the system - phonological, lexical, and syntactic - which in turn leads to shortlived between-candidate competition. In an fMRI study, we investigated how different kinds of
linguistic competition may be modulated by the presence or absence of a prior context (Tyler
1984; Tyler et al. 2008). We found significant effects of lexico-phonological competition for
isolated words, but not for words in short phrases, with high competition yielding greater
activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and posterior temporal regions. This suggests that
phrasal contexts reduce lexico-phonological competition by eliminating form-class inconsistent
cohort candidates. A corpus-derived measure of lexico-syntactic competition was associated with
greater activation in LIFG for verbs in phrases, but not for isolated verbs, indicating that lexicosyntactic information is boosted by the phrasal context. Together, these findings indicate that
LIFG plays a general role in resolving different kinds of linguistic competition.

Introduction
Understanding a spoken utterance involves neurocognitive processes at different levels of representation - acoustic, phonological, lexical, semantic, and syntactic. Because
speech is necessarily heard sequentially over time,
language comprehension is underpinned by continuous
processes of resolving transient ambiguities at each of
these levels. At both the lexico-phonological and syntactic
processing levels, research on whether and how multiple
candidate representations are activated and compete for
selection has generated several cognitive models
(Clifton, Frazier, & Connine, 1984; Ferreira & Clifton, 1986;
Luce & Pisoni, 1998; Macdonald, 1992; MacDonald, Pearlmutter, & Seidenberg, 1994; Marslen-Wilson, 1987;
Marslen-Wilson & Welsh, 1978; McClelland & Elman,
1986; Trueswell & Tanenhaus, 1994). For example, at the
lexical level, the cohort model (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson,
1997; Marslen-Wilson, 1987; Marslen-Wilson & Tyler,
1980; Marslen-Wilson & Welsh, 1978; Tyler & MarslenWilson, 1977) proposes that during spoken word processing, word-initial sounds (e.g. "/ael/" of "alligator") simultaneously activate a cohort of word candidates
("alcohol", "albatross", "alligator") sharing the same initial
sound sequence ("/ael/"). As more of the speech signal

unfolds, some members of the cohort become inconsistent with the perceptual input and their level of activation
decays. Words in the cohort that continue to be consistent
with the speech input continue to increase in activation,
until a point is reached when only one word remains consistent with the input (the uniqueness point). At the
uniqueness point, the correct word can be determined
unambiguously and all other competitors decay from
the cohort. Contextual information can facilitate the comprehension process by constraining the set of cohort competitors to those that are acceptable given the context -
for example, those cohort members that are grammatically appropriate to the context (Marslen-Wilson, 1987;
Tyler, 1984; Tyler & Wessels, 1983). Using a gating paradigm, Tyler (1984) showed a higher drop-out rate of
word candidates from the initial cohort pool when the
word was preceded by a strongly grammatically constraining sentence context (i.e. where the context constrains the following word to a particular grammatical
class, such as <noun>) compared to either a weakly constraining context or to words presented in isolation (no
sentential context). This suggests that word candidates
that are perceptually consistent with available input in
the unfolding utterance are continuously evaluated
against the current context and drop out of the cohort

pool when they are incongruent with grammatical constraints. Similarly, eye tracking data where French participants listened to spoken instructions suggest that a
gender-marked article preceding the noun functions to
eliminate the early activation of the gender-inconsistent
cohort members (Dahan, Swingley, Tanenhaus, & Magnuson, 2000; Magnuson, Tanenhaus, & Aslin, 2008). Studies
such as these demonstrate that cohort competition
effects during word recognition are subject to the topdown influence of contextual constraints.
Processes of competition and constraint may also be
fundamental mechanisms in how the appropriate syntactic structure for a sentence is constructed. As a sentence unfolds, multiple possible syntactic structures will
be consistent with the currently available input. For constraint-satisfaction models of sentence processing, many
syntactic possibilities are generated but their likelihood is
constrained by lexical information (Hagoort, 2005; MacDonald et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson, 1973; Vosse &
Kempen, 2000). Indeed, behavioural and neuroimaging
studies suggest that in the presence of unresolved syntactic ambiguities, people are sensitive to the likelihood
or preferences of the competing syntactic possibilities,
such that more likely alternatives are stronger competitors (e.g. MacDonald et al., 1994; Novais-Santos et al.,
2007; Rodd, Longe, Randall, & Tyler, 2010; Shapiro,
Nagel, & Levine, 1993; Trueswell & Tanenhaus, 1994;
Tyler et al., 2011; Tyler & Marslen-Wilson, 1977). For
example, when a verb is encountered, the multiple possible argument structures licenced by the verb vary in
their likelihood for the verb, and so constraint-satisfaction models will posit that the more likely argument
structures will be the stronger competitors.
However, it is unclear whether syntactic information
associated with a verb is automatically activated whenever it is heard. Although such information must be activated in order to understand the word's syntactic role
when it appears as part of a larger utterance, it may
not be relevant to recognising the word in isolation.
One proposal is that lexico-syntactic information is only
triggered when the word appears in a context requiring
greater linguistic (i.e. syntactic or morphological) processing (Longe, Randall, Stamatakis, & Tyler, 2007; Tyler,
Randall, & Stamatakis, 2008). Evidence for this claim is
that written verbs produce greater activation than
nouns in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (LpMTG;
BA 21) when they are in phrasal contexts (e.g. "you
drive", "a battle"), but not when they occur in isolation
(Tyler et al., 2008). Furthermore, verbs in minimal
phrasal contexts show greater activation than isolated
verbs in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) as well as
LpMTG, implicating both of these regions in the processing of verbs' lexico-syntactic information. In these earlier

studies, however, the syntactic information associated
with words was investigated at the level of their formclass (i.e. noun or verb). In the present study we aim
to test the hypothesis regarding the automaticity
of lexico-syntactic processing by investigating the
activation of lexico-syntactic knowledge at a more finegrained level, within the verb class, by modelling the
processing implications of verbs' subcategorisation
frame (i.e. argument structure) information. To this end,
we use a new corpus-based approach to measuring
a particular aspect of verb lexico-syntactic processing,
namely activation of and competition between subcategorisation frame possibilities for verbs.
In parallel to the cognitive models, contemporary
neural models have revealed a left-lateralised frontotemporal network underpinning fundamental language
functions (e.g. Boatman, 2004; Dronkers, Wilkins, Van
Valin, Redfern, & Jaeger, 2004; Hickok, 2012; Hickok &
Poeppel, 2004, 2007; Indefrey & Levelt, 2004; Scott &
Wise, 2004; Tyler & Marslen-Wilson, 2008). Syntactic representations are mainly supported by the LIFG and left
posterior temporal regions in a dynamic network
(Papoutsi, Stamatakis, Griffiths, Marslen-Wilson, & Tyler,
2011; Tyler et al., 2011; Tyler & Marslen-Wilson, 2008;
Tyler, Cheung, Devereux, & Clarke, 2013), in which LIFG
functions to integrate component words into a coherent
syntactic structure (Hagoort, 2005, 2013). In terms of cognitive competition processes, the LIFG has long been
claimed to play a domain-general role of selection
among competing representations (Badre, Poldrack,
Pare-Blagoev, Insler, & Wagner, 2005; Miller & Cohen,
2001; Thompson-Schill, Bedny, & Goldberg, 2005;
Thompson-Schill, D'Esposito, Aguirre, & Farah, 1997).
Supporting evidence has come from consistent activation of LIFG across various selection and competition
studies, including lexical competition (Zhuang, Randall,
Stamatakis, Marslen-Wilson, & Tyler, 2011; Zhuang,
Tyler, Randall, Stamatakis, & Marslen-Wilson, 2014),
semantic competition (Rodd, Davis, & Johnsrude, 2005),
and sentential syntactic competition (January, Trueswell,
& Thompson-Schill, 2008).
To explore the relationship between brain mechanisms for lexico-phonological and lexico-syntactic processing, we performed an fMRI study in which participants
listened and made lexical decisions to a series of
spoken nouns and verbs, presented either in isolation
or preceded by a short grammatical context. In the grammatical context condition, each noun and verb (e.g.
"book", "examine") was preceded by a function word
(e.g. "the", "you") which constrains the target word's
form-class to either noun or verb (e.g. "the book", "you
examine"). Compared to words presented in isolation,
these minimal phrasal contexts should function to

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

reduce the cohort of word-form competitors of the stems
to only those candidates which are form-class consistent
with the phrasal context, as found in behavioural studies
(Dahan et al., 2000; Tyler & Wessels, 1983). Any cohort
competition effect found in the isolated word condition
should be attenuated when isolated nouns and verbs
occur in constraining contexts, because in these contexts
a smaller number of grammatically congruent word candidates remain in the cohort. For syntactic competition,
however, we predict a reverse activation pattern - a
greater syntactic competition effect for verbs presented
in phrases, where the phrasal context triggers the activation of competing argument structure possibilities
for the verb, and a reduced syntactic competition
effect for verbs presented in isolation, where verb
lexico-syntactic knowledge is not relevant.
Investigating lexico-phonological and syntactic processing through the prism of competition necessitates
measures of both lexical competition over cohort
members and syntactic competition over the parse possibilities consistent with a given utterance. For our
stimuli, lexico-phonological competition is measured by
"cohort size" - the number of word candidates in a
cohort that share the same initial two phonemes with
the target word (e.g. "/ael/" of "alligator") (Tyler, Voice,
& Moss, 2000; Zhuang et al., 2011). Lexico-syntactic competition is competition over the different subcategorisation frame (i.e. argument structure) possibilities that are
consistent with the verb. In cognitive psychology and
cognitive neuroscience studies, the likelihood of different subcategorisation frames for verbs has typically
been estimated from behavioural experiments, where,
for example, participants write down continuations to
incomplete sentences or rate sentences for naturalness
(e.g. Connine, Ferreira, Jones, Clifton, & Frazier, 1984;
Garnsey, Pearlmutter, Myers, & Lotocky, 1997; NovaisSantos et al., 2007; Shapiro et al., 1993). However, some
studies suggest that the resultant behavioural frequencies may not provide an accurate reflection of the true
frequency of occurrence of each subcategorisation
frame with a given verb in corpus data (Merlo, 1994;
Roland & Jurafsky, 1998). In particular, the probability
that a participant chooses a particular frame for a verb
may not reflect the frequency with which that frame is
used with the verb in natural language. On the assumption that argument structure expectations associated
with verbs reflect statistical data on people's experience
of verbs in the language (Garnsey et al., 1997; Lapata,
Keller, & Walde, 2001; Merlo, 1994), we utilised a novel
approach to describing verb lexico-syntactic knowledge,
where competition between different subcategorisation
frame possibilities for a verb is measured by the
entropy of the conditional probability distribution of

223

subcategorisation frames given the verb, estimated
from corpus data. When the competing possibilities are
equally likely, the entropy of the distribution will be
high, and when one competitor is significantly more
likely than the others, entropy will be low. If, as we
predict, phrasal context triggers lexico-syntactic processing, then verbs with greater syntactic competition as
measured by entropy should show greater activation in
regions involved in competition and selection processes,
such as LIFG. In contrast, for verbs in isolation we predict
a reduced or null syntactic competition effect. Our predictions therefore posit a double-dissociation pattern
for lexico-phonological and lexico-syntactic competition
in the isolated words and phrases conditions.

Methods
Participants
Sixteen healthy volunteers (5 males, 11 females, aged
18-34 years) took part in this study. All were native
speakers of British English with normal hearing and
were right-handed (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory;
Oldfield, 1971). They gave informed consent and were
compensated for their time. This study was approved
by the Cambridgeshire 3 Research Ethics Committee, UK.

Design and materials
We first selected a set of 160 nouns and 160 verbs from
the CELEX database (Baayen, Piepenbrock, & van Rijn,
1993). The nouns and verbs were matched in imageability, frequency, number of syllables, and number of phonemes. All words were form-class-unambiguous,
meaning they could only occur as either a noun or
verb, as determined by their frequencies in CELEX. We
obtained measures of lexico-phonological competition
for each noun and verb stem using cohort size, that is,
the total number of words sharing the first two phonemes with the target word (e.g. "/ael/" of "alligator")
(Tyler et al., 2000; Zhuang et al., 2011). Lexico-phonological competition increases when cohort size becomes
larger with more word candidates competing with
each other in the cohort.
For verbs only, we also manipulated syntactic competition since each verb can be used with a variety of subcategorisation frame possibilities, which differ in their
relative likelihood for the verb. Using VALEX, a lexicon
of verb subcategorisation frame behaviour derived
from large corpora (Korhonen, Krymolowski, & Briscoe,
2006), we obtained the relative frequency with which
each verb was used with the 163 subcategorisation
frames specified by VALEX. We adopted an

224

J. ZHUANG AND B. J. DEVEREUX

information-theoretic framework for measuring competition between subcategorisation frames, in which the
notion of competition corresponds to the uncertainty
or unpredictability associated with a verbs' relative frequency distribution over the frames. Specifically, we
measured syntactic competition for verbs as the
entropy over subcategorisation frame relative frequency
distributions (see e.g. Moscoso del Prado Martin, Kostic, &
Baayen, 2004; Tabak, Schreuder, & Baayen, 2005, for a
similar approach to calculating uncertainty over inflection possibilities). For verbs that tend to have a few
highly preferred frames (e.g. replace, with transitive
frames) the entropy of the subcategorisation frame distribution will be very low, whereas for verbs that tend
to be used equally often with many different frames
(e.g. argue), the entropy of the subcategorisation frame
distribution will be high (Figure 1).
On the hypothesis that the activation of and competition between different subcategorisation frame options
is an important factor in verb processing, we would
expect that a verb that primarily occurs with a single
frame and only rarely occurs with other frames differs
from a verb that occurs with many frames with similar frequency, even if the verbs have the same number of subcategorisation frame options. Furthermore, by utilising a
measure of verbs' syntactic behaviour derived from
corpora, we avoid having to investigate syntactic processing effects through the use of syntactically or semantically anomalous conditions, such as designs with

Figure 1. Relative frequency distribution across subcategorization frames (SCFs) for a low entropy verb ("replace") and a
high entropy verb ("argue"). SCF codes refer to the subcategorisation frame classification scheme used in VALEX (Korhonen
et al., 2006). "Replace" occurs with just two frames over 98%
of the time; with the NP complement frame (SCF 24, e.g. "He
replaced the door") and with the NP-PP frame (SCF 49, e.g.
"He replaced the gold with silver"). "Argue" has high entropy
because it occurs with many different frames; as well as the NP
and NP-PP frames it also occurs with the intransitive frame
(SCF 22; "They argued"), the sentential complement frame (SCF
104; "He argued that it was wrong"), the PP frame (SCF 87, "He
argued with me"), and so on.

grammatical errors, violations of verb argument structure
(Raettig, Frisch, Friederici, & Kotz, 2010), or implausible
interpretations (Price, 2010). The entropy measure gives
a continuous measure of syntactic competition, which
was matched across the high and low cohort competition
conditions of the experiment.
Words were presented both as isolated stems and in
phrases. For the phrasal condition, each word was preceded by a function word which constrained its formclass to either a noun or verb (e.g. "a monkey", "you
examine"). Three articles ("a", "the", and "this") and
three pronouns ("I", "they", and "you") were used as preceding contexts for the nouns and verbs in the phrase
conditions, respectively. To avoid repetition of the
same stem words across the isolated word condition
and the phrase condition for any participant, the
stimuli within each condition were divided into
matched halves to form two experimental versions.
Each participant only received one of the two versions,
such that each participant heard all 320 nouns and
verbs only once, half in the isolated stem condition
and half in the phrase condition.
Our use of a single one-syllable determiner or
pronoun as the grammatical context in the phrase condition assumes that even such a minimal linguistic
context is sufficient to trigger automatic syntactic processing of the verb (in particular, activation of verb subcategorisation frame possibilities) that is absent in the
isolated word condition. Although a richer lexico-syntactic context (i.e. if the verb was embedded in a complete
sentence) may make detailed lexico-syntactic processing
of the verb more likely and even obligatory, a richer
context would also introduce acoustic, semantic and syntactic structure variability that is irrelevant to our experimental questions and which would not be present in the
isolated word condition. Previous research (Tyler et al.,
2008) has shown that a minimal context is sufficient to
generate increased activation for verbs relative to
nouns and relative to verbs in isolation.
We used a lexical decision task and included an equal
number (320) of non-words as fillers, half of which were
in the isolated word condition and half in the phrase condition with the same preceding pronouns and articles.
We also included two baseline conditions, one of
which was composed of 80 null events (silence), and
the other of 280 items of envelope-shaped musical rain
(MuR). Similar to speech, the MuR items contain a
complex and rapidly changing frequency composition
(Uppenkamp, Johnsrude, Norris, Marslen-Wilson, & Patterson, 2006). MuR can be used to separate low-level
acoustic processing from lexical processing, as it activates the primary auditory receiving areas (Heschl's
gyrus and planum temporale) to a similar level as

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

speech, but produces less activation than speech in secondary auditory regions such as the anterior and superior
STS/STG (Scott, Blank, Rosen, & Wise, 2000; Tyler et al.,
2010). One hundred and sixty of the MuR stimuli had
normal pitch while the other 120 were made lowpitched by reducing the pitch of the original MuR
items. This contrast enabled us to use a high/low judgement of pitch task with the MuR stimuli, which was
chosen to approximate the attentional demands of the
lexical decision task that was used with the words and
non-words. Half of the MuR items were matched for duration to the real words, and the other half was matched
for duration to phrases. Non-word and baseline items
were the same across the two experimental versions.
Noun and verb phrases were naturally longer (on
average by 198 ms) than stems due to the presence of
the function word. To account for this, duration was partialled out as an extraneous covariate in the analyses on
both the behavioural and imaging data.

Procedure
The stimuli were recorded by a female native speaker of
British English at a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz and downsampled (22,050 Hz, 16 bit resolution, Mono-channel) for
presentation with the experimental software. To make
the stimulus sounds as natural as possible, the words
and non-words were recorded once in isolation and
once in phrases, rather than splicing the isolated words
from the recordings of the phrases. The mean duration
was 628 ms (SD = 113 ms) for the isolated words and
833 ms (SD = 123 ms) for the phrases.
The experiment consisted of two versions. In each
version half of the stimuli were presented as isolated
words, and half as phrases. Half of the participants
were randomly allocated to each version. Each experimental version was composed of 1000 items: 320 real
words (160 stem words, 160 phrases), 320 non-words,
280 musical rain items and 80 null events. The
nonword filler and baseline items were randomly interspersed with the real word stimuli with the same order
across the two versions.
Spoken stimuli were delivered to participants during
scanning via the high-quality Nordic Neuro Labs (NNL)
electrostatic headphones. Participants were instructed
to make a lexical decision to real words and nonwords in isolation or in phrases (i.e. the second word
in the phrases) by pressing response keys using their
right hand index finger for real words and middle
finger for non-words, and also to the pitch of MuR
items (normal pitch MuR or low-pitch MuR with index
and middle fingers, respectively). No task was required
on the silence trials. Participants were asked to

225

respond as quickly and accurately as possible on each
trial. Response times were recorded from the beginning
of the target word for both words in isolation and in
phrases.

MRI acquisition and imaging analysis
Scanning was performed on a 3 T Tim Trio (Siemens,
Munich, Germany) at the MRC Cognition and Brain
Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK, using a gradient-echo
EPI sequence with head coils. Each functional scan consisted of 32 oblique axial slices, 3 mm thick (0.75 mm
gap between slices) with in-plane resolution of 3 mm.
Repetition time (TR) = 3.4 s, acquisition time (TA) = 2 s,
echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle 78, and field of view
= 192 mm x 192 mm. MPRAGE T1-weighted scans were
acquired for anatomical localisation.
We used a fast sparse imaging protocol (Hall et al.,
1999) in which speech sounds were presented in the
1.4 seconds of silence between scans. There was a
silent gap of 100 ms between the end of a scan and
the onset of the subsequent stimulus, minimising the
influence of preceding scanning noise on the perception
of the speech sounds, especially their onsets. The time
between successive stimuli was naturally jittered under
this protocol since the duration of each stimulus varies,
which increases the chance of sampling the peak of
the haemodynamic response.
Pre-processing and statistical analysis were carried
out in SPM5 (Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology,
London, UK. www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk), under MATLAB
(Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). EPI images were
realigned to the first EPI image (excluding five initial
lead-in images) to correct for head motion, then spatially
normalised to a standard MNI (Montreal Neurological
Institute) EPI template, using a cutoff of 25 mm for the
discrete cosine transform functions. Statistical modelling
was done in the context of the general linear model as
implemented in SPM5, using a 8 mm full-width halfmaximal Gaussian smoothing kernel.
In the fixed effect analysis for each participant, we
used a parametric modulation design (Buchel, Wise,
Mummery, Poline, & Friston, 1996; Henson, 2003) to
model the experimental conditions. Two analyses were
performed with the first model focussing on phrasal
context effect and cohort competition (cohort size)
effect over nouns and verbs, and the second model on
lexico-syntactic competition (entropy) effect for the
verbs (the two analyses reflect the fact that cohort size
is defined for both nouns and verbs but subcategorisation frame entropy is defined only for the verbs). In the
first analysis, the design matrix of each scanning
session consisted of five independent events (isolated

226

J. ZHUANG AND B. J. DEVEREUX

words, word phrases, non-words, MuR, and null events)
with the first two events (isolated words, word phrases)
modulated by three parametric modulators: stimulus
duration, word frequency, and cohort size (log-transformed). All three modulators were composed of continuous data, and they were orthogonolised in a serial
order from left to right, so the duration and frequency
difference among items was partialled out for the
effect of cohort competition (as is standard for SPM parametric modulator analysis). In the second analysis, the
design matrix of each scanning session consisted of six
independent events (verbs in isolation, verb phrases,
nouns, non-words, MuR, and null events) with the first
two events (verbs in isolation, verb phrases) modulated
by three parametric modulators: stimulus duration,
word frequency, and syntactic competition (entropy).
As in the first analysis, all modulators were composed
of continuous data, and they were orthogonolised in
the same serial order (stimulus duration and word frequency were partialled out for the effect of syntactic
competition).
In addition to the syntactic competition effect,
another approach to investigating the neural basis of
syntactic representation is to compare nouns and
verbs. Verbs substantially differ from nouns in that they
serve a key grammatical function in sentences by combining other words in a sentence into a coherent representation. Because of the rich grammatical
information in verbs (such as information about licenced
and preferred argument structures) which is absent in
nouns, comparing nouns and verbs provides an
additional means of exploring the neural substrate of
syntactic processing. An additional analysis was therefore performed to contrast nouns and verbs. The
design matrix of each scanning session was composed
of four independent events (all words, non-words, MuR,
and null events) with the first event modulated by six
modulators: stimulus duration, word frequency, nouns
in isolation, verbs in isolation, noun phrases, and verb
phrases. All the modulators were treated in parallel,
with each modulator orthogonolised against all other
modulators. For each of the four experimental modulators, stimulus duration and word frequency were partialled out as extraneous variables.
Trials were modelled using a canonical haemodynamic response function, and the onset of each stimulus was taken as the onset of the trial in the SPM analysis
model. For word phrases, we took the beginning of the
function words as trial onset since the mean duration
of the function words was only 215 ms and BOLD
signals are insensitive to such short time differences.
The data for each participant were first analysed using
the fixed effects model and then combined into a

group random effects analysis. Activations were thresholded at p < .005, uncorrected, at the voxel level, and
significant clusters are reported only when they survive
p < .05, cluster-level corrected for multiple comparisons,
unless otherwise stated. SPM coordinates are reported
in MNI space. Regions were identified by using the AAL
atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) and Brodmann templates as implemented in MRIcron (http://www.MRicro.
com/MRicron).
Since this study was aimed at investigating modulation within the language processing network, a bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal mask was applied to all
the contrasts in the group random effects analyses
(Bozic, Tyler, Su, Wingfield, & Marslen-Wilson, 2013;
Diaz et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2011). This mask consisted
of bilateral IFG (BA 44, 45, 47), insula, anterior cingulate,
STG, MTG, angular gyri, inferior parietal lobule, and
supramarginal gyri. The mask covered the typical left
perisylvian language areas that are of theoretical interest
and their right hemisphere homologues (Dronkers et al.,
2004; Friederici, 2012; Hickok & Poeppel, 2004, 2007;
Petersson & Hagoort, 2012; Tyler & Marslen-Wilson,
2008), while excluding regions not typically involved in
language processing. For visualisation, the volumetric
statistically thresholded activation maps were projected
onto the PALS-B12 surface atlas in CARET version 5.6.

Results
Behavioural results
The data from two stimulus items ("hurtle", "you renege")
were removed due to high error rate (100%). Only data
from correct responses (93.6%) were included in the
reaction time analyses. The reaction times were
inverse-transformed to account for the outliers in the
data (Ratcliff, 1993; Ulrich & Miller, 1994), then analysed
across items (F2). Error analyses are not reported as the
overall error rate is quite low (5.4%), and not more
than 9.0% in any of the experimental conditions.
As duration was significantly correlated with RTs (r =
0.29, p < .001), we partialled it out as a covariate in the
analyses. In an ANCOVA on all items with duration partialled out, there was a significant effect of phrasal
context, F2(1, 633) = 7.37, p < .01, with word phrases
(mean RT = 891 ms) being recognised faster (16 ms)
than words in isolation (mean RT = 907 ms), indicating
a facilitatory effect of grammatical context. Cohort size
(log-transformed) significantly correlated with RTs for
words in isolation, r = 0.12, p < .05, but not for word
phrases, r = -0.001, p > .1. To test whether the
correlation between cohort size and RT for words in isolation differed from the correlation between cohort size

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

and RT for words in phrases, we performed a Steiger's Z
test for non-independent correlations (Steiger, 1980;
www.psychmike.com/dependent_correlations.php), and
observed a significant difference (Z = 2.09, p = .036), indicating that increasing cohort competition inhibited the
recognition process of words in isolation, but not
words in phrases. In other words, phrasal contexts facilitate spoken word recognition by eliminating form-class
inappropriate candidates and in doing so attenuate the
influence of cohort competition. The correlation
between RTs and syntactic competition (entropy) for
verbs in isolation was not significant, r = -.05, p > .1,
nor was it significant for verb phrases, r = -0.06, p > .1.
The absence of syntactic competition effects indicate
that the behavioural data collected for the lexical
decision task during scanning may not be sensitive to
lexico-syntactic information.

Imaging results
We first established that the task and stimuli elicited activation within those regions of the brain typically activated in language tasks by directly contrasting the
activation resulting from MuR items (compared to
silence) and real words (including all isolated words
and phrases, compared to MuR). The contrast of MuR
minus silence tapped into the neural basis of low-level
acoustic processing, whilst words minus MuR examined
the fundamental features of the spoken language processing network over and above that due to sound processing. Greater neural activation for MuR items
compared to silence was focussed primarily in the bilateral STG (BA 41, 42, 22), extending into bilateral MTG (BA
22, 21), inferior parietal lobule and supramarginal gyri
(BA 40) and LIFG (BA 45). These results replicate previous
studies showing that the purely acoustic features of
speech-like sounds (as represented by MuR) are processed mainly in bilateral STG around Heschl's gyrus.
Words were associated with significantly greater activation than MuR primarily along bilateral MTG (BA 21,
22), extending into bilateral anterior STG (BA 22, 38)
and LIFG (BA 44, 45, 47). In accordance with previous
studies (e.g. Davis & Johnsrude, 2003), these two
effects show a hierarchical activation pattern with lowlevel acoustic information analysed in bilateral Heschl's
gyri and surrounding STG, while more inferior and
anterior regions (e.g. bilateral MTG, LIFG) are involved
in higher level lexical processing.
To investigate the effect of phrasal context, we subtracted words in isolation from word phrases, while partialling out stimulus duration as an extraneous variable.
Word phrases elicited more activation than isolated
words in LIFG (BA 44, 45, 47), and left middle and

227

posterior MTG (BA 21, 22) (Table 1 and Figure 2(a)). The
IFG activation is consistent with previous findings on syntactic processing (e.g. Caplan, Alpert, Waters, & Olivieri,
2000; Hagoort, 2005; Santi & Grodzinsky, 2010;
Thothathiri, Kim, Trueswell, & Thompson-Schill, 2012;
Tyler et al., 2010, 2011). To visualise the phrasal context
effect, we took the significant clusters (Figure 2(a)) as
ROIs (regions of interest) using MarsBaR (http://
marsbar.sourceforge.net/), and extracted the mean
value of activation within the ROIs for words in isolation
and word phrases separately (Figure 2(b)).
To examine the brain mechanisms of lexico-phonological competition and whether this competition effect
varied as a function of phrasal contexts, we correlated
cohort size with neural activation in the isolated word
and phrase conditions, separately. For isolated words,
increasing cohort competition generated greater activation in the LIFG (BA 45), bilateral posterior MTG/STG
(BA 21, 22), extending into left supramarginal gyrus
and inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) (Table 1 and
Figure 3(a)). However, for the phrases there was no significant effect of cohort competition even at a lower
voxel threshold of p <.01, uncorrected, and p < .05,
cluster-level corrected. We performed an interaction
analysis by subtracting the cohort competition effect in
phrases from the cohort competition effect in isolated
words, and observed a significant effect in the LIFG (BA
44, 45) and bilateral posterior regions including posterior
MTG/STG, supramarginal gyri and angular gyri (BA 21, 22,
39; see Table 1 and Figure 3(b)).
We further investigated the cohort competition effect
using independent ROIs from previous research on
lexical competition (Bozic, Tyler, Ives, Randall, &
Marslen-Wilson, 2010). We constructed two ROIs based
on the competition effect activation peaks ([-48 18 4]
and [54 30 0], in LIFG and RIFG) reported by Bozic et al.
(2010) with a sphere of radius 10 mm. We then extracted
the mean activity of each ROI in the isolated word and
phrase conditions, respectively. As shown in Figure 3(c),
and consistent with the interaction effect reported
above, neural activity for isolated words was significantly
higher than that in the phrase condition in the LIFG ROI,
t(15) = 4.08, p < .001, and also in the RIFG ROI, t(15) =
2.03, p < .05.
As described above, we investigated the neural signatures of lexico-syntactic processing in two ways: by investigating the syntactic competition (entropy) effect within
the verbs alone and by contrasting verbs and nouns. We
correlated neural activity and syntactic competition for
verbs in isolation and phrase conditions, separately,
and found no significant effects of syntactic competition
for verbs in isolation even when we lowered the
threshold to p < .01, voxel-level uncorrected, and

in the LIFG ROI, t(15) = 1.83, p < .05, but not in the RIFG
ROI, t(15) < 1 (Figure 4(b)). The different entropy effects
for the isolated verbs and phrases in the LIFG ROI
suggest that activation of lexico-syntactic information
associated with verbs is triggered when the word is
heard as part of a phrase but not when it is heard in isolation (Tyler et al., 2008).
In comparing nouns to verbs, no significant differences were found between isolated nouns and isolated
verbs, nor between noun phrases and verb phrases,
suggesting that no grammatical effect survived in
direct comparisons. However, grammatical information
might be partially activated for verbs in isolation,
showing an intermediate level of activation between isolated nouns and verb phrases. To test this possibility, we
performed a correlational analysis with isolated nouns,
isolated verbs and verb phrases as three graded levels
(1, 2, 3), and found a significant positive correlational

effect in the LIFG (BA 44, 45, 47) and left posterior
MTG/STG (BA 21, 22) (Table 1 and Figure 5(a)). To visualise the differences between the three levels, mean neural
activity in these two significant clusters was extracted in
each experimental condition using MarsBaR, then
plotted as shown in Figure 5(b). These results demonstrate a linear relationship among these conditions with
increasing activation in left fronto-temporal regions
from isolated nouns to isolated verbs, to verb phrases.

Discussion
In this study we investigated how phrasal contexts affect
lexico-phonological (measured by cohort size) and
lexico-syntactic processing (measured by entropy) in
spoken word recognition. We found a significant effect
of phrasal syntax with word phrases producing more
activation than words in isolation in LIFG (BA 45/44/47)

and left middle and posterior MTG (BA 21, 22). There was
a significant cohort competition effect in LIFG (BA 45)
and bilateral posterior temporal regions for isolated
words, but not in word phrases. In the ROI analysis, the
cohort competition effects was reduced for phrasal contexts in both LIFG and RIFG ROIs. For lexico-syntactic
competition processing, the activation pattern was
reversed - there was a significant entropy effect for
verbs in phrases, with greater activation in the LIFG ROI
(BA 44, 45) for increasing syntactic competition;
however, this effect was not significant for verbs in
isolation.
The LIFG activation for cohort competition for words
in isolation replicates previous findings with the same
cohort competition measure (Zhuang et al., 2011).

More broadly, this finding accords with previous
studies that implicate these frontal regions in resolving
competition and selecting among multiple candidates
(e.g. Bozic et al., 2010; Moss et al., 2005; ThompsonSchill et al., 2005). The activation in bilateral temporal
regions might be related to the extra demands of retrieving lexical phonological and semantic information of
more cohort candidates in the high compared to low
competition items, since these regions have been
claimed to be involved in lexical access of spoken
words (e.g. Hickok & Poeppel, 2007; Jung-Beeman,
2005; Longworth, Marslen-Wilson, Randall, & Tyler,
2005). The eliminated cohort competition effect in
word phrases is consistent with a role of contextual constraints that function to narrow down the initial cohort

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

size and thus reduce cohort competition. In addition, the
onsets of the isolated words may be more salient than
the onsets of the same words in phrases due to co-articulation between the nouns/verbs and preceding functional words. The less salient onsets of nouns/verbs in
phrases might induce activation of word candidates
both within and outside the cohort. The additional activation of non-cohort competitors might have an effect
on the level of cohort competition in phrases, but the
mechanisms remain unclear since no evidence has
shown that non-cohort competitors would prohibit activation of cohort members, or reduce effects of withincohort competition. There was a significant correlational
effect with increasing activation in the LIFG and left posterior MTG/STG when grammatical/syntactic information
increased from isolated nouns to isolated verbs and verb
phrases. This indicates that grammatical information is
automatically activated to a limited extent in verbs in isolation, although it was not detectable in direct comparisons between nouns and verbs. In this study we only
chose form-class-unambiguous nouns and verbs as
stimuli without any form-class-ambiguous words which
could be used as both nouns and verbs in different contexts. The grammatical information is relatively more
easily detected in pure verbs without interference from
other syntactic properties, compared to ambiguous
words (i.e. words that can be either verb or noun, e.g.
kiss) with multiple possible syntactic roles, only one of
which is sensitive to subcategorisation frame information. This might explain why previous research did
not find a similar weak grammatical effect in verbs in isolation compared to nouns (e.g. Tyler et al., 2008). One
caveat for this correlational effect is that isolated nouns
and isolated verbs might also differ from each other in
other aspects such as activation levels of action representations, attention, and so on. It is impossible to avoid
these potential confounds in analyses with nouns and
verbs.
The activation of LIFG (BA 45/44) for syntactic competition for verbs in phrases accords with previous studies
that implicate these frontal regions in resolving competition and selecting among multiple candidates (Bozic
et al., 2010; Moss et al., 2005; Thompson-Schill et al.,
2005; Thothathiri et al., 2012). This effect, together with
the null effect of lexico-syntactic competition for verbs
in isolation, is also consistent with the notion that
neural processing of words is modulated by the extent
to which different kinds of relevant (e.g. morphological
or syntactic) information is engaged (Longe et al., 2007;
Tyler et al., 2008). Lexico-syntactic knowledge of a
spoken verb is boosted in a phrasal context because
such information is needed to guide phrase structure
building for the emerging utterance, whereas it is not

231

necessary to fully activate lexico-syntactic representations for a verb heard in isolation (although it might
be automatically activated to a very limited extent)
because there is no such need of grammatical integration. Only when multiple subcategorisation frame
possibilities are triggered and activated by phrasal contexts could we detect effects of syntactic competition.
The co-activation of left inferior frontal and posterior
temporal regions seems to be critical for syntactic representation, both in sentential syntactic processing and
in short phrasal syntactic processing (Tyler et al., 2008;
Tyler & Marslen-Wilson, 2008). The phrasal syntax effect
and the correlational syntactic effect in this study
provide further evidence supporting this claim in that
even very simple function words (e.g. "you") could
trigger both LIFG and left middle and posterior MTG to
work together in building syntactic structures.
However, the co-activation pattern of left fronto-temporal regions was not consistently observed in cohort
competition and lexico-syntactic competition effects,
indicating that the LIFG itself might fulfil the function
of selection, with the posterior temporal regions in
cohort competition more involved in the retrieval of relevant lexical information.
The cohort competition effect was significant in both
LIFG and RIFG in the ROI analysis; however, the syntactic
competition effect was significant only in LIFG. This
pattern of results suggests that RIFG may be sensitive to
competition at a lexico-phonological level, but not at
the syntactic level. This is consistent with the dual
system model (Bozic et al., 2010; Tyler & Marslen-Wilson,
2008) which posits that a bilateral fronto-temporal
system is engaged in basic non-combinatorial processes
of lexico-phonological access, whilst a left-lateralised
system is specialised for combinatorial linguistic processes, such as syntax.
One notable finding of this study is that the phrasal
contexts effect, the correlational syntactic effect, the
cohort competition effect for isolated words and
entropy effect for verb phrases overlap largely in a subregion of LIFG - L triangularis (BA 45). L triangularis (BA
45) might be the most frequently reported sub-region
of LIFG for multiple cognitive functions, including
general control or selection processing (Badre et al.,
2005; Bozic & Marslen-Wilson, 2010; Moss et al., 2005;
Righi, Blumstein, Mertus, & Worden, 2009; Schnur et al.,
2009; Thompson-Schill et al., 1997; Thompson-Schill,
Aguirre, Desposito, & Farah, 1999; Wright, Randall,
Marslen-Wilson, & Tyler, 2010; Zhuang et al., 2011) and
syntactic processing (e.g. Friederici, Bahlmann, Heim,
Schubotz, & Anwander, 2006; Kaan & Swaab, 2002;
Santi & Grodzinsky, 2007; Tyler et al., 2011). This finding
provides direct evidence to support this notion that L

232

J. ZHUANG AND B. J. DEVEREUX

triangularis (BA 45) is engaged, at multiple linguistic
levels, in selecting an appropriate candidate among
competitors and combining several constitutes into a
coherent representation.
In summary, this study demonstrates that phrasal
contexts function to eliminate cohort competition in
recognition of spoken words and boost activation of
lexico-syntactic properties within interactive bilateral
fronto-temporal processing systems. The LIFG is a critical
language region with multiple functions in building syntactic structure, and in resolving lexical and syntactic
competition according to different processing needs.
