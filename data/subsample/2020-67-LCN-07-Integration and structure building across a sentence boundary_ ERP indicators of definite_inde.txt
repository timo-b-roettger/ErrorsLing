ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Text comprehension requires integrating meanings within and across sentences. However,
sentence boundaries mark an occasion for readers to begin a new structure - integration with
prior meanings is not immediately required in the absence of a retrieval cue to a text segment
in memory. In an ERP study we investigated a grammatical cue for integration, the definite
article. We varied whether definite (the) or indefinite articles (a/an) occurred at sentence-initial
positions and whether the article was followed by a repeated noun. Evidence for lexical-semantic
facilitation for repeated nouns was observed as a centro-parietal N400 effect. Early frontal and
Late Positivity Component (LPC) effects differentiated nouns that followed definite articles from
those that followed indefinite articles. Following definite articles, an increased LPC occurred
when readers encountered new nouns compared with repeated nouns; this effect was not
present when nouns followed indefinite articles. Results show readers' sensitivity to cues for coreferential integration and new structure building.

English articles signal the information status of the noun
phrases they begin. The definite article the can signal
that the noun phrase may be co-referential with a
meaning already established by the preceding text. In
contrast, the indefinite article a/an suggests that the
noun phrase has no corresponding referent in memory,
encouraging the reader to build a new structure. This
information-cueing role of the article has been a focus
of study in discourse, grounded in the given-new distinction (Ferreira & Lowder, 2016; Halliday, 1967; Haviland &
Clark, 1974): The implies the noun phrase is given information, whereas a/an implies it is new information.
The role of article definiteness has been shown to
function in comprehension in previous behavioural
(Gernsbacher & Robertson, 2001; Haviland & Clark,
1974) and event-related potential (ERP) research (Anderson & Holcomb, 2005). In behavioural studies, readers
read sentences containing definite articles faster than
those containing indefinite articles, suggesting that
switching to a new structure or sub-structure is more
effortful than integrating onto an existing one (e.g.
Gernsbacher, 1997).
In this research, we draw attention to the role of the
definite article at the beginning of a new sentence,
where the reader's primary obligation is to build a new
structure, thus making integration with preceding text
optional (Calloway & Perfetti, 2017; Helder, Perfetti,

van den Broek, Stafura, & Calloway, 2019). On this
assumption, integration with prior text information
occurs only when the sentence beginning contains a
strong retrieval cue for a referent already established in
the text. A noun that is repeated across a sentence
boundary is a strong cue for memory-based integration.
However, successful integration should occur only if the
noun is preceded by the definite article and not by the
indefinite article. Consider the reader's task in the following two cases.
(1) Martha went shopping recently and received many
complements on her sweater. The sweater she was
wearing had red and green patterns.
(2) Martha went shopping recently and received many
complements on her sweater. A sweater is the
perfect completion to any winter outfit.
The definite article the in example (1) makes it more likely
that sweater refers to the same sweater established in the
first sentence - i.e. the two appearances of sweater are
co-referential. In example (2), the indefinite article
signals to the reader that what follows has not been
established in the text; i.e. the two instances of sweater
are not co-referential.
In the present study, we use ERPs to examine the
effects of noun repetition and article definiteness (the

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

vs. a/an) on integration across a sentence boundary.
Among other ERP components, a repeated noun may
produce a reduced N400, an indicator of meaning congruence, when it is preceded by either a definite or
indefinite article. However, an effect on the repeated
noun when it is preceded by an indefinite article
cannot readily be interpreted as showing co-referential
integration. Instead it would suggest a simpler lexicalsemantic repetition effect. In example (2), the indefinite
article invites the reader to construct a new noun
phrase, either a generic entity <sweater> as in example
(2) or an entity that will eventually be referentially
specified. For instance, example (2) could continue as:
A sweater Martha bought last year was very similar
except for its red colour. In neither case does the reader
understand "sweater" as co-referential with the sweater
named in the first sentence. Sensitivity to the referential
cuing values of a noun's grammatical properties may
vary, even among adult English speakers, and have consequences for comprehension. Accordingly, we assessed
readers' comprehension skill to examine whether comprehension ability influenced readers' sensitivity to
article cues.
To examine these questions of referential integration,
we measured ERPs to critical nouns at the beginning of a
sentence, as in examples (1) and (2), where sweater is the
critical noun. The N400, a measure that broadly reflects
text integration (i.e. mapping) and congruence effects
(Calloway & Perfetti, 2017; Kutas & Hillyard, 1980; Van
Berkum, Hagoort, & Brown, 1998) is the component of
main interest. Further, across a sentence boundary, the
N400 can be interpreted as an indicator of memorybased meaning integration (Stafura, Rickles, & Perfetti,
2015; Yang, Perfetti, & Schmalhofer, 2007), in contrast
to effects later in a sentence that are often interpreted
as predictive effects (e.g. Brothers, Swaab, & Traxler,
2015; Federmeier, Wlotko, De Ocha-Dewald, & Kutas,
2007; Kutas & Hillyard, 1980; Ng, Payne, Steen, StineMorrow, & Federmeier, 2017). Of note, predictive processes, when they occur, can facilitate integrative processes (Karimi & Ferreira, 2016; Lau, Phillips, & Poeppel,
2008; McNamara, 2005). In a direct comparison of prediction and memory-based integration measures, Calloway
and Perfetti (2017) found that the integration measures
predicted the N400 across a sentence boundary with
no additional explanation provided by cloze-assessed
predictability.
Although in text reading, modulation of the N400 can
reflect co-referential meaning integrative processes, it
can also reflect lexical-semantic priming. Anderson and
Holcomb (2005) tested the separation of these two processes with an article manipulation in which the or a/an
preceded a repeated word or a synonym from the first

125

sentence. Both synonyms and repetitions showed
reduced N400s compared to the first occurrence of the
word and to unrelated words. Repeated words had
reduced N400s compared to synonyms. However, a
failure to find an article effect for either the word repetition or synonym condition suggested that these
effects were due to lexical-semantic processes rather
than co-referential processes. It is possible that the prominence of lexical-semantic repetition and priming
effects made weaker co-referential effects unobservable.
Also, because the unrelated (baseline) condition did not
consistently include an article with the noun, it might not
have provided a well-matched comparison with the
experimental conditions.
In the present study, we use a baseline condition in
which the noun phrase across a sentence boundary contained a non-repeated noun that was contextually unrelated to the preceding sentence. The unrelated noun in
the baseline condition was preceded by either a
definite or indefinite article. Examples (3) and (4) show
these conditions, complementing the repeated noun
conditions of examples (1) and (2).
(1) Martha went shopping for kitchenware recently and
received many complements on her kitchen's
design. The sweater she wore matched the room
perfectly.
(2) Martha went shopping for kitchenware recently and
received many complements on her kitchen's
design. A sweater she owned matched the colours
perfectly.
In addition to an N400 effect, two other components
are of interest. One is the LAN, a left anterior negativity
300-700 ms post-stimulus that has been associated
with working memory (Friederici, Hahne, & Mecklinger,
1996; King & Kutas, 1995). In the experiment described
above, Anderson and Holcomb (2005) found an
increased LAN for words following definite articles compared with words following indefinite articles. The
increased LAN may reflect the need, signalled by the
definite article, to hold prior information in memory to
be attached to upcoming information (Anderson &
Holcomb).
Also, of interest are late positivities that occur 500-
900 ms post-stimulus, identified as a P600 and the Late
Positivity Component (LPC). These late positivities are
observed in text reading studies as well as recognition,
priming, and word repetition studies, and their interpretation varies accordingly. In recognition memory studies,
frontal positivities have been interpreted as reflecting
familiarity, whereas parietal positivities have been interpreted as reflecting recollection (Rugg et al., 1998;

126

R. C. CALLOWAY AND C. A. PERFETTI

Rugg & Curran, 2007; Woodruff, Hayama, & Rugg, 2006).
Evidence from text reading research suggests that parietal LPCs may reflect sentence repair (DeLong, Quante, &
Kutas, 2014; Friederici et al., 1996; Van Petten & Luka,
2012) or other updating processes linked to inference
generation (Burkhardt, 2007). LPC Word repetition
effects depend on whether repeated words occur in a
list or text. In list reading studies, repeated words have
greater parietal LPCs than non-repeated words (i.e. the
old/new effect; Rugg & Curran, 2007). Findings from a
sentence reading study show a different pattern, with
greater positivities for non-repeated words compared
to words repeated within a sentence (e.g. Van Petten,
Kutas, Kluender, Mitchiner, & McIsaac, 1991). The
increased positivity for non-repeated words might
reflect effort involved in creating a new memory trace
(Neville, Kutas, Chesney, & Schmidt, 1986; Van Petten
et al., 1991). In the case of reading connected text, the
greater parietal positivities found when inferences are
required to maintain coherence suggests an updating
(i.e. integrative) process in which effort is required to
update the reader's mental model (Burkhardt, 2007).
Although these two interpretations are rather different,
they share the assumption that the LPC reflects
memory processes necessary for comprehension.

new, readers should not attempt to update their
mental models, but instead build a new mental structure.
If structure building is the default mechanism at the
beginning of a sentence, we expect LPC effects for
definite articles to be similar to those predicted for
indefinite articles. Finally, we test whether higherskilled comprehenders are more sensitive to article
cues for co-reference, and thus show larger effects
during one or more time windows that capture
different phases of word-to-text integration.

Method
Participants
Participants were sixty-three college students (Mage =
19.25, SD = 1.61; 32 males and 31 females), all righthanded native English speakers with no reported neurological or visual impairments. All participants were given
informed consent prior to the start of the experimental
session and were compensated with course credit. Participants' comprehension was assessed via reading comprehension and vocabulary tests, as explained in the
results section.

Measures
The present study
The present study aims to test whether the N400, LAN,
and LPC are indicators of structure building and co-referential integration. We use two-sentence texts in which
the first sentence establishes a context and the second
sentence begins with a noun phrase with either a
definite (i.e. The) or indefinite article (i.e. A/An) followed
by a noun.
We hypothesised that a separation of co-referential
effects would be found in the N400. An N400 reduction
for repeated nouns independent of the preceding
article would suggest simple lexical-semantic repetition.
A larger reduction in the N400 when the noun is preceded by the definite article suggests co-referential integration. Based on Anderson and Holcomb's (2005)
results, we should expect an increased LAN for nouns
after definite articles only. If the parietal LPC reflects
recollection processes during sentence reading, we
expect an increased parietal LPC for repeated nouns
after definite articles (old entities) but not indefinite
articles (new entities) at parietal sites. However, if the
parietal LPC reflects model updating, nouns that follow
definite articles should have greater positivities than
nouns that follow indefinite articles, indicating model
updating via co-referential integration. Because indefinite articles cue that upcoming information will be

Participants completed the vocabulary and reading comprehension components of the Nelson-Denny comprehension test (Brown, Bennett, & Hanna, 1981). They
had a 15-minute time limit to complete the eightpassage comprehension portion that contained 36 questions and a 7.5-minute time limit to complete the 100item vocabulary portion. Nelson-Denny tests assess
semantic knowledge along with literal and inferential
comprehension abilities. The maximum scores for the
comprehension and vocabulary assessments were 36
and 100, respectively. Participants also completed a
modified version of the Author Recognition
Test (ART) which serves as a measure of reading experience (Stanovich & West, 1989). In this task, participants
selected names they believed were authors from a list
of names. Participants were discouraged from guessing
and lost points for incorrect responses.

Materials
We implemented a 2 (Article type: Definite vs. Indefinite) x 2 (Repetition: Repeated vs. Non-repeated nouns)
within subjects design. There were 120 two-sentence
texts per condition (480 total). See Table 1 for examples.
Due to time restrictions, there were no filler sentences in
this experiment. The second sentence of each passage

either began with a definite (i.e. The) or indefinite (i.e. A/
An) article and target nouns were always nouns that
immediately followed these articles. Except for one 3letter word, the target words were 4-9 letters in length
(M = 6.08; SD = 1.6). Half of the target nouns were repetitions of nouns that had appeared at the end of the
preceding sentence and the other half were unrelated
to any word in the preceding sentence. The sentences
for repeated nouns following indefinite articles were
constructed such that the repeated noun always referred
to the noun in general terms, rather than a specific entity
(e.g. A sweater is the perfect completion to any winter
outfit.). Thus, these sentences were always sensible in
relation to the text. There were no anomalies within or
across sentences. The two-sentence texts were
between 13 and 36 words long (M = 27.12, SD = 4.1).
Across conditions, sentences were matched in length,
3 words.

Procedure
Participants first completed the ART, which took less than
two minutes. Next, participants were fitted with an EEG net
and completed the EEG portion of the experiment. Each
participant read 120 two-sentence texts, which were counterbalanced across participants using a Latin Square
design, such that all participants saw 30 items in each of
the four conditions. Participants saw the sentences in a
word-by-word presentation to reduce saccade artefacts.
Because the definite and indefinite articles are very short
compared with most words, stimulus onset asynchronies
(SOAs) varied with word length. Words that were three
letters or shorter had an SOA of 400 ms, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 200 ms. Words that were four
letters or longer had an SOA of 600 ms with an ISI of
300 ms. Finally, words at the end of the first sentence
had an SOA of 700 ms with an ISI of 400 ms to allow
extra time for sentence wrap-up effects.

Participants were instructed to read the two-sentence
texts for comprehension and answered true/false comprehension statements after half of the passages. Onehalf of the correct answers were true. After the EEG
recording session, participants completed the NelsonDenny vocabulary and comprehension assessments.

Apparatus, EEG recording, and pre-processing
EEG recordings used a 128 electrode Geodesic sensor net
(Tucker, 1993) containing Ag/AgCl electrodes and Net
Amps 400 amplifier (Electrical Geodesics 5.0, Inc.,
Eugene, OR). Participants sat in a soundproof and electrically shielded booth and EEG signals were collected using
Net Station Acquisition software. During the recording
session EEG impedances remained below 40 k (Ferree,
Phan, Gerald, & Tucker, 2001). Stimuli were presented on
a CRT monitor with a refresh rate of 60 Hz.
During the EEG recording session the vertex electrode
(Cz) served as the reference, with six electrodes around
the eyes to monitor eye movements. Continuous EEG
data were recorded at a rate of 1000 Hz and filtered
between 0.1 and 200 Hz. After the recording session,
EEG data were filtered through a low-pass finite
impulse filter of 30 Hz at 6 dB/octave and then segmented into 1100 ms epochs. Segments contained EEG data
for the nouns, including 100 ms before the critical noun
and 1000 ms after the critical noun.
The epochs were then run through an artefact detection tool using Net Station 5.0 software. A channel
removal threshold was set during a time window of
80 ms. Channels with amplitudes 200 V on over 20%
of trials were removed. Epochs for particular trials were
removed using the following criteria: if more than 12
channels were removed in the aforementioned step, if
amplitudes were 40 V (i.e. eye blinks), or if amplitudes
were 55 V (i.e. saccades). Five participants had less
than 60% of trials retained and their data were not
included in further analyses. An additional four participants could not be used due to technical issues and
two participants did not complete comprehension and/
or vocabulary assessments. Thus, a total of 52 participants were included in final analyses.
After the artefact rejection process, an average of 4.33
(SD = 1.66) electrode channels was removed and an
average of 27.20 (SD = 2.11) trials per condition were
retained. Data for removed channels were replaced
using spherical spline interpolation (Ferree, 2006).
Epochs were baseline corrected using a 100 ms prestimulus time period and subsequently re-referenced
using the average reference. Data were then exported
to EP Toolkit v2.49 (Dien, 2010), R v3.5.0 (R Core Team,
2018), and SPSS 25.0 for statistical analyses.

Results
True/false statement accuracy and individual
difference measures
Participants had an average accuracy of 91.72% (SD =
6.61%) for the true/false comprehension task during
EEG recording, with all participants scoring above 75%.
There were negligible differences among the four conditions, F(3, 150) = 2.00,  2 = .04, p = .119.
Descriptive statistics for the comprehension, vocabulary, and ART assessments (i.e. reading experience) are
in Table 2. Reading comprehension was correlated with
vocabulary (r = .68, p < .01). Reading experience was correlated modestly with vocabulary (r = .27, p < .01), but
not with reading comprehension (r = .08, p = .98). Due
to the correlation between vocabulary and reading comprehension, a composite z-score was computed as an
average of comprehension and vocabulary z-scores
(e.g. Stafura et al., 2015).

ERP analysis procedure
Using SPSS 25.0, we conducted separate planned
ANCOVAs on averaged data from 52 participants, selecting electrode clusters in the 10/20 system. For each ERP
time window, we conducted Midline (Fz, Cz, and Pz) and
Anteriority/Laterality analyses (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, and P4;
Figure 1). The Midline analyses included a 2 (Repetition:
Repeated vs. Non-repeated nouns) x 2 (Article: Definite
vs. Indefinite) x 3 (Electrode cluster: Fz vs. Cz vs. Pz)
repeated measures ANCOVA with Comprehension skill
as a covariate. The Anteriority/Laterality analyses
included a 2 (Repetition: Repeated vs. Non-repeated
nouns) x 2 (Article: Definite vs. Indefinite) x 3 (Anteriority:
Frontal (F3, F4) vs. Central (C3, C4) vs. Parietal (P3, P4)) x 2
(Laterality: Left (F3, C3, and P3) vs. Right (F4, C4, and P4))
ANCOVA with Comprehension skill as a covariate. The
N400 and LAN analyses included a 300-500 ms postnoun time window and the LPC analysis included a
500-700 ms post-noun time window.
For each time window, a main effect of repetition
would indicate processing differences between repeated
vs. non-repeated nouns, an article effect would suggest
article sensitivity in processing subsequent nouns, and
differences between repeated nouns following definite

vs. indefinite articles would differentiate co-referential
and lexical-semantic effects. An interaction with skill
would suggest that higher- and lower-skilled comprehenders are differentially sensitive to article cues and/
or repetition effects.
The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used when
sphericity assumptions were violated. Corrected pvalues are reported, and degrees of freedom are
reported with original values. All follow-up pairwise ttests for interactions that included electrode clusters
were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction.

300-500 ms time window results
Repeated nouns had a reduced negativity relative to
non-repeated nouns for both definite and indefinite
article conditions in the 300-500 ms time window, indicating an N400 effect (see Figure 2). These results are
confirmed by both Midline and Anteriority/Laterality
repeated measures ANCOVAs, summarised below and
presented in detail in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Both
analyses used the Repetition x Article x Electrode
cluster design described above, with Comprehension
skill as a covariate.
300-500 ms: midline analyses
At midline sites (Fz, Cz and Pz), there were significant
effects of Repetition, in which repeated nouns were
less negative than non-repeated nouns (Figure 2,
Table 3) and Electrode cluster, but no effect of Article.

indefinite articles (M = 1.29, SD = 1.91) were less negative
than nouns that followed definite articles (M = .52, SD =
1.66). The article effect was not significant at either the Cz

300-500 ms: anteriority/laterality analyses
The Repetition x Article x Anteriority x Laterality analysis
showed a main effect of Repetition, in which repeated
nouns were less negative than non-repeated nouns
(Table 4). There was no main effect of Article (Table 4),
but there were interactions of Article x Anteriority, Anteriority x Laterality, and Repetition x Article x Laterality.
All other interactions were not significant (ps > .160).
Figure 3 shows the topographical maps of effects.
A follow-up test of the Article x Anteriority interaction
shows article effects at Frontal (i.e. F3 and F4), t(207) =
3.28, p = .004, and Parietal electrode clusters (i.e. P3
and P4), t(207) = 3.38, p = .003. The article effect at
Central electrode clusters (i.e. C3 and C4) was marginal,
t(207) = 2.30, p = .067. At Frontal electrode clusters,
nouns that followed indefinite articles (M = 1.14, SD =
1.87) were less negative than nouns that followed
definite articles (M = .59, SD = 1.84). At Parietal electrode
clusters, nouns that followed definite articles (M = -.85,
SD = 1.34) were less negative than nouns that followed
indefinite articles (M = -1.22, SD = 1.45).
To further investigate the Repetition x Article x Laterality interaction, a 2 (Repetition) x 2 (Article) ANOVA
was conducted separately for Right and Left hemispheres. For the Right hemisphere (F4, C4, and P4),
there was a main effect of Repetition, F(1, 51) = 7.50,

 2 = .15, p = .009, in which repeated nouns were less
negative than non-repeated nouns. All other effects
were not significant (ps > .180). For the Left hemisphere
(F3, C3, and P3), neither Repetition nor Article were significant (ps > .124). The Repetition x Article interaction
was marginal, F(1, 51) = 3.12,  2 = .06, p = .083.
Overall, results indicate a general repetition effect:
Repeated nouns were less negative than non-repeated
nouns. This effect appeared to occur at midline (Cz and
Pz) and right lateralised electrode clusters. Article
effects at frontal sites indicated that nouns following
indefinite articles were less negative than nouns following definite articles, and this pattern reversed at right
and left lateralised parietal sites (Figure 3).

500-700 ms time window analysis
Similar to the 300-500 ms time-window analyses, we
carried out Midline (Fz, Cz and Pz) and Anteriority/Laterality (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, and P4) ANCOVAs in the 500-
700 ms time window (Tables 5 and 6, respectively). Comprehension skill served as a covariate. Results revealed a
repetition effect that appears to be an extension of the
N400 effect at a central site, in which repeated nouns
were less negative than non-repeated nouns after both
definite and indefinite articles. Effects of word repetition
depended on the preceding article in this time window

Figure 3. Topographical map of ERP effects 300-500 ms after noun onset. Repetition effect: For nouns following both definite and
indefinite articles, repeated nouns were less negative than non-repeated nouns. Article effects: At frontal sites, nouns following indefinite articles were less negative than nouns following definite articles; at parietal sites nouns following definite articles were less negative than nouns following indefinite articles.

(Figure 4). These results were confirmed in the ANCOVAs
summarised below.

500-700 ms: midline analysis
At midline sites, a 2(Repetition) x 2(Electrode cluster)
analysis with Comprehension skill as a covariate showed
main effects of Repetition, in which non-repeated nouns
were more positive than repeated nouns, and of Electrode
cluster, but no main effect of Article (Table 5). The Repetition x Electrode cluster and Article x Electrode cluster
interactions were significant. There was a marginal
Repetition x Article x Comprehension skill interaction. All

other interactions with Comprehension skill were not significant (ps > .308).
As a follow-up of the Repetition x Electrode cluster
interaction, a pairwise t-test showed that non-repeated
nouns were more positive than repeated nouns, at the
Cz electrode cluster, t(103) = 2.61, p = .031, but not the
Fz or Pz electrode clusters (ps > .100). A follow-up pairwise t-test of the Article x Electrode cluster interaction
revealed that at the Fz electrode cluster, nouns that followed indefinite articles (M = 2.79, SD = 2.23) were
more positive than articles that followed definite
articles (M = 1.94, SD = 1.87), t(103) = 3.16, p = .006. This

Figure 4. Topographical map of ERP effects 500-700 ms after noun onset. Repetition effect: For nouns following both definite and
indefinite articles, repeated nouns were more positive than non-repeated nouns at central sites. In the anteriority/laterality analysis,
non-repeated nouns were more positive than repeated nouns only when they followed definite articles; visually, this repetition
effect was more frontal, although there was no interaction with anteriority. Article effect: Nouns following definite articles were
more positive than nouns following indefinite articles and this effect appears largest at central parietal sites, although at a frontal electrode cluster (Fz) nouns following indefinite articles were more positive than nouns following definite articles.

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

effect was not present at Cz or Pz electrode clusters
(ps > .093).

500-700 ms: anteriority/laterality analysis
The Anteriority/Laterality analysis showed a non-significant Repetition effect and no effect of Article (Table 6).
Interactions of Article x Anteriority, Repetition x Article,
and Anteriority x Laterality were significant as was the
three-way interaction of Repetition x Anteriority x Laterality interaction. All other interactions were not significant (ps > .123).
A pairwise t-test that followed-up the Article x Anteriority interaction showed an article effect at parietal
electrode clusters (i.e. P3 and P4): Nouns that followed
definite articles (M = -1.12, SD = 1.57) were more positive than nouns that followed indefinite articles (M =
-1.60, SD = 1.78), t(207) = 3.79, p < .001. Article effects
were not significant at Frontal (F3 and F4) or Central
sites (C3 and C4; ps > .116).
Follow-up pairwise t-tests of the Repetition x Article
interaction showed that, for nouns that followed
definite articles, non-repeated nouns (M = .40, SD =
2.31) were more positive than repeated nouns (M = .15,
SD = 1.97), t(311) = 2.00, p = .046. This effect was not significant for repeated vs. non-repeated nouns that followed indefinite articles, t(311) = 1.14, p = .257. Followup tests of the Repetition x Anteriority x Laterality interaction did not show repetition effects at individual electrode clusters (ps > .582).
In summary, an extended noun repetition effect at the
Cz electrode cluster emerged in the 500-700 ms time
window. In addition, an article effect emerged at parietal
sites (i.e. P3 and P4), as in the in 300-500 ms time
window. Nouns that followed definite articles were
more positive than nouns that followed indefinite
articles. Finally, an interaction of article type with noun
repetition appeared during this late time window in
the Anteriority/Laterality analysis. Non-repeated nouns
showed a greater positivity than repeated nouns specifically after definite articles.

Discussion
Our study aimed to distinguish among the lexical-semantic, co-referential integrative, and structure building processes that occur during text reading across a sentence
boundary. The results showed typical N400 word repetition effects in the 300-500 ms time window and
these effects were not influenced by comprehension
skill. During this time window, whether the article was
the definite (the) or indefinite form (a) affected the
N400 on the following noun at frontal and parietal
sites. Furthermore, the overall N400 noun repetition

133

effect extended into the LPC time window at a central
site. Greater positivity for nouns following definite compared to indefinite articles in the LPC time window
suggests a distinction between co-referential integration
(signalled by definite articles) and structure building (signalled by indefinite articles). Finally, repetition effects in
the LPC time window occurred only for nouns that followed definite articles, suggesting differences involved
in effort related to integrative processes. Comprehension
skill did not influence any of these effects, consistent
with the assumption that the use of articles as cues to
structure building is well established among collegelevel readers. We first review early effects of lexicalsemantic processes and working memory demands followed by later LPC effects that indicate co-referential
and model updating processes.

N400 Lexical-semantic effects
Our results align with previous research finding similar
N400 word repetition effects at centro-parietal sites
(e.g. Anderson & Holcomb, 2005). Centro-parietal electrodes showed a reduced N400 negativity for repeated
nouns compared to non-repeated nouns that was independent of definiteness of the preceding article. This
result is consistent with a generalised congruence
interpretation of right-lateralised N400 effects, encompassing both meaning and word-form congruence (for
a review see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas & Hillyard,
1980; Metusalem et al., 2012; Perfetti, Yang, & Schmalhofer, 2008). One interpretation of these effects is that the
reduced N400 negativity resulting from repetition
reflects ease of lexical access, a result of mere word repetition, rather than integrative processes. However, true
lexical-semantic integration is a plausible interpretation
because repeated and similar-meaning words can
produce similar N400s in this paradigm (Yang et al.,
2007). In the 500-700 ms time window at a central electrode cluster (i.e. Cz), there was an extended repetition
effect in which repeated nouns were more positive
than non-repeated nouns, which is consistent with the
old/new effect (Rugg & Curran, 2007).

N400 integration effects
If the general N400 noun repetition effects reflect a
lexical-semantic process, then integration processes
can be seen in the effect of the article on the N400 of
the following noun. We observed such an effect at lateralised parietal sites (e.g. P3 and P4): Nouns that followed
definite articles were less negative than nouns that followed indefinite articles. Because the article effect was
general across repeated and non-repeated nouns, it

134

R. C. CALLOWAY AND C. A. PERFETTI

suggests a distinction between an integrative process
(triggered by the) and a structure building process (triggered by a/an). Following the definite article, a noun,
often but not always, will be integrable (Calloway & Perfetti, 2017), i.e. co-referential with elements in the
reader's text memory. (The definite article can be followed by a non-coreferential noun, so coreferentiality
is statistically based.) Following the indefinite article,
the noun will not be co-referential, introducing new
information (Gernsbacher, 1997; Gernsbacher & Robertson, 2001; Haviland & Clark, 1974).

Anterior article effects
Similar to Anderson and Holcomb (2005), we found an
anterior negativity in the 300-500 ms time window. The
negativity was greater for nouns following definite articles
compared with nouns following indefinite articles. In
Anderson and Holcomb's study, repeated words and
synonyms that followed definite articles were more negative compared with the same words that followed indefinite articles at left lateralised frontal and temporal sites.
Although our results partly align with those of Anderson
and Holcomb (2005), our effects were broadly distributed
across frontal sites, most visible in central and right clusters, rather than left lateralised. Nouns that followed
definite articles were more negative than nouns that followed indefinite articles.
Anderson and Holcomb (2005) interpreted their left
lateralised effect as an LAN, usually associated with syntactic processes, as reflecting working memory
demands. Such demands could be greater if the definite
article cues the reader that upcoming information will
be related to information in memory. Whether the negativity we observed has this same interpretation is not
clear. For one thing, as can be seen in Figure 3, the
present anterior negativity is most visible at central and
right electrode sites, not left. For another, the memory
demands imposed appear to be minimal compared with
those sin the research demonstrating memory-based
effects. An alternative explanation for a reduced negativity
for nouns following indefinite compared with definite
articles is that a definite article prompts an attempt to
establish co-reference when the noun is read. This
process then continues into the LPC time window,
further differentiating structure building from co-referential processes involved in model updating.

Model updating and structure building reflected
in late positivities
In the 500-700 ms time window, we found a parietal LPC
effect in which nouns that followed definite articles were

more positive than nouns that followed indefinite
articles. This result is consistent with the interpretation
that an LPC can reflect mental model updating (Burkhardt, 2007; Helder et al., 2019; Schumacher & Hung,
2012) and adds evidence that the definite article
prompts updating through a co-referential integration
process. The indefinite article, in contrast, provides no
signal for co-referential integration, instead prompting
a new discourse entity.
Late positivities in the 500-700 ms time window were
also found in anterior electrodes; however, here we see a
dependence between article type and noun repetition.
Following a definite article, a greater positivity occurred
on a new (non-repeated) noun compared to a repeated
noun. No such difference occurred following an indefinite article. This suggests again that the definite article
signalled co-referential integration, and when it was followed by a new noun this prompted a memory retrieval
for an antecedent. This suggestion appears to be consistent with the updating account of the LPC effect proposed by Burkhardt (2007); the late positivity reflects
an effort in model updating and this effort is greater
(and unsuccessful) for a new noun following a definite
article. The LPC effect also seems consistent with one
of the results of Helder et al. (2019), who found that sentence-final words unrelated to the central theme of a
four-sentence text received a larger positivity than sentence-final words related to the text's central theme.
Because the present LPC effect was not found for indefinite articles, it seems to distinguish co-referential processes associated with model updating, indicated by a
presence of a definite article, from lexical-semantic
processes.

Conclusions
Overall, our results suggest a time-course and topographic distribution of lexical-semantic, co-referential
integration, and structure building processes. First, a
right-lateralised central-parietal N400 repetition effect
occurred across a sentence boundary, distinguishing
repeated from non-repeated nouns. Because this repetition effect did not depend on the preceding article,
it suggests lexical-semantic processes that facilitate processing of a repeated word, rather than co-referential
processes. Second, at frontal sites, a decreased negativity
for nouns following indefinite articles compared to
definite articles suggests co-referential processes triggered by definite articles, thus distinguishing co-referential processes from lexical-semantic integration and
structure building. Third, at a later stage (500-700 ms),
the LPC effect reflects continued updating processes following definite articles, but not indefinite articles.

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

Furthermore, these effects were larger for non-repeated
nouns than repeated nouns after definite articles, but not
indefinite articles, suggesting that the updating process
was initiated by the co-referential processes cued by
the definite article.
