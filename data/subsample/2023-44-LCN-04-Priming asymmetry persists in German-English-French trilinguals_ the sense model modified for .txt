ABSTRACT

The present study examined within - and cross-language priming patterns among GermanEnglish-French trilinguals in order to explore the lexico-semantic representation of L3 in relation
to L1 and L2. The trilinguals participated in three lexical decision tasks within the masked
translation priming paradigm. The results showed significant within-language repetition priming
effects in all three languages, significant translation priming effects for L2-L1, L1-L3, and L2-L3,
but no significant priming for L1-L2, L3-L1 or L3-L2. Our findings demonstrate that translation
priming asymmetry persists in trilinguals and that the weakest L3 is integrated into both L1 and
L2 conceptually (i.e. three languages have a commonly shared conceptual representation). In
addition, our results showed a language dominance shift over lexical development between L1
and L2. We argue for a modified Sense Model as the best fit to explain the cognitive
architecture of the trilingual lexicon.

1. Introduction
In many parts of Europe, children are required to learn
two foreign languages at school (e.g. Germany, Greece,
Austria, etc.) and being functional in three languages is
common. According to a report (Eurobarometer, 2012),
roughly 28% of European citizens are trilingual. Given
the rising globalisation and immigration across the
world, psycholinguists and cognitive scientists have generated a large number of papers in multilingualism over
recent decades, starting from the most straightforward
form, namely, bilingualism. One of the central questions
in bilingualism is how lexico-semantic organisation in
bilingual memory works in relation to both linguistic
systems (de Groot, 1995; Finkbeiner et al., 2004;
Francis, 1999, 2005), which is a question that can then
be extended to the case of three linguistic systems.
Most current theories of the bilingual lexicon hold the
view that the two languages are integrated at the conceptual/semantic level (e.g. the Sense Model of Finkbeiner et al., 2004; the Bilingual Interactive Activation
Model, BIA, of Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002). Empirical
evidence from cross-language masked priming studies
supports this claim, consistently demonstrating that
words in one language can trigger the activation of
the other language due to their shared orthography

For the purpose of advancing current psycholinguistic
models in multilingualism, we attempt in the current
study to address the question of lexico-semantic organisation in trilinguals (i.e. whether/how three languages are
integrated at the semantic level), as it is still unknown
whether the same type of lexico-semantic integration in
bilinguals (i.e. shared conceptual representations) can be
applied to speakers of three different languages and
whether L1, L2 and L3 have shared or separate conceptual
representations. The task that is adopted is masked
priming (Forster & Davis, 1984) which has been widely
used to investigate lexical access and retrieval in bilingual
language processing to understand the organisation and
functionality of the bilingual mental lexicon (Wang et al.,
2021; Wang & Forster, 2010, 2014). In this paradigm,
prior to the presentation of targets, primes are presented
for a duration of 50-60 ms following a 500 ms forward

mask and have been shown to be processed by participants at a subconscious level (Dehaene et al., 2001). By
manipulating the relationship between primes and
targets and observing potential priming effects, researchers have been able to infer how linguistic information is
organised in the mental lexicon.

1.1. Priming asymmetry and task dependent
effect in bilinguals
In bilingual studies of non-cognate translation equivalents, cross-language masked priming effects have
been taken as evidence to support an integrated bilingual lexicon at the semantic level, in particular, in the
case of translation equivalents that use distinct orthographies (e.g. Chinese-English) as it is unlikely that
cross-language priming effects are driven by shared
orthographic or phonological representations and
must be due to the shared conceptual representations
(e.g. Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002; Finkbeiner et al.,
2004). In addition, masked translation priming studies
of bilinguals have found asymmetric priming effects:
priming from the first language (L1) to the second
language (L2), but not always in the other direction
(e.g. Gollan et al., 1997; Jiang, 1999; Sachez-Casas et al.,
1992; Wang, 2013). There are two views to explain this
cross-language priming asymmetry.
The first is the proficiency account which argues that
the absence of L2-L1 priming is due to low L2 proficiency
and L2 is therefore not strong enough to be activated
when it is the briefly presented prime. Two models are
in line with this account. The Revised Hierarchical
Model (RHM: Kroll et al., 2010) argues for no L2 formmeaning connections and the use of L2-L1 lexical links
in L2 processing at the early stage of L2 development.
As L2 proficiency increases, L2 form-meaning connections will develop and become stronger. The Bilingual
Interactive Activation/Bilingual Interactive Activation
Plus (BIA/BIA+) Models (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002;
van Heuven et al., 1998) are computational models, specifying that low L2 proficiency is associated with a higher
activation threshold compared to L1 and thus predicting
that L2 will be more difficult to activate. Both models
predict that translation priming depends on the activation strength of L1 relative to L2. In this view, increasing L2 proficiency increases L2 activation strength
relative to L1 to produce L2-L1 priming. With sufficient
L2 proficiency, priming will be observed from L2 to L1
as has been demonstrated in a few studies where L2-L1
priming is nevertheless still weaker than L1-L2 priming
(e.g. Dunabeitia et al., 2010; Nakayama et al., 2016).
However, these two models are inadequate in explaining two sets of results where L2 has been shown to be an

effective prime: within-L2 repetition priming with no concomitant L2-L1 priming (Gollan et al., 1997; Jiang, 1999)
and task-dependent L2-L1 priming (Finkbeiner et al.,
2004; Wang, 2014; Wang & Forster, 2010). First, if L2
masked primes are not effectively processed due to
weak activation in L2-L1, how can L2 primes be activated
and effectively processed when the targets are also in L2?
Within-L2 repetition priming is quite robust and cannot be
simply driven by the form-level overlap, or else we would
run into problems explaining cognate priming. That is, L2L1 translation priming effects with cognates (e.g. ricoRICH) are stronger than a baseline involving a similar
degree of form overlap (e.g. rict-RICH), as shown by
Sachez-Casas et al. (1992). Thus, cognate priming must
be attributed to an overlap of information at the semantic
level. Following a similar logic, the loci of priming effects
when the prime and target fully overlap in both form
and meaning (i.e. within-L2 repetition priming) are very
likely to be at both the orthographic and semantic
levels. Second, priming asymmetry is task-dependent
and the absent L2-L1 priming in lexical decision
emerges in semantic categorisation, which means that
L2 is strong enough to elicit priming in at least some circumstances (Finkbeiner et al., 2004; Grainger & FrenckMestre, 1998; Wang, 2014; Wang & Forster, 2010). If bilinguals are proficient enough to produce within-L2 priming
in lexical decision and L2-L1 priming in semantic categorisation, why are they not proficient enough to produce L2L1 priming in lexical decision? In other words, why is proficiency relevant only to lexical decision?
The second explanation for asymmetric priming and
its task-dependence is offered by the Sense Model (SM:
Finkbeiner et al., 2004), which proposes that translation
priming depends on the degree of overlap in the
senses associated with the prime and target, and that a
semantic categorisation task accentuates this overlap.
Here, a sense refers to the meaning of a word used in a
particular context. The SM starts with the assumption
that most words are polysemous and that the range of
senses that a word has differs across languages. Translation equivalents share one sense (typically, the dominant sense), but may differ in their remaining senses.
For example, the English word black and the Chinese
word  are translation equivalents, having the core
sense in common (i.e. "a colour"). However, in English
black can also be used to refer to a type of humour or
a calamitous day on the stock market, while in Chinese,
 can refer to those who are evil-minded or something
that is secret. Thus, the senses of L1 and L2 words can
extend well beyond the shared semantic sense that
determines translation equivalence. Since bilinguals are
normally more proficient and dominant in their L1 than
L2, it follows that an L2 speaker would likely know

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

fewer senses of L2 words compared with L1. This would
result in a representational asymmetry between L1 and
L2 at the semantic level.
Following the SM, translation priming depends not
only on the overlap in the semantic senses activated by
the prime and the target, but on the ratio of primed to
unprimed senses associated with the target. The representational asymmetry indicates that most, if not all L2
senses are associated with L1, but not vice versa. In
order to produce priming, it is necessary to activate a
sufficient proportion of the target senses. Priming from
L1 to L2 occurs because the L1 prime can activate a high
proportion of the L2 target senses. However, priming
from L2 to L1 is weaker because the L2 prime might activate only the dominant sense of the L1 target, and hence
the ratio of primed to unprimed senses associated with
the L1 target will be rather low, compared to that in the
L1-L2 direction. This results in the absence of L2-L1
priming, as often reported in the previous studies using
the lexical decision task. In the semantic categorisation
task, however, the category is assumed to act as a kind
of filter that limits activation to just the category-relevant
features of the target, thereby increasing the ratio of the
primed senses to the unprimed senses in the case of L2L1 priming. Of course, a similar task-dependent effect
would not be expected in the L1-L2 direction because
all the L2 senses would be activated by the L1 prime in
any case (Wang & Forster, 2010).
Most current bilingual models (e.g. the BIA/BIA+, the
RHM, etc.) assume language non-selectivity and that the
two languages of a bilingual share a common semantic
system (at least for translation equivalents), without specifying the lexico-semantic architecture of the bilingual lexicon.
The SM is the only theory that articulates the mechanism of
cross-language processing as a consequence of asymmetrically represented semantic senses. In other words, bilingual
models which propose limiting factors such as weaker L2
form-meaning connection strengths (e.g. the RHM) or
higher L2 activation threshold (e.g. the BIA+) simply
account for differences in L2 lexical access in terms of
lower L2 proficiency, but fail to explain the empirical
findings, such as within-L2 repetition priming, and the
task-dependent effect discussed earlier. Thus, we argue
for the SM as a more explanatory theoretical framework
to understand the nature of bilingual/multilingual
language processing and representations. We further
develop this theory to understand whether and how such
a mechanism could apply to the trilingual lexicon.

1.2. The trilingual lexicon
The bilingual literature brings to light at least two key
issues that need to be addressed in L3 research: the

985

path of lexical access and the dynamic nature of conceptual restructuring (i.e. lexico-semantic integration across
the three languages). One way to address these questions is to understand how L3 lexical processing
behaves in relation to L1 or L2 processing by comparing
priming patterns between different language pairs. So
far, the priming paradigm has provided very limited
empirical evidence to explain the organisation of the trilingual mental lexicon and it is unknown whether the
same kind of semantic integration across languages in
bilinguals also applies to trilinguals.
One major challenge in addressing this question is
the difficulty of finding a homogeneous participant
group when there are so many variables associated
with L3 acquisition in relation to L1 and L2 (e.g. language
proficiency, AoA, language dominance, etc.). The limited
number of investigations on the trilingual lexicon vary
greatly in terms of the language combinations, relative
proficiency levels of each language, and the tasks
implemented. A review of the literature indicates that
L1 and L2 have consistently shown shared conceptual
representations in trilinguals (Abunuwara, 1992; Aparicio
& Lavaur, 2016; De Groot & Hoeks, 1995; Francis &
Gallard, 2005; Lemhofer et al., 2004; Tytus, 2017).
However, the empirical findings differ from each other
in terms of how L3 is related to L1 and L2. Some
studies have suggested that L3 is separate from L1 and
L2 at the conceptual level as no priming of L3 was
observed when either L1 or L2 was the prime, and
neither was priming of L1 or L2 observed when L3 was
the prime (e.g. Abunuwara, 1992; Aparicio & Lavaur,
2016; De Groot & Hoeks, 1995; Tytus, 2017).
However, others have shown significant crosslanguage effects in both directions involving L3.
Francis and Gallard (2005) showed repetition priming
effects in all cross-language directions in a word translation task in English-Spanish-French trilinguals, using
a study-test paradigm. That is, for any triplet of words
meaning the same thing that were repeated either
during the comprehension processes in word translation
or during the production processes in word translation,
significant repetition priming effects were observed
across study and test phases for old repeated items compared to new items. For example, apple was facilitated in
a French-English translation at test (generating apple
from pomme) if it had been previously translated in
the study phase from Spanish to English (generating
apple from manzana) or even when translation was
from French to Spanish (generating manzana from
pomme), relative to a word that did not occur in the
study phase. In this paradigm, the repetition priming
effect depends on the shared properties between cognitive processes at study and test, and the expected

986

magnitude of priming derived from repeated word
forms (i.e. repeated orthography in comprehension
and repeated phonology in production) is about 30 ms
(see, e.g. Durso & Johnson, 1979). Because a magnitude
of more than 200 ms repetition priming was observed in
word translation in all language directions, the authors
argued that facilitation is not simply due to the shared
processes based on word forms and that translation is
conceptually mediated across all three languages.
Facilitatory effects in L3 were also shown by Lemhofer
et al. (2004) in lexical decision responses to L3 German
words for Dutch-English-German trilinguals. Both
"double" Dutch-German cognates that are not cognates
to English (e.g. KUNST, "art" in both Dutch and German)
and "triple" English-Dutch-German cognates that
overlap in orthography and meaning in all three
languages (e.g. ECHO) were responded to more quickly
than non-cognates. In addition, triple cognates were
responded to more quickly than double cognates.
Thus, these results show that lexical access to L3 was
affected by both L1 and L2 via form-level processing
(i.e. shared orthography), even though they do not
inform us whether L3 has a shared conceptual representation with L1 and/or L2 for non-cognates.
Arguably, neither word translation nor lexical
decision can directly test the inter-lingual connection
between non-cognate translation equivalents in the
way that the masked priming paradigm does in order
to reduce strategic effects to the minimum (Forster
et al., 2003). That is, in word translation or lexical
decision with cognates, participants might think that
their three languages are meant to be involved in the
experiment and, therefore, operate in a trilingual mode
(Grosjean, 2001).
Two recent studies have adopted the masked priming
paradigm to investigate the lexico-semantic organisation
of the trilingual lexicon. Aparicio and Lavaur (2016) examined masked translation priming with non-cognate translation equivalents among unbalanced French-EnglishSpanish trilinguals, with low proficiency in L2 and L3.
The results showed significant within-L2 and L3 repetition priming and both L1-L2 and L1-L3 translation
priming, but no L2-L3 nor L3-L2 priming. The authors
concluded that only the dominant L1 produced translation priming effects and attributed this to there being
no conceptual link between L2 and L3, with lexical
access in both L2 and L3 being mediated by L1. The
within-language repetition priming, and priming asymmetry are consistent with the cross-language priming literature in bilinguals, as discussed above. However, the
failure to observe priming between L2 and L3 is puzzling.
If L1-L2 and L1-L3 priming effects are driven by translation equivalence in non-cognates, L2 and L3 must

share semantic representations given that both are
semantically integrated with L1. It should also be noted
that L1 was not tested as targets in this study, so there
is no actual confirmation that translation priming is not
observed for the dominant language (L1) in this experiment (i.e. L2-L1 and L3-L1).
In addition, Tytus (2017) investigated cross-language
priming with non-cognate translation equivalents in an
animacy categorisation task for German-English-French
trilinguals, observing both L1-L2 and L2-L1 priming.
Such a result is consistent with previous findings with
bilinguals showing that L2-L1 priming is found in semantic categorisation, in contrast to lexical decision (e.g.
Finkbeiner et al., 2004; Grainger & Frenck-Mestre, 1998;
Wang & Forster, 2010). However, the study found no
reliable priming in L3, as either the prime or the target,
which is hard to explain given that the categorisation
task forces conceptual or lexical access.
To address the question of whether and how L3 is
conceptually integrated with L1 and L2 in the trilingual
mental lexicon, we need to overcome the methodological weaknesses of the previous studies to rigorously test
cross-language priming in trilinguals. First, in our design,
we tested both masked repetition and translation
priming in lexical decision in all three languages and
all cross-language directions in order to capture a complete picture of cross-language priming patterns. Repetition priming where the prime and target are
identical provides a comparison with translation
priming and serves as an indicator of whether primes
are processed effectively in the masked condition
(Midgley et al., 2009).
Second, we recruited a homogeneous group of
German-English-French trilinguals living in the UK. That
is, in our sample, we ensured that their order of
language acquisition was the same, L1 German as
native, L2 English with high proficiency and L3 French
with low proficiency (see the self-rating scores in
Section 2.1). Given the considerable constraints on the
participants' linguistic profiles, however, we were only
able to test a small sample, which was therefore compensated by adopting a repeated testing paradigm.
This procedure allows a small group of participants to
be tested repeatedly with the same materials over the
course of a few sessions. The repetition lies in the
targets, not the primes, as participants are tested on
the same targets in different counterbalanced lists. In
other words, the primes in each list are different and
are below the awareness of the participants such that
repeated testing with masked primes gets around the
problem of subjects learning how to respond after multiple presentations. The benefit of this research technique is that more stable data are able to be retrieved

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

from a small number of participants that belong to a rare
group, such as German-English-French trilinguals living
in the UK. This procedure has been shown to provide
results in masked priming that are not only consistent
with those of single session experiments but are far
more sensitive to small effects (Byrne & Yelland, 2004;
Frost et al., 2003; Jacobs et al., 1995; Witzel et al., 2011).

2. The present study
In the present study, we are interested in identifying
what the cross-language priming patterns are between
L1, L2, and L3 and understanding the mental representation of L3 in relation to L1 and L2 at the conceptual
level. German-English-French trilinguals were asked to
complete three lexical decision experiments within the
masked translation priming paradigm. The target
language was either L1, L2 or L3 and all were primed
by L1, L2 or L3. Experiment 1 tested L1-German as the
target language in four different prime conditions: repetition (L1-L1), L2 translation (L2-L1), L3 translation (L3L1), as well as a control/unrelated prime in L1 (i.e. the
baseline condition). Experiment 2 similarly investigated
these cross-language priming effects on L2 English
targets with four different prime types: repetition (L2L2), L1 translation (L1-L2), L3 translation (L3-L2), and a
control/unrelated prime in L2. Finally, Experiment 3
used L3 French targets: L3-L3, L1-L3, L2-L3, and a
control/unrelated prime in L3.

2.1. Participants
The participants included eight individuals, 18 years of
age and above (M = 22.3, SD = 2.6), who were speakers
of L1 German, L2 English, and L3 French. All of them
acquired German as their native language, English as
their second language (M of Age of Acquisition = 8.13,
SD = 4.01) and French as their third language (M of
AoA = 12.13, SD = 2.1). Thus, the order of acquisition
was controlled. The participants were recruited from a
local British university community and were compensated for their participation. At the time of testing, all
had been living in the UK either for work or study for
an extensive period and had learned French in German
public schools without using it for some years.
In a language history questionnaire, the participants
were asked to rate their proficiency in terms of speaking,
reading, writing, and listening in the three languages on
a scale of 1-7 where 1 = high proficiency and 7 = low
proficiency. These ratings are shown in Table 1.
Paired-samples t-tests (n = 12) were conducted to
compare mean scores of self-ratings in all the four
language skills of the three languages. German was

rated as being significantly more proficient than
English in listening, t (7) = 2.36, p = .01, but not in the
other skills. There were significant differences in all
skills between L1 (German) and L3 (French), as well as
between L2 (English) and L3, all p's < .01. Therefore,
these trilinguals were highly proficient in both L1German and L2-English and had a relatively low level
of L3-French proficiency based on their self-ratings.

2.2. Materials and design
A list of 160 translation triads was developed from which
target words were selected for each of the three experiments. Words presented as targets in the study were
chosen to be of high lexical frequency to ensure that
participants would be able to identify the French
words despite their generally low proficiency in L3. We
also ensured that frequency of the translations of the
selected words were comparably high based on the
available databases (Dave, 2012; Davies, 2010; New,
2006). Non-cognate translation equivalents were
selected by avoiding major orthographic overlap
within any triad. Interlingual homographs were also
avoided. Two language consultants fluent in all three
languages confirmed the translation equivalency of
each triad. See the stimuli in the Appendix.
Four counterbalanced lists were created for each
experiment so that all word targets were presented
with all different prime types (L1, L2, L3, and control).
This resulted in 12 lists in total, each consisting of 320
targets, including 160 words and 160 nonwords. Due
to the difficulty in recruiting a group of trilinguals with
a homogeneous language learning background, a
repeated testing paradigm was used (see also Witzel
et al., 2011).
Each participant completed 12 lists in four different
sessions and each session tested one of the four lists
of each target language. Thus, three lists (one for each
language) were tested per session. Each session per

988

participant took place on different days. Each target
word was presented with a different prime type in
each list and was thus tested across four different conditions. Among the 160 word targets in each language,
40 control prime words, along with a set of nonword
targets, were selected from WordGen (Duyck et al.,
2004), such that the nonwords were legal pronounceable letter-strings in the language relevant to the particular experiment. The control primes were unrelated
words in the target language, matched with other
prime words in both length and frequency. For
example, the control primes were unrelated German
words if the target language was German. Examples of
prime-target pairings for all conditions are presented
in Table 2. Stimuli were presented in four blocks for
each list, each block consisting of 40 words and 40 nonwords. Targets and blocks were randomly presented.

2.3. Procedure
Participants completed all three experiments (i.e.
German, English and French) in the counterbalanced
order. Stimuli were presented using DMDX (Forster &
Forster, 2003). Participants were presented with strings
of letters and asked to decide whether these strings
were real words or not in the specified language, by
pressing "yes" or "no" buttons in front of a computer
screen. For each trial, consistent with the standard
"three-field" masking procedure of Forster and Davis
(1984), a forward mask (########) was presented for
500 ms, followed by a brief prime in lowercase letters
for 50 ms, and then a target in uppercase letters for
500 ms. Thus, a trial looked as follows: #####-primeTARGET. There were short breaks allowed between
experiments.
Prior to the first session of testing, participants also
completed the language questionnaire on their proficiency level and language learning experiences in
German, English, and French.

3. Results
None of the participants made more than 20% errors in
any of their three languages and all were included in the
data analysis which was based solely on the word trials.

In cases where Reaction Times were shorter than 200 ms
or longer than 2000ms, the data were discarded. The
priming effect was calculated by subtracting the mean
RT for a given condition from the mean RT for the
target language's unrelated condition. The RT data
were log-transformed and analysed using linear mixedeffects modelling with the afex package (Singmann
et al., 2016) to perform mixed model analyses1 and the
emmeans package (Baayen et al., 2008; Lenth et al.,
2018) for post-hoc analyses in the R environment (R
Core Team, 2014, version 3.1.3) and Rstudio. All the datasets and R codes are available at Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/8m4bn/).

3.1. Experiment 1: German (L1) as the target
language
Unlike more traditional ANOVAs, mixed-effects models
take raw unaveraged data as input and incorporate
both random effects of participants and items within a
single analysis. In addition, we employed maximal
random-effect structures in the models and included
random slopes for factors of repeated measures to
avoid Type I errors (Barr et al., 2013). Because we used
a repeated testing paradigm, it is in our interest to investigate whether "repetition" across sessions would affect
the priming patterns. Thus, the fixed-effect factors were
language direction (L1-L1 vs. L2-L1 vs. L3-L1 vs. baseline)
and session (4 levels). Participants and items were
random factors. To set up each model, we started from
the maximal model which is justified by the design
and then simplified it in case of convergence errors
(Matuschek et al., 2017). We performed a stepwise simplification on an overparameterized model by removing
the correlation parameter, higher-order interactions, and
random effect terms with least variance to address the
convergence error (Singmann & Kellen, 2019). All posthoc analyses, performed using the emmeans package,
were corrected for multiple comparisons using the
Holm-Bonferroni adjustment. Following standard conventions, any p-value smaller than .05 was deemed
significant.

by-participants random slope for session, by-item
random intercept, and by-item random slope for
session. This model showed a main effect of language
direction: F (3, 4673. 19) = 80.53, p < .001, but neither a
main effect of session, F (3, 11.28) = 0.67, p = .588, nor
an interaction between language direction and session,
F (9, 552.46) = .98, p = .453. Further pairwise contrast
analyses showed significant L1-L1 repetition priming
(40 ms), z = 12.97, p < .0001, and significant L2-L1 translation priming (15 ms), z = 4.37, p < .0001. However, L3L1 translation priming was not significant, z = 0.9, p
= .368. In addition, L1-L1 repetition priming was significantly stronger than L2-L1 translation priming, z = 8.62,
p < .0001, and L2-L1 translation priming was significantly
stronger than L3-L1 priming, z = 5.26, p < .0001. See
Table 4 for the results of pairwise contrasts. The same
pattern of priming effects was observed in each session.
Error Analysis. As error rates are not the main predictor of priming studies, we only ran a random-intercept
model. The overall analysis of error rates only showed
a main effect of language direction, X2 (3) = 16.16, p
= .001. There was neither a main effect of session, X2
(3) = 2.23, p = .527, nor an interaction between language
direction and session, X2 (9) = 11.11, p = .268. Further pairwise contrast analyses showed significant differences
between the L1-L1 repetition priming and the L3-L1
translation priming conditions, z = 3.78, p = .001, as
well as between the L1-L1 repetition priming and the
unrelated conditions, z = 3.25, p = .006. That is, the L1L1 condition generated fewer errors than the L3-L1
and baseline conditions.

model analyses showed a main effect of language direction, F (3, 4702.24) = 99.46, p < .001, as well as a main
effect of session, F (3, 4702.28) = 8.18, p < .001. The interaction between language direction and session was not
significant, F (9, 597.83) = .63, p = .769. Further pairwise
contrast analyses showed significant L2-L2 repetition
priming (44 ms), z = 13.63, p < .0001, but the 5 m L1-L2
facilitation was not significant, z = 1.48, p = 0.14, and
neither was the 7 ms L3-L2 inhibition, z = 1.94, p = .11.
See Table 6 for the results of pairwise contrasts. The
same pattern of priming effects was observed in each
session.
Error Analysis. The overall analysis of error rates only
showed a main effect of language direction, X2 (3) =

session, X2 (3) = 3.87, p = .276, nor an interaction
between language direction and session, X2 (9) = 11.08,
p = .27. Further pairwise contrast analyses showed significant differences between the L2-L2 condition and
each of the other conditions: z = 3.006, p = .011; z = 4.9,
p < .0001; z = 4.085, p = .0002, for the comparison with
the L1-L2, L3-L2, and baseline conditions respectively.

direction and session was not significant, F (9, 525.94)

z = 7.73, p < .0001, and L2-L3 priming, z = 6.83, p
< .0001; while the difference between L1-L3 and L2-L3
priming was not significant, z = 0.886, p = .376. See
Table 8 for the results of pair-wise contrasts.
Error Analysis. The overall analysis of error rates only
showed a main effect of language direction, X2 (3) =
19.70, p < .001. There was neither a main effect of
session, X2 (3) = 4.08, p = .253, nor an interaction
between language direction and session, X2 (9) = 5.55, p

= .002; z = 4.015, p = .0004, for the comparison with the
L1-L3, L2-L3 and baseline conditions respectively.
To summarise the data from Experiments 1-3 (Figures
1-3 show the data plots), robust within-language repetition priming was observed in all three languages in
our German-English-French trilinguals (L1-GermanGerman: 40 ms; L2-English-English: 44 ms; L3-FrenchFrench: 46 ms). Importantly, translation priming was
only observed in three language directions (i.e. L2-L1:
15 ms, L1-L3: 17 ms and L2-L3: 25 ms) but absent in
the other three language directions (i.e. L1-L2, L3-L2,
L3-L1). So, priming asymmetry was observed for each
pair of the three languages. In addition, repetition
priming was significantly stronger than translation
priming in all three languages.

evaluating whether a particular credible interval does
or does not contain the null value of 0 in the case of pairwise comparisons. If our posterior distributions are consistent with the analyses from the frequentist approach,
namely the above LME analyses, we can be confident in
our data and conclusions. Due to the small sample size,
though, we acknowledge that statistical power might be
problematic for such an analysis and therefore the
results need to be viewed with some caution.
In order to estimate our parameters of interest, we
fitted multi-level Bayesian regressions on the combined
full dataset across L1-German (i.e. Experiment 1), L2English (i.e. Experiment 2) and L3-French (i.e. Experiment
3) datasets, as well as the separate datasets for each
target language. For each model, we specified a full
model with all random slopes, random intercepts, and
correlation parameters that were justified by the
design. For the fixed effects, the models for the combined dataset included zero-sum coded langdir and
session predictors. However, for the sake of simplicity,
we only included zero-sum coded langdir as the predictor in the models for the separate datasets for each
target language, because session revealed neither main
effects nor interactions in the previous frequentist analysis. To test our hypotheses, we rely on the parameter
estimation approach (Kruschke, 2014) and check if the

3.4. Bayesian analyses
To address the issue of how confidently we can draw
conclusions from our results regarding cross-language
translation priming and priming asymmetry in trilinguals, we use the Bayesian framework to analyse our
data. That is, we can show a probability distribution of
translation priming effects and priming asymmetry by

Figure 1. Experiment 1 data plots (German targets).

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

credible interval (CI) includes or excludes the null value.
If the CI excludes the null value, we can conclude that
the null is not a credible value for that effect. Otherwise,
the null value can be considered as a credible value, and
hence, the effect is considered as not being credible. We
used the brms (Burkner, 2017), emmeans (Russell, 2019)
and tidybayes (Kay, 2020) packages to run the model,
and to extract predictive posterior draws.
For the separate datasets in Experiment 1, 2 and 3, we
ran a Bayesian mixed model with the log normal likelihood on the main dependent variable, namely, reaction
times. In the reaction time analyses, each model contained language direction as the fixed factor and a
maximal random effect structure. The priors for all parameters in each model were set to be uninformative.
The exact model structure, prior specifications, posterior
predictive reaction times, and model diagnostics can be
found in the supplementary online materials at OSF
(https://osf.io/8m4bn/). To test both repetition priming
and translation priming effects in each target language
dataset (Experiment 1, 2, 3), we show the posterior predictive distributions of the priming effects in reaction
times in Figure 4.
Repetition Priming. Repetition priming is defined as
the difference in reaction time of targets that were the
same as the primes compared to the baseline condition

(i.e. L1-L1 vs. unrel, L2-L2 vs. unrel, L3-L3 vs. unrel).
Figure 4 shows that 100% of the posterior distributions
of repetition priming effects in each language are
above zero: L1-L1/unrel (M = 41, CI = [30.1, 52.2]); L2L2/unrel (M = 44.9, CI = [29.2, 61.0]); L3-L3/unrel (M =
47.4, CI = [29.3, 67.7]). These findings, which are consistent with the results of frequentist analyses, indicate that
the repetition priming effect is highly credible and
robust in all three languages. Similarly, 100% of the posterior distributions of repetition priming compared to
translation priming in each target language are above
or below zero: L1-L1/ L3-L1 (M = 43.6, CI = [34.9, 52.1]);
L1-L1/L2-L1 (M = 26.8, CI = [18.4, 35.9]); L2-L2/L1-L2 (M
= -39.6, CI = [-49.3, - 29.2]); L2-L2/L3-L2 (M = 51.5, CI
= [40.4, 62.7]); L3-L3/L1-L3 (M = -34, CI = [-46.3, -
20.9]); L3-L3/L2-L3 (M = -29.6, CI = [-43.9, - 16.4]). In
line with the LME analyses, these results demonstrate
that all three languages were effectively processed by
the trilinguals and that repetition priming was significantly greater than translation priming in all three
languages.
Translation Priming. Translation priming is defined
as the difference in reaction time of targets that were
the translations of the primes compared to the baseline
condition. In Figure 4, L1-L2, L3-L2, and L3-L1 translation
priming effects are not credible as the 95% credible
intervals of the posterior distributions of these effects
include zero: L1-L2/unrel (M = 5.27, CI = [-6.47, 17]); L3L2/unrel (M = -6.59, CI = [-19.8, 5.66]); L3-L1/unrel (M
= -2.61, CI = [-13.9, 7.88]). In contrast, L2-L3 and L2-L1
translation priming effects are robust as the 95% credible intervals of the posteriors exclude zero, indicating
that the translation priming effects in these language
directions are credible: L2-L3/unrel (M = 17.8, CI = [0.55,
37.5]); L2-L1/unrel (M = 14.2, CI = [2.07, 27.4]). Note that
the 95% credible interval for L1-L3 translation priming
includes zero: L1-L3/unrel (M = 13.5, CI = [-3.66, 29.8]).
This might be taken to be inconsistent with the null
hypothesis testing approach. However, we also calculated the probability of direction, which is the proportion
of the distribution that falls above or below zero. Only
4.91% of the posterior distribution falls below zero in
L1-L3 translation priming, indicating that L1-L3 priming
effect has a 95.09% chance of being greater than zero.
That is, the odds favour a positive effect over a negative
effect by approximately 19:1. This suggests that while
the CI includes 0, the posterior distribution still strongly
favours a positive effect. Thus, we have enough evidence
to show that L1-L3 translation priming is strong, in line
with the LME analysis. Using the same logic, we calculated and showed the percentage of the posterior distributions that falls below zero in L2-L1 translation priming
(i.e. 1.46%) and L2-L3 translation priming (i.e. 2.58%),

respectively. In other words, L2-L1 priming has a 98.54%
chance of being greater than zero; and L2-L3 priming
has a 97.42% chance of being greater than zero. Therefore, the probability of a positive effect, demonstrated

in the statistics (i.e. 95.09% in L1-L3, 98.54% in L2-L1,
97.42% in L2-L3) is strongly favoured over a negative
effect in all three translation priming directions. Here,
again, we show priming asymmetry in translation

priming such that translation priming effect was only
credible in one direction in any given language pair, consistent with the results in LME.
For the combined dataset of Experiment 1, 2 and 3,
we ran another hierarchical Bayesian mixed model. In
both reaction time and accuracy analyses, each model
contained language direction and session and their interaction as fixed factors and a maximal random effect
structure. We used the log normal and Bernoulli (with
a logit link function) distributions to model reaction
time and accuracy data respectively. The priors for all
parameters in each model were set to be uninformative.
The exact model structure, prior specifications, posterior
predictive reaction times and accuracy, and model diagnostics can be found in the supplementary online
materials at OSF (https://osf.io/8m4bn/). To test
priming asymmetry across different language pairs, we
show the posterior predictive distributions in both reaction times and accuracy in Figure 5 and 6, respectively.
Figure 5 summarises the posterior predictive distributions of priming asymmetry across 6 language
priming directions, including both repetition priming
and translation priming in reaction times. These posterior distributions show that L1-L1 and L2-L2 priming
trials are similar as the 95% credible interval of the differences between these two conditions include zero (M =
5.32, CI = [-4.05, 14.4]). This means that L1 and L2
have similar processing speed and proficiency. In contrast, the differences between L1-L1 and L3-L3 priming
trials (M = 85.2, CI = [61.7, 108]), as well as those
between L2-L2 and L3-L3 priming trials (M = 79.9, CI =
[57, 103]), are credible as the 95% credible intervals
exclude zero. This means that L3 significantly differs
from L1 and L2 in processing speech and proficiency.
Priming Asymmetry. As shown in Figure 5, L1-L2 and
L2-L1 translation priming trials are significantly different
from each other (M = -18.6, CI = [-32.1, - 5.17]), as well
as L1-L3 and L3-L1 translation priming trials (M = -72.9,
CI = [-93.8, - 53.2]), and L2-L3 and L3-L2 translation
priming trials (M = -56.2, CI = [-76, - 38.9]), because
the 95% credible intervals exclude zero. Although
these are not the direct comparisons of priming effects
in different language directions, these data suggest
credible asymmetry in reaction times between any pair
of the three languages in trilinguals. In addition, our analyses in the above separate datasets indirectly show a
clear translation priming asymmetry in these pairs (i.e.
L1-L2/L2-L1, L1-L3/L3-L1, L2-L3/L3-L2) by providing evidence of credible priming effects in one direction, but
not the other.
Figure 6 summarises the posterior predictive distributions of priming asymmetry across 6 language
priming directions, including both repetition priming

993

and translation priming in accuracy in log odd scale.
The results reveal that L1-L1 repetition priming trials
are not credibly different from L2-L2 repetition priming
trials as the CI of the posterior distribution of accuracy
difference includes zero as a credible value (M = 0.248,
CI = [-0.535, 1.05]) and that L1-L2 translation priming
trials are not credibly different from L2-L1 translation
priming trials (M = 0.16, CI = [-0.51, 0.79]). This means
that neither repetition priming, nor translation priming
trials differ between L1 and L2 in accuracy and the trilinguals made similar errors in both L1 and L2. This is consistent with the reaction time measure as both L1 and L2
show similar reaction times, except that L2-L1 priming is
credible, but not L1-L2. In contrast, both L1-L1/L3-L3 (M
= -1.47, CI = [-2.15, - 0.80]) and L2-L2/L3-L3 (M = -1.72,
CI = [-2.43, - 0.99]) repetition priming trials show significant differences as the CI of the effect distribution
excludes zero. Similarly, both L1-L3/L3-L1 (M = 1.17, CI
= [0.46, 1.86]) and L2-L3/L3-L2 (M = 0.87, CI = [0.21,
1.54]) translation priming trials show significant differences as the CI of the effect distribution excludes zero.
These results reveal that repetition priming trials
between L1 and L3, as well as those between L2 and
L3, differ from each other in accuracy, indicating that
the trilinguals are less accurate in responding to L3
than L1 and L2. This is consistent with the reaction
time measure, as L3 is slower than L1 and L2. The
same pattern applies to translation trials (i.e. L1-L3/L3L1 and L2-L3/L3-L2).
To summarise, our statistical analyses in the Bayesian
framework have confirmed our analyses in LME, showing
robust repetition priming in all three languages and that
translation priming only occurs in one direction, not the
other, in trilinguals. Importantly, these asymmetrical
translation priming effects across three languages
show an integrated conceptual representation across
three languages.

4. Discussion
The three key findings of the present study are: a) crosslanguage translation priming effects are observed across
all three languages of trilinguals, indicating that the trilingual lexicon has conceptual representations that are
common to the three languages; b) priming asymmetry
exists across all three languages: translation priming was
observed in L2-L1, L1-L3, and L2-L3, but not in L1-L2, L3L1, or L3-L2; c) the priming asymmetry between L1 and
L2 is in the opposite direction of what has been typically
found in the bilingual translation priming literature.
Within-language repetition priming in trilinguals. In all
three languages, we observed robust repetition priming
in the trilingual participants, which is consistent with the

literature on priming in bilingual readers (e.g. Aparicio &
Lavaur, 2016; Jiang, 1999; Midgley et al., 2009). These
priming effects are sizable given the 50 ms prime duration and are significantly larger than the observed
translation priming effects. In the monolingual literature,
repetition priming (as opposed to semantic or associative priming) is extremely robust under masked conditions (Evett & Humphreys, 1981; Forster & Davis,
1984), and is the strongest priming observed among
various types of prime-target relationships. Furthermore,
repetition priming is argued as evidence for the lexical
activation of the prime as it is typically larger than
form priming (e.g. horse-HOUSE) and absent for
nonword targets (Forster, 1999; Forster & Davis, 1984).
Such evidence suggests that repetition priming is not
simply due to the repetition of lexical forms, but that
there is a lexico-semantic processing of the primes
taking place (Davis et al., 2008). Consistent with the repetition priming effects that have typically been reported
in both L1 and L2, our current within-language repetition priming in all three languages indicates that
primes with 50 ms duration in all three languages are
effectively processed, and very likely processed at the
lexical level. However, the puzzle is why we still observed

an asymmetry in translation priming given that the
primes in all three languages must have been effectively
processed to have generated repetition priming.
Language dominance shift. The mental lexicon of a
bilingual speaker is likely to continue to develop and
change depending on their experience with the two
languages and cultures in their lifetime (Costa et al.,
2016). How do the current models predict crosslanguage priming patterns over the course of language
development of a bilingual/multilingual's life span?
Given increasing proficiency in L2 (e.g. via language
and culture immersion), it is likely that the number of
L2 senses will develop beyond just the dominant one
(Wang, 2013). The SM predicts that L2 sense development can lead to a higher ratio of primed to unprimed
senses associated with L1 targets and result in L2-L1
priming when L2 proficiency is high (e.g. as in Figure 7
and 8 when L2 senses contain existing L1 senses), as
has been demonstrated in previous studies (e.g. Dunabeitia et al., 2010). As a corollary, the ratio of primed to
unprimed senses associated with L2 targets are
reduced with greater L2 proficiency. This will lead to
reduced or even null L1-L2 priming. Thus, priming asymmetry between L1 and L2 could reverse if the number of

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

senses developed in L2 exceeds those in L1. In contrast,
both the RHM and BIA/BIA + would predict continued
L1-L2 priming and the emergence of L2-L1 priming as
L2 proficiency increases. That is, priming should be
observed in both directions given the course of bilingual/multilingual development.
Consistent with the prediction of the SM, we
observed a reversal of the standard priming asymmetry,
with L2-L1 priming being significant (i.e. 15 ms) and L1L2 priming not (i.e. 5 ms). Given that the direction of the
asymmetry is the opposite of what is typically found, it
leads to the speculation that there has been a language
dominance shift between L1 and L2 in the trilinguals.
That is, contrary to the typical situation where L1 is
more dominant than L2, these trilinguals appear to
have a more dominant L2-English than L1-German. Presumably, the L2 behaves more like the L1 because of
extensive use of L2 in a native-speaking environment
for a significant amount of time as is the case with our
current trilinguals, even though the participants selfrated their L1 and L2 with equal proficiency in reading,

living in the L2 environment.

writing and speaking. It may be that the participants
subconsciously biased their self-ratings based on the
order of acquisition of their languages. Indeed, the RTs
in L1 and L2 are very similar in the control condition
(495 ms in L1-German vs. 503 ms in L2-English), which
indicates that L2 has become as proficient as L1 in this
measure. This might imply that proficiency is not the
critical factor in determining dominance, but instead,
the recent and sustained usage of a language might
prove more important.
A similar potential dominance shift has been reported
in a study by Basnight-Brown and Altarriba (2007) in
which Spanish-English bilinguals showed both L1-L2
and L2-L1 effects in unmasked translation priming, but
only a significant L2-L1 effect in unmasked semantic
priming. In the unmasked priming paradigm, translation
priming involves strategic effects, but semantic priming
is taken as evidence of conceptual connections between
L1 and L2. L2-L1 semantic priming asymmetry indicates
that L2 is the more dominant language. Thus, the
researchers argued that a dominance shift can
influence how words are represented in bilingual
memory. As shown in the present study, an individual's
non-native language is able to become his/her dominant language, as language dominance is not a static
characteristic (Heredia, 1997).
Priming asymmetry in trilinguals. Translation priming
asymmetry was observed across all three languages. In
addition to the fact that there was L2-L1 translation
priming and not the reverse, both L1 and L2 primed L3
and not vice versa. These findings suggest that all
three languages are integrated to some extent at the
conceptual/semantic level in the trilingual lexicon.
However, priming asymmetry across three languages is
not what one would expect if any two of the three
languages overlapped completely at the conceptual
level (i.e. shared the same senses), which should
produce equal amounts of priming in both directions
(i.e. symmetry).
As discussed earlier, one straightforward account for
priming asymmetry is related to language proficiency.
If bilinguals are more proficient in one of their languages
than in the other, they benefit more from primes in the
former than the latter. This account seems appealing but
is inadequate for two reasons. One is that the measurement of proficiency is hard to be standardised and varies
across studies. For this reason, the proficiency account is
somewhat vague. The other is that proficiency fails to
explain two sets of masked priming results: withinlanguage repetition priming and task-dependent
effects in L2-L1 priming. Importantly, our current
results appear to go against the proficiency account.
The failure to observe L1-L2 priming cannot be due to

996

lack of proficiency in L1 since proficiency in L1 is not in
doubt. Moreover, L1-L3 priming is observed, showing
that L1 is effective and proficient. In other words, if L1
is proficiency enough to prime L3, why not L2?
Thus, we consider the SM as a more promising explanation for trilingual priming asymmetry. A clear pattern
emerging from the current data is that priming asymmetry exists between any given pair of three languages. One
way to make sense of this asymmetry is to consider the
senses associated with one language in the trilingual
lexicon. A more dominant language, which arguably has
more senses given more exposure and experiences, is
able to prime the less dominant language. For example,
Wang (2013) showed that English-dominant EnglishChinese bilinguals only produced L1-L2 priming while
balanced English-Chinese bilinguals produced priming
in both directions. In other words, language dominance,
a measure of relative proficiency, rather than proficiency
per se, is a critical factor in modulating translation
priming patterns. According to the SM, this asymmetry
results from the asymmetrical semantic representations
across the three languages: L2 being the most competent,
and L3 being the least competent. Thus, we argue that L2
becomes more dominant with more senses due to the
extensive experience and exposure in the L2 environment
and results in L2-L1 priming instead of L1-L2 priming.
Clearly, as L3 was learned in the classroom setting and
used a lot less by these trilinguals, priming was only
observed in L1-L3 and L2-L3. The crucial and novel
finding of the current study is that L3 is conceptually integrated with both L1 and L2 by demonstrating both L1-L3
and L2-L3 priming. This finding results from a direct test of
the inter-lingual connection of L3 with L1 and L2 at the
conceptual level, consistent with the results of Francis
and Gallard (2005) demonstrating cross-language effects
in word translation tasks in trilinguals. Our findings also
complement the studies of Aparicio and Lavaur (2016)
and Tytus (2017) providing evidence for L1-L3 and L2-L3
priming effects.
The main difference between the SM and other bilingual models is its ability to explain priming asymmetry
and that it interprets proficiency/competence in terms
of semantic senses acquired in that language. This
lexico-semantic approach is consistent with recent
developments in the literature advocating lexical
models that incorporate learning and memory processes
that account for greater variance in the word recognition
data than mere word frequency (Adelman et al., 2006;
Cevoli et al., 2021; Johns et al., 2012; Johns et al., 2016;
Johns et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2012). For example,
Adelman et al. (2006) showed that the number of contexts (i.e. contextual diversity) in which a word occurs
in different corpora provides a better fit to recognition

latency over raw frequency. Similarly, Jones et al.
(2012) demonstrated that a measure of this contextual
diversity, namely, semantic diversity, modulates word
recognition latency. That is, words learned across multiple contexts (i.e. high semantic diversity) are retrieved
more quickly than words learned in redundant contexts
(i.e. low semantic diversity). Thus, lexical processing is
sensitive to contextual diversity and semantic diversity,
depending on its strength in memory. These findings
imply that a word that is learned and used in different
contexts, potentially with different senses, has a representational and processing advantage over those
with fewer senses. Such an idea consolidates the gist
of the SM, which proposes the representational asymmetry between L1 and L2 at the conceptual level as
the consequence of the asymmetrical usage of
different senses across languages.
In the case of multilingual speakers, we might anticipate ongoing changes of lexical representations given
one's circumstances in terms of language experience
(e.g. multilingualism, aging). For example, Johns et al.
(2016) show that bilinguals and older adults are more
sensitive to semantic diversity information than
younger monolinguals. This means that coordinating
between two or more languages can end up with
lexical representations as a result of a unique set of trilingual experiences for each individual, instead of a combination of three monolingual lexical representations. That
is, with multilingual speakers, we should anticipate
much more variability across participants in lexical representations. As such, our methodological approach to
investigating the trilingual lexico-semantic organisation
by recruiting a homogeneous trilingual group with a
repeated testing paradigm is justified.
To summarise, our results show that priming asymmetry persists in trilinguals and language dominance
can shift between L1 and L2. To account for these
findings, simply assuming a shared semantic architecture of L1, L2 and L3 is incomplete, as the priming asymmetry must be explained. As raised in a debate about
bilingual modelling (Brysbaert & Duyck, 2010; Kroll
et al., 2010), it is important to ask to what extent the
semantic information for translation equivalents is
language-dependent and to what extent it is
language-independent. It is reasonable to claim that
translation equivalents are not totally identical in
meaning but overlap to a considerable degree. In fact,
there are a number of reports showing that meaning
representations of L1 actually differ from L2 for translation equivalents (e.g. Ameel et al., 2009; Gollan et al.,
2005). The SM, a parsimonious framework to account
for the different representations of L1 and L2 at the
semantic level, indicates that there are more senses

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

associated with the dominant language, and that
priming is always more effective when the prime is in
the dominant language (for a similar view, see Duyck &
Brysbaert, 2004). That is, not only do the shared senses
spread activation to the other language, but the ratio
of the primed semantic senses to the language-dependent senses might cause the asymmetry in priming.
The SM accounts for increased L2-L1 priming effects
with increased L2 proficiency and explains decreased
L1-L2 priming effects when L2 has become dominant
(Wang, 2013; 2014). As more senses are developed for
L2, the proportion of senses primed by L1 out of total
L2 senses decreases. Should L2 becomes much more
dominant than L1, it is even possible that L1-L2
priming effects will disappear altogether as might have
been the case in the current study. Thus, it is not the
order of acquisition which dictates priming effects, but
the dominance of the languages in question, an assertion which the results of the present study support.
Finally, we propose a trilingual model based on the SM
to specify the lexico-semantic architecture of the trilingual lexicon. Importantly, our model needs to be able
to explain our three key findings. At the time of testing,
all trilinguals had lived in the UK for a certain number of
years for work or study. Therefore, after the L2 immersion
experiences, it is suggested that these trilinguals have
developed more semantic senses for L2 that are relevant
to existing L1 senses, thus revealing significant L2-L1
priming but null L1-L2 priming, as shown in Figure 7. If
newly developed L2 senses are irrelevant to existing L1
senses, we would not have observed L2-L1 priming
based on the SM, as the ratio of primed to unprimed L1
senses would remain unchanged. In addition, the
priming asymmetries across the three languages can be
a result of the asymmetrical semantic representations
across the three languages, as shown in Figure 8. Both
figures represent the trilingual lexicon in the language

development of one type of multilingual over time. This
type of multilingual significantly develops their L2 after
moving to the L2 environment and their L3, having
been learned as a foreign language, is much less competent than L1 or L2. All three languages are conceptually
engaged and integrated with each other through their
shared senses, and the high proportion of primed to
unprimed senses in the target language drive translation
priming for L1-L3, L2-L3 and L2-L1. Conversely, the
absence of translation priming in the other direction is
attributed to the low proportion of primed to unprimed
senses in the target language, as a result of the asymmetrical semantic representations across L1, L2 and L3. That
is, the most dominant language, L2-English, has developed the most senses to be able to prime both L1 and
L3, while L1 is still more dominant than L3 to be able to
produce priming. However, due to the low proportion
of primed senses to unprimed senses in L3-L1, L3-L2
and L1-L2, we failed to observe priming effects.

Note
1. We used the "mixed" function in the afex package in our
analyses, which generates different outputs in the predictor label level suffix from those when using "lmer".
This is due to the fact that "mixed" by default uses
sum-to-zero contrasts whereas base R uses treatment
contrasts (in which the first factor level is the baseline,
as in "lmer"). Sum-to-zero contrasts are a better choice
here to test interactions of categorical variables and
Type III sums-of-squares tests of fixed effect terms. As
a result, the interpretations of the fixed effect estimates
are different: "lmer" gives the treatment-contrasts and
reflects the difference of this factor level from the reference level; while "mixed" gives the sum-to-zero contrasts and reflects the difference from the grand mean.
