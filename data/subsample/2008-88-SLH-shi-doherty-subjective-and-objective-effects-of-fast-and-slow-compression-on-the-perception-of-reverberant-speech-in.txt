Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to assess the effect of fast and slow
attack/release times (ATs/RTs) on aided perception of reverberant speech in quiet.
Method: Thirty listeners with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss were tested
monaurally with a commercial hearing aid programmed in 3 AT/RT settings: linear,
fast (AT = 9 ms, RT = 90 ms), and slow (AT = 900 ms, RT = 1,500 ms). Stimuli
consisted of 200 low-predictability Speech-Perception-in-Noise sentences, presented
at 60 dB SPL at 4 reverberation levels (RT60 = 0, 0.6, 1.2, and 3.6 s). Listeners were
randomly presented with 12 listening conditions (3 AT/RT settings x 4 reverberation
levels). Intelligibility scores and clarity ratings of the sentences were obtained.
Results: Aided speech intelligibility and clarity significantly decreased as reverberation
increased. Both fast and slow ATs/RTs resulted in significantly higher speech
intelligibility than linear, but no significant difference was observed between fast and
slow ATs/RTs. Clarity rating was similar across 3 settings; however, rating decreased
the fastest with fast AT/RT as reverberation increased. Slow AT/RT resulted in
significantly higher real-ear aided response than fast AT/RT and linear, despite the
same programmed gain for all settings.
Conclusion: Reverberation had a more significant effect on aided speech perception
than AT/RT, but fast and slow AT/RT resulted in improved speech intelligibility
over linear amplification.

ide-dynamic-range compression (WDRC) hearing aids provide level-dependent gain based on the intensity of the input
signal. This amplification strategy is designed to maximize
audibility of low-level inputs without overamplifying high-level inputs
(e.g., Dillon, 1996; Hickson, 1994; Kuk, 1996; Souza, 2002). As a result,
inputs of a wide intensity range are compressed to fit into the reduced
dynamic range of a listener's impaired hearing. However, compression
introduces distortion to input signals, compared with linear amplification (e.g., Gordon-Salant, 1986; Kuk, 1996; Van Tasell, 1993). The source
of this distortion can be related to many static parameters, such as compression ratio (CR), compression threshold (CT), number of compression
channels, and so forth; however, it can also result from the attack time
(AT) and release time (RT) of the compression circuit (e.g., Jenstad &
Souza, 2005; Stone & Moore, 1992; Van Tasell & Trine, 1996). AT is defined as the time it takes for a compression system to activate, and RT is

the time it takes for the system to deactivate in response to a given change in input level (American National
Standards Institute [ANSI], 1996b).
The effect of AT/RT on the temporal properties of
speech signals has been extensively documented (e.g.,
Braida, Durlach, De Gennaro, Peterson, & Bustamante,
1982; Jenstad & Souza, 2005; Plomp, 1988; Stone &
Moore, 1992, 2007; Van Tasell & Trine, 1996; Verschuure
et al., 1996). A fast AT ( 10 ms) and fast RT ( 150 ms) is
usually referred to as syllabic compression (e.g., Hickson,
1994; Kuk, 1996). Fast AT/RT allows the compression
system to respond to level changes between syllables
and sometimes even between phonemes. In doing so,
low-intensity consonants are amplified more than vowels. The trade-off is that fast AT/RT results in higher
temporal distortion, compared with slow AT/RT (Jenstad
& Souza, 2005; Plomp, 1988; Stone & Moore, 1992, 2007).
Jenstad and Souza (2005) used the envelope-difference
index and the consonant-to-vowel ratio to measure the
amount of temporal distortion that was introduced by
compression. They found that a very fast RT (12 ms)
produced significantly more differences in envelopedifference index and consonant-to-vowel ratio measurements than slow RTs (100 and 800 ms). Similarly,
measuring the within- and across-signal modulation correlations between the original and compressed inputs,
Stone and Moore (2007) reported higher envelope distortion of running speech with fast compression (AT =
2 ms, RT = 240 ms) than with slow compression (AT =
350 ms, RT = 1,080 ms).
When long time constants, especially long RTs (e.g.,
500-2,000 ms), are used, the compression system cannot react to quick changes in level (e.g., Hickson, 1994;
Kuk, 1996; Moore & Glasberg, 1988) and, therefore, seems
to retain the overall temporal envelope of speech better
than syllabic compression (Plomp, 1988). However, for
signals that fluctuate faster than the prescribed long
AT values, the steady state of compression will not be
reached before the compression deactivates. Also, if
a weak speech segment (e.g., consonants) falls within a
long RT, then as compression is being deactivated from
a stronger preceding segment (e.g., vowels), the weak
segment will be underamplified (Kuk, 1996).
Yet, even with these established effects of different
ATs/RTs on the temporal aspects of speech, it is still not
quite clear what exact impact these effects have on listeners' speech intelligibility. Previous findings reported
for different ATs/RTs have been inconsistent using either laboratory simulations of compression hearing aids
(e.g., Jenstad & Souza, 2005; Moore & Glasberg, 1988;
Stone & Moore, 2004; Van Tasell & Trine, 1996) or wearable hearing aids (e.g., Gatehouse, Naylor, & Elberling,
2006; Moore, Stainsby, Alcantara, & Kuhnel, 2004; Stone,
Moore, Alcantara, & Glasberg, 1999). Van Tasell and Trine
(1996), for example, examined various AT/RT values

(50, 100, and 200 ms) together with different CR values
(2:1, 4:1, and 8:1) and found that the combination of
a fast AT/RT and high CR resulted in low intelligibility
of vowel-consonant-vowel syllables. Some studies have
shown improved speech intelligibility with long ATs/RTs
(Moore & Glasberg, 1988; Moore, Glasberg, & Stone,
1991; Stone & Moore, 2004), but others (e.g., Gatehouse
et al., 2006; Jenstad & Souza, 2005) recently found no
consistent improvement in phonemic intelligibility with
long RTs. For example, Jenstad and Souza (2005) reported that some plosives and affricates were actually
perceived better with a short RT (12 ms) compared with
a longer RT (800 ms). There have also been a few studies
that reported a minimal advantage in speech intelligibility of slow AT/RT over fast or vice versa (Moore et al.,
2004; Stone et al., 1999). Therefore, more research is
needed on which AT/RT settings are best for listeners'
speech intelligibility.
ATs and RTs can also influence a listener's perceived
quality of sound (e.g., Gatehouse et al., 2006; Hansen,
2002; Hohmann & Kollmeier, 1995; Lunner, Hellgren,
Arlinger, & Elberling, 1997, 1998; Neuman, Bakke,
Hellman, & Levitt, 1994; Neuman, Bakke, Mackersie, &
Hellman, 1998; Neuman, Bakke, Mackersie, Hellman, &
Levitt, 1995). In a series of studies, Neuman et al. (1994,
1995, 1998) altered CR and /or RT in a simulated onechannel compression system. They found that listeners
preferred long RTs (200 and 1,000 ms) with a relatively
high CR (3:1), but changes in RT did not make a difference in listeners' perception of sound quality with
lower CRs (< 2:1). Thus, a long AT/RT may be preferable
for a more severe hearing loss that requires a high CR to
compress speech signals into a listener's reduced dynamic range. Similarly, Hansen (2002) found that listeners preferred a long AT (100 ms) and long RT (4,000 ms)
when listening to speech and music. On the other hand,
Lunner et al. (1998) found no preference in the quality of
speech across different AT/ RT settings when perceived
through a wearable hearing aid.
Perhaps the experimental design in some of these
studies (e.g., clear speech presented in quiet) may not be
sensitive enough to measure the fine effects of the AT/RT.
In most realistic listening environments, speech is present in some level of noise and reverberation. This kind of
listening situation can be a major challenge for hearing
aid users because noise and reverberation can temporally
degrade the speech signal. The effect of noise on aided
speech intelligibility has been evaluated in many studies
(e.g., Jenstad & Souza, 2005; Moore et al., 2004; Stone
et al., 1999; Van Tasell & Trine, 1996), but few have investigated the effect of reverberation on aided speech
intelligibility (I. V. Nablek, 1983).
Reverberation can affect speech in two ways: overlap masking (A. K. Nablek, Letowski, & Tucker, 1989),
which is due to the temporal delay of the original signal

introduced by reflection and causes the later part of
a running speech signal to be masked by the preceding
part (Houtgast & Steeneken, 1973; Lochner & Burger,
1961), and self-masking (A. K. Nablek et al., 1989), which
is the smearing of the spectrotemporal structure within
one phoneme. In addition, reverberation smears higher
rate fluctuations (50-500 Hz) in speech (Rosen, 1992),
resulting in smoothing of the spectrotemporal envelope (Gordon-Salant & Fitzgibbons, 1999; Helfer, 1994;
Houtgast and Steeneken, 1973). Perceptual confusions
that result from temporal alterations due to reverberation include monophthongs/diphthongs (A. K. Nablek,
1988), glides/liquids/nasals (Helfer & Huntley, 1991), and
voiceless plosives (Hedrick & Younger, 2007). Thus, listeners' speech intelligibility can significantly decrease
as reverberation increases (e.g., Duquesnoy & Plomp,
1980; Gordon-Salant & Fitzgibbons, 1993, 1999; Harris
& Reitz, 1985; Helfer & Wilber, 1990; A. K. Nablek &
Robinson, 1982; Payton, Uchanski, & Braida, 1994).
Currently, there is little evidence on how reverberation affects listeners' performance with hearing aids, especially in light of its relationship with the WDRC time
constants. The temporal changes due to reverberation
may interact with the temporal changes because of the
AT/ RT in compression systems. The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate this combined
effect by examining listeners' perception of speech at
different reverberation levels using a commercial hearing aid programmed in different fast and slow AT/ RT
settings. Specifically, the following two hypotheses were
tested:
1.

Intelligibility and perceived clarity of reverberant
speech using WDRC amplification will deteriorate
as reverberation increases.

2.

Fast AT/RT will result in lower aided speech intelligibility and clarity than slow AT/ RT. This is based
on evidence that greater temporal distortion occurs
with faster ATs/ RTs.

Method
Participants
Thirty listeners (57-78 years of age, mean = 70.76 years;
15 men and 15 women) with a symmetrical, mild-tomoderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in this
study. This sample size sufficed a power of 0.80, on the
basis of the mean intelligibility scores and standard
deviation of sentences processed with reverberation
reported by Gordon-Salant and Fitzgibbons (1993). Listeners' hearing thresholds did not exceed 75 dB HL (ANSI,
1996a) at any test frequency between 250 and 4000 Hz
(see Figure 1). Middle-ear immittance measures were
within the normal range. No listeners were tested for

cochlear dead regions because the degree of hearing
loss was mild to moderate.
All listeners had worn a hearing aid for a minimum
of 6 months prior to the study. Listeners' own hearing
aids varied widely in their makes and models, but none
of them were products of Siemens Hearing Instruments
(Piscataway, New Jersey). In addition, these aids varied
widely in their AT/ RT settings (e.g., Sonic Innovation
Natura3: AT = 5 ms, RT , 10 ms; Phonak Claro, older
model: AT = RT = 5,000 ms).
In addition to listeners with hearing loss, 15 normalhearing listeners (7 men, 8 women) between 18 and
30 years of age (mean = 25.47 years) were tested to evaluate the variability of the reverberant speech stimuli developed by Sandridge, Newman, Spitzer, and Katz (2005).
Normal hearing was defined as hearing thresholds less
than or equal to 20 dB HL at the octave frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz (ANSI, 1996a).

Hearing Aids
All listeners with hearing loss were fitted monaurally with a Triano3 behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid,
manufactured by Siemens Hearing Instruments. Monaural testing was conducted because some listeners' prescribed compression settings (CR/CT) could be different
across ears, despite overall symmetrical hearing loss.
Testing monaurally should minimize the confounding
from these static compression characteristics. The Triano3
was selected because it offered adjustable fast and slow
AT/RT settings. A Comply tip (Westone, Colorado Springs,
Colorado) was used to couple the hearing aid to the
listener 's right ear. The tubing of the Comply tip was

directly connected to the tone hook of the BTE. No vent
was provided, as venting has the potential to alter compression effects due to leakage of direct sound (Dillon,
1996).
The hearing aid is a digital instrument with 16 bands
and four compression channels. It was programmed using the manufacturer's fitting software (Connexx) in the
NOAH v3.1.2 system (HIMSA, St. Paul, Minnesota). The
National Acoustic Laboratories-Nonlinear (NAL-NL1)
prescriptive fitting rationale (Byrne, Dillon, Katsch, Ching,
& Keidser, 2001) was used to set the target outputs and
channel-specific CR and CT values for each listener. Compression characteristics can be set in four independent
channels, whose center frequencies are 250, 1000, 2000,
and 4000 Hz. For each channel, CR, CT, and AT/ RT can
be adjusted. The CR reflects the difference in gain at
"soft" (40 dB SPL) and "loud" (80 dB SPL) input levels
and can vary between 1:1 and 4:1. The CT can be set
anywhere between 33 and 77 dB SPL in 3-dB steps.
There are two options available for selecting the AT/ RT
settings: (1) "syllabic," which has a 9-ms AT and a 90-ms
RT; and (2) "dual," which has a fast-acting component
(AT = 5 ms, RT = 90 ms) and a slow-acting component
(AT = 900 ms, RT = 1,500 ms). The slow-acting component of the compressor is activated when the input is
at or above the CT (33-77 dB SPL), whereas the fastacting component is only activated when the input is at
or exceeds 80 dB SPL.
In the current study, the aid was set for three different settings: linear, fast AT/RT (i.e., syllabic compression),
and slow AT/ RT, which used the slow-acting component
of the dual compressor (see Table 1). In the linear condition, the CR was set at 1:1, and AT/ RT used null values; in the two compression conditions, AT/ RT was set
at either "syllabic" or "dual" in all four channels, but
CR/CT values were the same for both the syllabic and
dual conditions. Because most of the listeners in this
study had a moderate hearing loss, the NAL-NL1 using the Connexx software typically prescribed the CR
between 1.07:1 and 2.67:1 and the CT between 33
and 53 dB SPL. For normal or near-normal thresholds,

NAL-NL1 prescribed no compression and minimal gain.
This situation happened most frequently in the 250-Hz
channel, where a few listeners had a mild low-frequency
hearing loss. To ensure some compression, the prescribed
"no compression" setting was overwritten with the lowest
amount of compression available in the Connexx software (i.e., CT = 33 dB SPL, CR = 1.07:1). Table 2 summarizes the average CR and CT values used in this study.
It was essential that the gain for a 60-dB-SPL input, the stimulus presentation level used in this study,
be the same for all three conditions ( linear, fast, and
slow). This level was selected for three reasons. First, it
represents low-to-normal conversational speech (ANSI,
1997). Second, it was close to the CT of the hearing aid,
which allowed the compression to be frequently activated and deactivated. Last, it was less likely to activate
the fast-acting component of the dual compressor, which
has a fixed threshold of 80 dB SPL.
Because the Connexx software only permits control
of the gain for a 40-dB-SPL input signal, the gain for a
60-dB-SPL input was computed from CR = D I/DO, where
D I is the change in input and DO the corresponding change
in output (Barker & Dillon, 1999). The gain and CR
for a 40-dB-SPL input were known from the Connexx
software; therefore, to obtain the same output for the
60-dB-SPL input, the gain at 40 dB SPL could be determined using the formula for all three settings. Readers are referred to Barker and Dillon (1999) for detailed
step-by-step derivation. These settings were then programmed into the three memories of the aid. The fourth
memory was disabled, as were the directional microphone,
feedback control, and other Triano3-specific features.
The "adaptation control" was set at the highest level
(Level 4), which corresponded to the gain appropriate
for an experienced user.
The aid was programmed for each listener on the
basis of the degree of the hearing loss. Real-ear measures
were obtained using a 12.5-s long discourse spoken in

a male voice in the Speechmap module on the Verifit
v2.4.27 system (Audioscan, Dorchester, Ontario, Canada).
This was done to verify that the aided output met or
was close to the NAL-NL1 target for a 70-dB-SPL input
(Etymonic Design, 2005). The criterion for a close match
was defined as an aided response within 10 dB of the
target (Dillon, 2001). If this criterion was not met, the
gain was independently adjusted in each of 16 bands to
match the target as closely as possible. Real-ear aided
responses (REARs) were then obtained at 60 dB SPL for
all three hearing aid settings so that they could be
compared at the presentation level of the test stimulus.

Stimuli
The Speech-Perception-in-Noise (SPIN) sentences
(Kalikow, Stevens, & Elliott, 1977) served as the speech
stimuli for several reasons. First, they have been used in
previous studies on perception of reverberant speech (e.g.,
Gordon-Salant & Fitzgibbons, 1993, 1999; Sandridge et al.,
2005). Second, the SPIN sentences are scored on the basis
of the last word. The buildup of reverberation is expected
to be the greatest by the time the last word is presented.
In Sandridge et al.'s (2005) study, a total of 200 lowpredictability SPIN sentences (i.e., eight lists) were processed at four different reverberation levels, each of which
corresponded to a specific reverberation time (RT60): The
unprocessed (UP) condition presented no reverberation;
the living room (LR) condition simulated a carpeted,
average-sized room; the classroom (CL) condition simulated a larger empty room with some carpeting; and the
hard hall (HH) condition simulated a very large empty
enclosed space (see Table 3). Sandridge et al. (2005) processed these sentences at a sampling rate of 44100 Hz
with 16-bit resolution. The recording had a nominal bandwidth of 20-20000 Hz, although the actual bandwidth
was limited to the original SPIN recording (80-10000 Hz;
Kalikow et al., 1977). In the current study, the reverberant
SPIN sentences were converted into .wav files at the same
sampling rate using the Easy CD Ripper v2.35 (Kongsoft)

sentences in quiet were used.

Procedure
Listeners with normal hearing. Normal-hearing listeners were tested in a single, 1-hr listening session. During
this session, pure-tone thresholds and speech recognition
thresholds (SRTs) were obtained using TDH-50P supraaural headphones (Telephonics, Farmingdale, New York).
Tympanometry was performed using the Welch Allyn
(Skaneateles Falls, New York) MicroTymp2 screener.
Listeners were presented with two SPIN lists (i.e.,
50 sentences) at each of the four reverberation levels
(RT60 = 0, 0.6, 1.2, and 3.6 s, respectively). Therefore, a
total of eight lists of SPIN sentences (2 lists x 4 reverberation levels) were presented in random order to each
listener. Sentences were played on a portable CD player
(Audiophase CDT-320, Paris, France), routed through a
GSI-16 audiometer (Grason-Stadler, Madison, Wisconsin),
and presented to listeners via a Grason-Stadler loudspeaker. The listener was positioned 1 m from the speaker
at a 0 azimuth in a sound-treated booth. Sentences
were presented at 40 dB SL re: SRT for each listener,
because this level was used in Sandridge et al.'s (2005)
experimental setup. Listeners were asked to write and
verbally repeat the last word in each sentence. The last
word was scored after the testing was completed. An
overall correct percentage was obtained for each condition on the basis of the number of key words the listener correctly responded to.
Listeners with hearing loss. Listeners with hearing
loss were tested in four 1-hr listening sessions. Sessions
were scheduled at least 2 weeks apart. In Session 1,
pure-tone thresholds, SRTs, and tympanometry data
were collected. Electroacoustic analyses were conducted
on the BTE to confirm that it met manufacturer 's specifications (Siemens Hearing Instruments, 2004) and were
repeated prior to every following test session. The BTE
was then programmed as described earlier.
A total of 12 listening conditions (3 AT/ RT settings x
4 reverberation levels) were tested for each listener over
the remaining three sessions. That is, four listening conditions were randomly presented in each session. Two
lists (a total of 50 sentences) were presented in each
listening condition. Given the limited number of SPIN
sentences, every 25-sentence list was used once in each
of the three test sessions. To minimize learning effect,
all eight lists were randomly presented across four listening conditions within each test session (Gordon-Salant
& Fitzgibbons, 1993, 1999). Therefore, no one list was
repeated within a single test session or a single listening
condition. See Table 4 for a description of how the lists
were randomized.

Each listener's unaided ear (left ear) was occluded
with an E-A-R Classic foam earplug (Aearo Technologies, Indianapolis, Indiana) during testing. All sentences
were presented at 60 dB SPL so that the fast component
of the dual compressor would not be activated. The input
level was confirmed at the listener's ear level using a sound
pressure level meter (Quest Technologies, Oconomowoc,
Wisconsin).
Sound quality was assessed using a clarity rating
scale from the Judgment of Sound Quality measure, developed by Gabrielsson, Schenkman, and Hagerman (1988).
Clarity was singled out because it has been shown to be
the most significant factor to determine overall sound
quality in hearing aid studies (e.g., Eisenberg, Dirks, &
Gornbein, 1997; Gabrielsson et al., 1988; Lunner et al.,
1997; Preminger & Van Tasell, 1995). Listeners were asked
to verbally rate the clarity of the sentences on an 11-point
scale ranging from 0 (minimum clarity) to 10 (maximum
clarity). Judgments were made after the listener completed all 50 sentences for each listening condition.

transformed scores for the four reverberation conditions
are shown in Figure 2. A one-way, repeated-measures
analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) revealed that intelligibility scores significantly decreased as reverberation
increased, F(3, 42) = 41.098, p < .001. A post hoc Tukey 's
honestly significant difference (HSD) test (adjusted a =
.05) revealed significant differences in pairwise comparisons between Condition UP and all reverberant conditions, and between Conditions LR and HH. Thus,
normal-hearing listeners' intelligibility of speech steadily
decreased as reverberation level increased. Even a small
amount of reverberation, such as that in a typical living
room, notably reduced listeners' intelligibility scores.
Error rates were calculated across normal-hearing
listeners for each low-predictability SPIN list at each
reverberation levels. Error rate was computed by the
number of words perceived wrong over the total number
of words in each list. Skinner et al. (2006) defined equivalency as the difference between two lists being no greater
than 6%. According to this criterion, significant interlist
variability existed for the CL and HH conditions. On the
basis of a one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's tests,
Lists 4, 6, and 7 were significantly more difficult than
List 5 ( p  .05) in the CL condition. In the HH condition, List 4 was significantly more difficult than all the
other lists except for List 7 ( p  .012), and List 7 was significantly more difficult than Lists 2, 5, and 8 ( p  .017).

REARs
A one-way RM-ANOVA showed that the REAR for a
60-dB-SPL speech input was significantly different across
AT/RT settings for all frequencies ( p < .001) except 250 Hz
(see Figure 3). A post hoc Tukey's test for 500-6000 Hz

revealed that the REARs for the slow AT/ RT were the
highest of the three settings for 500, 1500, and 6000 Hz
( p  .002), but no significant differences were observed
between the fast AT/ RT and linear setting at these frequencies. For 750, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, all
pairwise comparisons among linear, fast, and slow AT/RT
settings were statistically significant ( p < .001; except between fast and linear settings for 1000 Hz, p = .017). Thus,
although each setting was programmed with the same
gain for a 60-dB-SPL speech input, the slow AT/ RT setting resulted in higher REARs than the fast AT/ RT and
linear settings (up to 6 dB), and the fast AT/ RT resulted
in slightly but significantly higher REARs than linear
setting.

Intelligibility of Reverberant Sentences
in Hearing-Impaired Listeners
A two-way RM-ANOVAwas conducted across AT/ RT
settings and reverberation levels. No significant interaction was found between these two factors; however, the
main effect of reverberation on intelligibility was significant, F(3, 87) = 246.097, p < .001. Average performance
across linear, fast, and slow compression decreased from
66.3 RAU for the UP condition to 31.9 RAU for the HH
condition (see Figure 4). A post hoc Tukey 's HSD test
showed that as reverberation level increased, intelligibility significantly decreased for all pairwise comparisons
( p < .001). Also, sentence intelligibility was significantly
different across AT/ RT settings, F(2, 58) = 9.164, p < .001.
A Tukey's HSD test showed that intelligibility scores
were significantly lower for the linear setting compared
with slow ( p = .002) and fast ( p < .001) AT/ RT settings,
but they were not significantly different between the fast
and slow AT/ RT settings ( p = .835).

settings. The error bars represent 1 SE.

Effect size of the two main factors was computed to
show the magnitude of significance. Effect size was expressed in eta-squared (h2) and partial h2 (Cohen, 1988).
The index of h2 measures the proportion of total variance attributable to one factor. Partial h2 differs from h2
in that the denominator of the proportion is the sum
of the effect and error variances, not the total variance.
Effect-size measures showed h2 = .007 and partial h2 =
.116 for the AT/ RT factor, but h2 = .388 and partial h2 =
.872 for the reverberation-level factor. Thus, dynamic
compression characteristics (fast vs. slow AT/RT) had only
a small effect on the aided speech intelligibility, whereas reverberation played a more significant role on intelligibility.

Clarity Ratings of Reverberant Sentences
in Hearing-Impaired Listeners
A two-way RM-ANOVA revealed that clarity ratings
significantly decreased as reverberation level increased,
F(3, 114) = 99.873, p < .001, as shown in Figure 5. A post
hoc Tukey 's HSD test showed that all pairwise comparisons across reverberation levels were statistically significant ( p  .005), indicating that reverberation had a
strong effect on listeners' perceived clarity of speech. No
significant differences, however, were observed across
AT/ RT settings, F(2, 174) = 8.270, p = .101, except between the fast and linear settings for the UP condition
( p < .001). A significant AT/ RT Setting x Reverberation Level interaction was also found, F(6, 174) = 2.743,
p = .014. This effect was largely due to a greater reduction in clarity ratings from the UP condition to the HH
condition for fast AT/ RT than the other two settings.
Thus, the lack of significant difference between any two

reduced for both fast and slow ATs/ RTs. However, fast
and slow ATs/ RTs resulted in comparable intelligibility
scores. The clarity of speech was degraded more substantially for the fast AT/ RT setting than the slow AT/ RT setting. Also, with the same prescribed gain, slow AT/ RT
yielded significantly higher REARs than the fast AT/ RT.

Verification of Test Stimuli
Existing data on the reverberant SPIN sentences
(Sandridge et al., 2005) used in this study were minimal. For example, the exact amount of acoustical degradation of these sentences due to reverberation has not
been reported. Methods such as speech transmission index (Houtgast & Steeneken, 1973) should be considered
in future studies to precisely quantify the degradation.

of the AT/ RT settings for the LR, CL, and HH conditions
suggested that dynamic compression characteristics did
not play a critical role in the listeners' perceived clarity
of the reverberant sentences. Similar to the intelligibility results, reverberation had a larger effect size (h2 =
.261; partial h2 = .652) than AT/ RT (h2 = .004; partial
h2 = .032).

Learning Effects
Each listener was presented with each SPIN list
three times throughout the study, but no single SPIN list
was presented more than once within a test session or listening condition. Nevertheless, listeners' intelligibility
scores and clarity ratings were assessed across test sessions to determine whether there were any learning effects.
A one-way RM-ANOVA demonstrated that a significant
increase in RAU was observed between Session 2 and
Session 4 ( p = .003), but the average difference was only
2.6 RAU. No significant differences were observed between Sessions 2 and 3 or Sessions 3 and 4. Clarity rating did not increase or decrease over sessions. Thus, in
general, both intelligibility scores and clarity ratings
remained stable across test sessions, indicating that
learning effects were minimal in this study.

Discussion
The current study evaluated the effect of fast and
slow ATs/ RTs on listeners' aided perception of reverberant speech. As the level of reverberation increased,
intelligibility and clarity of aided speech was significantly

In the current study, a group of normal-hearing listeners were tested, and their performance was compared with data reported for normal-hearing listeners
in Sandridge et al.'s (2005) study. In both studies, listeners consistently made more errors for some lists (e.g.,
List 4) than others (e.g., List 2), regardless of reverberation level. However, Sandridge et al. reported more similar interlist error rates than was found in the current
study. Listeners' age and gender were well matched between the two studies; consequently, the difference in
results is likely because Sandridge et al.'s normative data
were based on listeners' intelligibility of reverberant
sentences in multitalker babble, whereas in this study
the reverberant sentences were presented in quiet. It is,
however, unlikely that the small differences across lists
had affected the conclusions reached in this study because all lists were randomized across reverberation levels. Also, two lists were randomly selected and presented
for each listening condition, which further diminished
potential confounding from interlist inequivalency.

REARs
The gain for a 60-dB-SPL input was set equally for
the linear and two compression conditions. However, for
most test frequencies, the slow AT/ RT yielded a significantly higher REAR than the fast AT/ RT, and both slow
and fast ATs/ RTs yielded significantly higher REARs
than linear. The REAR is based on the long-term average of running speech. When presented at 60 dB SPL,
the speech had a dynamic range of roughly 42-72 dB SPL
(i.e., -18 to +12 re: 60 dB SPL; Pearsons, Bennett, &
Fidell, 1977). Because the 60-dB-SPL input level was
above the CTs of the aid, equally prescribed gain for this
level across three settings would mean higher gain for the
compression settings than the linear settings over a large
part of the dynamic range of speech (i.e., 42-60 dB SPL).
Therefore, it is not surprising that the linear setting resulted in the lowest overall REAR.

Interestingly, the REAR for the slow AT/ RT was
significantly higher than the fast AT/ RT setting, even
though the same gain, CR, and CT were programmed
for both AT/ RT settings at 60 dB SPL. This finding was
in conflict with previous studies that investigated the effect of AT/ RT settings on gain using a manikin (Ellison,
Harris, & Muller, 2003) or in listeners wearing Oticon
DigiFocus II hearing aids (Muller, Harris, & Ellison,
2004). Both of these two studies found that a short RT
(40 ms) resulted in a higher aided output than a long RT
(640 ms), and the differences could be as large as 6 dB.
The exact opposite was observed in the current study.
There are several reasons that might explain the
difference in hearing aid output between the current
study and the previous AT/ RT studies. First, in Ellison
et al.'s (2003) and Muller et al.'s (2004) studies, output
was averaged over three short sentences, whereas in this
study, the REAR was measured using the Speechmap
module of the Verifit, which used a 12.5-s long paragraph
as the input signal. This signal provided a speech sample
long enough to test AT/ RT. Also, in previous studies, the
AT was held at a constant value of 5 ms. Kuk (1996)
showed that slow ATs make it possible for the hearing
aid to undercompress the initial part of the speech when
the speech level exceeds the CT. Note that the gain for
stimulus levels above the CT is always lower than the
amount of gain for stimulus levels below the CT. Thus, a
slow AT may temporarily result in more gain than a fast
AT. In any event, the conflicting findings from these
studies suggest that more research is needed to fully investigate hearing aid output as a function of AT/RT while
accounting for speech dynamics.
Another factor that should be considered is the amount
of power within each compression channel. On the basis
of the speech intelligibility index (ANSI, 1997), the power
in the upper two frequency channels might have been
close to the higher CTs in some listeners. Thus, the effective amount of compression for these two channels could
have been limited. However, the significant differences
in REARs measured across settings, especially for the
higher frequencies, indicate that for a 60-dB-SPL input,
compression was in effect.

Aided Intelligibility of Reverberant
SPIN Sentences
Intelligibility of reverberant speech has been investigated in a number of studies (e.g., Duquesnoy & Plomp,
1980; Harris & Reitz, 1985; Helfer & Wilber, 1990; A. K.
Nablek & Robinson, 1982), but few have examined the
perception of aided reverberant speech (I. V. Nablek,
1983). In I. V. Nablek's (1983) study, higher intelligibility scores were reported for syllabic compression than
linear in quiet, but the advantage disappeared when
reverberation was introduced. In the current study,

1336

significantly higher intelligibility scores for reverberant speech were obtained with fast AT/ RT than linear
at all reverberation levels. One possible explanation
for the difference between the two studies is that I. V.
Nablek used nonsense syllables, whereas sentences
were used in the present study. Sentences are temporally more dynamic and are likely to activate compression more frequently than syllables.
The large effect sizes, observed in both aided intelligibility and clarity assessments, suggest that reverberation significantly compromises hearing aid users'
perception of speech. Hearing aid technology has advanced considerably in the past decade to improve speech
perception, especially in background noise. Yet, the effectiveness of directional microphones is considerably
compromised by reverberation (e.g., Hawkins & Yacullo,
1984; Ricketts, 2000). Algorithms have been proposed to
lessen the detrimental effects of reverberation on aided
speech (Kollmeier, Peissig, & Hohmann, 1993a, 1993b).
Further exploration in this area is warranted.
Irrespective of fast- or slow-acting ATs/ RTs, compression was shown here to have resulted in higher
speech intelligibility than linear. Some previous studies
demonstrated little differences in performance between
linear and compression settings (e.g., Hayes & Cormier,
2000; Humes, Humes, & Wilson, 2004), whereas others
reported a small increase in word discrimination or sentence recognition with compression compared with linear aids (Gatehouse et al., 2006; Kam & Wong, 1999;
Laurence, Moore, & Glasberg, 1983; Souza & Bishop,
2000; Walden, Surr, Cord, Edwards, & Olson, 2000). Although the current study was conducted in reverberation
without noise, the findings reported here are consistent
with studies that showed improved intelligibility with
compression even in noisy conditions (e.g., Gatehouse
et al., 2006; Laurence et al., 1983; Walden et al., 2000).
The higher intelligibility with compression may be attributed to the less gain with the linear setting than the
two compression settings for input levels below 60 dB SPL
(Dillon, 1996; Hickson, 1994; Souza & Bishop, 2000).
Although the slow AT/ RT resulted in the highest
REAR, no significant differences in speech intelligibility
were observed between fast and slow AT/ RT settings, indicating that small increases in output may not lead to
significantly higher speech intelligibility, which has been
suggested by other AT/ RT studies that used noise to
degrade the speech signal (e.g., Moore et al., 2004; Stone
et al., 1999). As a whole, these more recent findings are
in line with preexisting evidence that small changes in
the frequency spectrum of speech may not result in sizable changes in its intelligibility (van Buuren, Festen, &
Plomp, 1995; Van Dijkhuizen, Festen, & Plomp, 1989).
Although not statistically significant, fast AT/ RT
tended to yield higher SPIN scores across reverberant
levels than slow AT/ RT. Sung and Sung (1982) saw a

similar decrease in intelligibility scores with longer RTs
on a speech-in-noise test when RT was changed from
50 ms to 100, 200, and 500 ms. Recently, Jenstad and
Souza (2005) reported that listeners' recognition of
specific phonemes (e.g., /z/, /b/) improved when RT was
12 ms, compared with 100 and 800 ms, at a moderate
input level (65 dB SPL). The small differences in intelligibility observed in the current study are consistent with these reports.

Aided Clarity of Reverberant
SPIN Sentences
Although differences in intelligibility scores between
linear and compression hearing aids are minimal, listeners
have been shown to prefer the sound quality of compression (e.g., Gatehouse et al., 2006; Humes et al., 2004; Kam
& Wong, 1999; King & Martin, 1984; Souza, Jenstad, &
Folino, 2005; Walden et al., 2000). However, no clear preference in the clarity of speech was found in the current
study. Perhaps the lower distortion at very high input
levels and better audibility at low input levels afforded
by compression (Dillon, 1996) were offset by the moderate presentation level used in this study.
In a small number of studies that made direct comparisons in sound quality between fast and slow ATs/RTs,
listeners typically preferred long over short time constants
(e.g., Fredelake, Holube, & Hansen, 2006; Gatehouse
et al., 2006; Hansen, 2002; Hohmann & Kollmeier, 1995;
Neuman et al., 1998). In the current study, clarity deteriorated more for fast AT/ RT than slow AT/ RT because
the fast AT/ RT received the highest clarity rating in the
UP condition (i.e., no reverberation) and lowest clarity
rating in the HH condition (i.e., the greatest amount of
reverberation). Nevertheless, when comparing at any one
particular reverberation level, no significant difference
in speech clarity between fast and slow ATs/ RTs was
observed.
The disparity in results between this experiment
and previous AT/ RT studies may be attributed to methodological differences. First, in the current study, both
AT and RT values were changed across settings. In
Hansen's (2002) study, only AT was prolonged from 10
to 100 ms, whereas Fredelake et al. (2006) only examined the contribution of RT to speech quality. Second,
listeners' preference of different RTs depends on the
aspect of quality that is measured. It has been reported
that listeners perceived long RTs (1,000 ms) as having
a greater sound pleasantness, but they considered short
RTs (60 ms) better for loudness perception (Neuman
et al., 1998). Hansen and Fredelake et al. measured
overall sound quality, whereas in the current study, speech
clarity was specifically assessed. Last, analyses of effect
size suggest that the difference in clarity between fast
and slow ATs/ RTs became negligible when compared

with the deterioration in clarity due to reverberation.
In other words, the greater effect of reverberation on
speech clarity may have "masked" out the smaller effect of AT/ RT. Regardless of methodological differences
across AT/ RT studies, the "best" AT/ RT values remain
undetermined.

Conclusions
The current study examined the effect of AT/ RT on
listeners' aided perception of reverberant speech in
quiet. With the same prescribed gain, slow AT/ RT resulted in a significantly higher aided output level than
fast AT/ RT and linear settings. Compression, regardless
of fast or slow ATs/RTs, yielded significantly higher speech
intelligibility scores than linear amplification. Speech
clarity was similar across hearing aid settings. As the
level of reverberation increased, speech clarity deteriorated more for fast AT/ RT than slow AT/ RT and linear.
Overall, reverberation had a larger effect on aided speech
intelligibility and clarity than the AT/ RT settings.
