in Normally Hearing Children

Purpose: The goal was to assess the effects of maturation and phonological
development on performance, by normally hearing children, on an imitative test
of auditory capacity (On-Line Imitative Test of Speech-Pattern Contrast Perception
[OlimSpac]; Boothroyd, Eisenberg, & Martinez, 2006; Eisenberg, Martinez, &
Boothroyd, 2003, 2007).
Method: Thirty-four hearing children (aged between 1;8 [years;months] and 6;7)
were asked to imitate nonword utterances. Responses were evaluated by a blinded
listener in an 8-alternative forced-choice task, giving information on the children's
ability to convey, by imitation, information about 6 binary phonemic contrasts.
Results: Four children declined participation. Among 30 children aged 2;7 or older,
performance improved significantly with age and varied with contrast. All children
3 years of age or older attained passing scores (7 or 8 correct responses in 8 binary
trials) on at least 5 of the 6 contrasts. Post-alveolar consonant place was the contrast
most often failed.
Conclusions: When evaluated on a pass/fail basis, normally hearing children 3 years
of age or older are likely to demonstrate auditory perception of most phonemic
contrasts using this imitative test. Phonological development and other task-related
factors have only a modest effect on performance by normally hearing children after
3 years of age. The effects of hearing loss, hearing age, sensory assistance, and
listening experience in children with hearing loss remain to be determined.

he On-Line Imitative Test of Speech-Pattern Contrast Perception
(OlimSpac; Boothroyd, Eisenberg, & Martinez, 2006; Eisenberg,
Martinez, & Boothroyd, 2003, 2007) was developed as a tool for exploring auditory speech-perception capacity in children with hearing loss.
In young children, however, developmental and other task-related factors
can affect performance. The goal of the present study was to measure the
performance of normally hearing children on this test and to determine
the effects of age and contrast. The underlying premise was that normally
hearing children have, by definition, the auditory capacity needed to perceive all phonologically significant contrasts among speech sounds. Less
than perfect performance must, therefore, be attributed to the influence
of other factors. The results were intended to provide a frame of reference
against which to evaluate results obtained by children with hearing loss.

For present purposes, auditory capacity is defined as the ability of
the peripheral auditory system to deliver, to higher auditory centers,

patterns of neural excitation that convey consistent, detailed information about acoustic stimulus patterns. This
capacity may be qualified as unassisted, aided, or implanted. It may also be qualified in terms of the type of
acoustic stimulus. The present concern is with auditory
speech-perception capacity--that is, the ability of the
peripheral auditory system to deliver sufficient information for the detection of phonologically significant contrasts among the sound patterns of speech. We refer to
these as speech pattern contrasts. Auditory capacity involves a combination of audibility and suprathreshold
resolution. This study was concerned with the latter.
Note that auditory capacity, as the term is used here, is
different from auditory skill, which may be defined as
the ability to interpret and use the information made
available by auditory capacity.
There are several justifications for assessing auditory speech-perception capacity in young children with
hearing loss (Kirk, Diefendorf, Pisoni, & Robbins, 1997).
The information might be used, for example, to inform
decisions about the need for, choice of, and prescription
of sensory assistance (hearing aids and cochlear implants);
to guide the fitting of hearing aids and the mapping of
cochlear implants; to assess the outcome of sensory assistance; and to plan cognitive/linguistic intervention.
Unfortunately, capacity cannot be measured directly
with behavioral tests. Instead, it must be inferred from
performance. However, performance also depends on numerous other factors. Examples include auditory skill,
attention span, interest, fatigue, cooperation, motivation,
cognitive status, psychosocial development, and language
development. One way to address this problem is to
design tests in which task-related factors have little or
no effect--an approach that has a long tradition in psychophysical research (Werner & Rubel, 1992). In reality,
however, these factors can never be completely eliminated. As a result, one cannot confidently infer capacity
from performance until the latter has approached asymptote. This is a serious drawback for a test that might be
used for prescriptive or prognostic purposes.
Kirk et al. (1997) have offered an excellent review of
the many behavioral tests that have been developed for
assessing speech perception in children. Some involve
detection of minimal phonemic contrasts. Others require
word recognition in isolation or in sentences. Stimuli are
presented in open or closed sets, and responses include
conditioned head turns, pointing, button pushing, following instructions, and repetition. Because performance
is likely to be influenced by cognitive and /or linguistic
status, as well as by other task-related variables, the
minimum age at which these tests can be considered
suitable varies widely.
Among the response tasks used for assessing speech
perception in children with hearing loss, repetition and
imitation are regarded as suspect because they require

532

both phonological knowledge and motor-speech skill. On
the other hand, the imitative task is cognitively appropriate and familiar to young children, whereas nonspeech
response tasks often call for higher levels of cognitive
development and/or vocabulary knowledge. Moreover,
the effects of phonological development are virtually
impossible to eliminate in any test that uses speech
stimuli, even if no production is required.
The present article deals with a test in which the
perceptual task is the detection of phonemic contrasts,
and the response task is imitation. Performance is measured in terms of the child's ability to relay contrastive
information to a hearing adult who responds in a forcedchoice task. The original Imitative Test of Speech-Pattern
Contrast Perception (ImSpac) was one of a battery of tests
developed at the City University of New York for studies
of auditory capacity and performance in children who
use hearing aids and cochlear implants (Boothroyd, 1997a,
2009; Boothroyd & Eran, 1994; Boothroyd, Eran, & Hanin,
1996). There were several considerations behind the design of this test. First, as just pointed out, imitation is
natural and cognitively appropriate for young children
(Meltzoff, 2002). Second, the use of nonword utterances
reduces the effects of vocabulary and higher levels of language.1 Third, a forced-choice approach to evaluating
performance eliminates the need for the listener to make
judgments of accuracy or quality (Boothroyd, 1985). Fourth,
two or more binary contrasts can be evaluated at the
same time, thereby reducing testing time and the demands on attention and cooperation. Finally, performance
depends only on the child's ability to detect and convey
contrasts and not on the precision of phoneme production. In other words, he or she need not have fully mastered production of the speech sounds.
There were, however, two serious concerns with the
original ImSpac. First, off-line editing and judging of
recorded imitations (by teams of four paid listeners)
were too time-consuming and too expensive for clinical
application. This problem was addressed with an online procedure that involved masking a single listener
during stimulus presentation (Kosky & Boothroyd, 2003).
The approach was further refined at the House Ear Institute (HEI), leading to the on-line version of the test
(OlimSpac) used in the study to be described (Boothroyd
et al., 2006; Eisenberg et al., 2003, 2007).
The second concern was the possible influence of
phonological development and motor-speech skill. When
working with hearing-impaired children who have had
the opportunity to use their auditory capacity for the development of spoken language, it has been found that
We say "reduces" rather than "eliminates" because some nonwords may
be similar enough to real words to influence perception. Moreover, some
nonwords may have real words embedded in them, as was the case in the
present study.

performance is usually better with audio-visual than
with audio-only models (Boothroyd, 1998; Boothroyd &
Boothroyd-Turner, 2002; Boothroyd et al., 1996).2 From
this, it has been concluded that the audio-alone score
in these children is not being limited by motor-speech skill;
they demonstrated that they could perform better when
given more sensory input. There was, however, no guarantee that audio-only or audio-visual performance had
reached the highest levels of which the child was capable. The potential influence of phonological and motorspeech development remains a concern.3
Before rejecting the imitative approach, however, it
is appropriate to ask what the contributions of phonological development, motor-speech skill, and other taskrelated factors might be in normally hearing, normally
developing children. We begin with the premise that these
children can be assumed to have normal auditory speechperception capacity and to have used this capacity for
phonological development. If these assumptions are true,
any deficits in performance must be attributed to one or
more of the task-related factors discussed earlier. Specifically, age effects implicate development in a general
sense, whereas contrast effects and Age x Contrast interactions implicate phonological development in particular. As indicated earlier, the data can provide a frame of
reference against which to interpret results obtained
from young children with hearing loss. They also provide
a test of our ability to make inferences about perception
capacity from measures of imitation performance.
In carrying out this research, we sought answers to
two questions:
1.

2.

By what age should we expect normally hearing children to demonstrate, in this imitative task, the ability to detect and convey phonologically significant
speech pattern contrasts?
Does this age depend on the contrast?

Method
Participants
Thirty-four children participated in this study. All
had hearing thresholds within normal limits at octave
intervals from 250 to 8000 Hz. English was the first or
only language, and there were no known developmental
delays. Seven of the children were hearing siblings of
hearing-impaired children attending the Children's Auditory Research and Evaluation Center at the HEI.
Eight were children of HEI employees. Thirteen were

the children of friends of HEI employees. Six were not
otherwise associated with HEI.
Four children were unable or unwilling to perform
the imitative task. Their ages ranged from 1;10 ( years;
months) to 2;10. This left 30 children for whom performance data were obtained. The ages of these 30 children
ranged from 2;7 to 6;7, with a mean of 4;2. Fourteen were
boys, and 16 were girls. Participation was by parental
informed consent and child assent. Information on age,
gender, HEI connection, and race/ethnicity are included
with performance results in Table 1.

Speech Stimuli
The stimuli to be imitated consisted of vowel-
consonant-vowel (VCV) utterances. Medial placement
of the consonant was used to provide the child with both
pre- and postvocalic coarticulatory cues. Productions of
the stimuli by a female talker were video recorded using
studio-quality digital equipment and a lavaliere microphone. Individual VCVs were extracted and edited for
incorporation into the test software. The video properties were 30 frames per second with 24-bit color resolution and a display of 720 x 480 pixels. The Cinepak Codec
was used for file compression, and the resulting video
clips were saved as .avi files. The audio signals were extracted from the video clips and saved separately as .wav
files. Audio properties were 44,100 samples per second
with 16-bit resolution. One of the stereo channels was
replaced with a speech-shaped random noise that coincided with the utterances and was used to mask the
tester/listener during stimulus presentation to the child.

Software
The OlimSpac software provides three options for
stimulus presentation: visual-only, audio-only, and audiovisual (Boothroyd et al., 2006). Figure 1 shows a typical
test setup. The video signal is presented to the child via
a slave monitor. The audio signal is presented via headphones or loudspeaker. Two types of stimuli are available:
the VCV utterances described earlier, and consonant-
vowel utterances produced by a different female talker
and used in an earlier pilot study (Eisenberg et al., 2003).
During stimulus presentation, the tester is prevented
from hearing the audio stimulus by the masking noise
described earlier. The tester is also prevented from seeing the video stimulus by covering that part of the monitor showing the talker's face. The child's imitation is
relayed to the tester, at which time the audio masking
has ended.4 The tester is presented with eight alternatives,
4
During formative evaluation, we found it necessary to terminate the
audio portion of the final vowel, and the accompanying masking noise, after
about 300 ms. This was done to deal with the problem of eager children who
began their imitation before the utterance and, therefore, the noise were
finished, making it impossible for the tester to hear the full response.

Note. Scores for individual contrasts are the number of correct binary responses in eight trials. Composite scores are in percentage correct after
correction for guessing, using Equation 1. ID = identification; Race/ethnicity: W = White/non-Hispanic (n = 20), A = Asian (n = 2), B = Black (n = 2),
H = White/Hispanic (n = 6); Gender: F = female (n = 16), M = male (n = 14); House Ear Institute (HEI) connection: a = child of HEI employee (n = 8), b = child
of friend of HEI employee (n = 10), c = sibling of HEI patient (n = 6), d = none (n = 6); VH = vowel height; VP = vowel place; CV = consonant voicing;
CC = consonant continuance; CPf = pre-alveolar consonant place; CPr = post-alveolar consonant place; re. = relative to.

as illustrated in Figure 2, and is required to indicate
which one the child is thought to be imitating, guessing if
not sure. Each of the tester's responses provides information on three binary contrasts. A set of eight trials is
used for three contrasts. A second set of eight trials is
used for three different contrasts, giving six contrasts in
all. Two of the six are vowel contrasts, and four are consonant contrasts, reflecting the higher importance of
consonants in speech perception. Among the consonant
contrasts, place of articulation is represented twice, reflecting its higher importance in consonant recognition.
The six contrasts are as follows:

534

1.

Vowel height (VH; e.g., "oodoo" vs. "aadaa"),

2.

Consonant voicing (CV; e.g., "aataa" or "aapaa" vs.
"aadaa" or "aabaa"),

3.

Pre-alveolar consonant place (CPf; e.g., "oopoo" or
"ooboo" vs. "ootoo" or "oodoo"),

4.

Vowel place (VP; e.g., "ootoo" vs. "eetee"),

5.

Consonant continuance (CC; e.g., "eetee" or "eechee"
vs. "eesee" or "eeshee"), and

6.

Post-alveolar consonant place (CPr; e.g., "oosoo" or
"ootoo" vs. "ooshoo" or "oochoo").

The qualifiers front and rear for the consonant place
contrasts refer to pre- and post-alveolar place. Note that
the scores are based only on the contrast and not on its
phonemic context. In the case of CV, for example, if the
target consonant is voiced, any voiced consonant is scored
correct for voicing, even if it is the wrong one. This is an
important feature of the test. The child does not need to
be imitating a speech sound perfectly to be scored correct
on a specific contrast.

Figure 2. Eight response alternatives presented to the tester/listener
for the first trial of three contrasts: vowel place (VP), consonant
continuance (CC), and post-alveolar consonant place (CPr). The
scores shown at the bottom are for the previous three contrasts: vowel
height (VH), consonant voicing (CV), and pre-alveolar consonant
place (CPf).

The software provides four test forms in which the
utterances embodying the contrasts and/or the order of
presentation of the contrasts are changed. The score for
a single contrast and a single presentation modality is
based on eight binary trials with an expected score of
four if the tester is guessing at random. A score of seven
or eight is significantly better than chance at the .035
level (on the basis of the true binomial distribution). For
this reason, the score of a single child on a single contrast
is best thought of as pass/fail rather than as a parametric measure of proficiency. Increasing the number of
trials would increase the precision of assessment but
at the expense of testing time and the likelihood that a
young child will not complete the test. The composite
score, averaged across the six contrasts, is, however,
based on a total of 48 trials and may be treated as a
parametric index of overall performance.
Testing via a single presentation modality requires
16 trials and usually takes less than 5 min. Although the
visual-only modality is available, testing is generally
limited to two modalities: audio-visual and audio-only.
The audio-visual condition is usually presented first.
This provides training for the audio-only condition--
familiarizing the child with the task and the talker. It
can also serve as a screening test. If the child cannot
perform under the audio-visual condition or if he or she
scores at chance levels, there is little point in continuing

with the audio-only condition. If the audio-visual score is
significantly better than the audio-only score, one can
conclude that audio-only performance is not being limited by motor-speech skill.

Procedure
In the present study, testing took place in a soundattenuating enclosure with a parent and a researcher
present. The tester remained outside the room, controlled
stimulus presentation, and scored the responses. Sound
stimuli were delivered at an average level of 70 dBA via
loudspeaker. Each child was given an explanation and
demonstration of what was required. Once it was clear
that he or she understood the task and was prepared to
participate, formal testing began. Only the VCV stimuli
were used. Testing began with audio-visual presentation,
followed by audio-only. Because form equivalence had
not been established, testing was limited to the first of
the four forms. For each presentation modality, the contrasts of VH, CV, and CPf were tested in the first eight
trials. The contrasts of VP, CC, and CPr were tested in
the second eight trials. As a reward, regardless of participation in the test, all children chose a small toy from a
"treasure" chest and were also compensated with $10.

The best-fit parameters (1 SE) were as follows:
Audio-visual: a = 97% (1.9), b = 27 months (1.7),
c = 4.3 months (1.3)
Audio-only: a = 99% (2.1), b = 22 months (3.4), c = 7.6
months (2.3)

Results
Raw Data
Table 1 shows the number of correct listener judgments in eight trials for each child and each contrast
under both audio-visual and audio-only conditions. Also
shown are composite percentage correct scores. These
were averaged across the six contrasts and were corrected for guessing using the following formula:
c 1/4 r  g=100  g  100;

1

where c = corrected score in percentage, r = raw score in
percentage, and g = expected guessing score (in this case,
50%). Also shown in Table 1 are the demographic data
mentioned earlier.

Main Effects of Age
and Presentation Modality
Figure 3 shows the composite corrected scores as a
function of age and presentation modality. Also shown
are least squares fits of an exponential growth function
to the data. The function is as follows:
y 1/4 af1  e1/2xb=c g;

2

where y = predicted score, a = asymptote, e = base of
natural logarithms, x = age, b = age at which score first
rises above zero, and c = a growth constant.

show composite scores averaged across six contrasts and corrected
for guessing. Lines are least-squares fits of exponential growth
functions to the data. The ages are also shown for the four children
for whom testing was unsuccessful.

The variance accounted for by these nonlinear functions was 60% and 65% for audio-only and audio-visual
presentation, respectively. As one might expect from these
data, a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
in the arcsine transforms of the corrected percentage correct scores failed to show a significant effect of presentation modality, F(1, 29) = 0.002, p = .97. Because so many
of the older children scored 100%, the test was repeated
for the 15 children who were younger than 4 years of
age. Again, there was no evidence of an effect of modality,
F(1, 14) = 0.84, p = .37.
From these data, we conclude that composite performance, averaged over six contrasts, improved with age,
that growth was virtually complete by 4 years of age, and
that there was no evidence of deterioration in performance
when testing switched from audio-visual to audio-only.

Effects of Demographic Variables
As in many studies of this type, the participant
sample was one of convenience, leading to the possibility
that age and contrast effects might be confounded with
the effects of demographic variables. Because all children had English as their first language, there was no a
priori reason to expect an effect of race/ethnicity. A gender effect is always a possibility, however, especially

when developmental factors are involved. Furthermore,
the associations of most of the children with the HEI
might lead one to suspect an influence of enhanced spokenlanguage input and, perhaps, socioeconomic status.
The three panels of Figure 4 show the distributions
of audio-only composite scores divided according to the
three demographic factors. The top panel shows division
by race/ethnicity (White/non-Hispanic vs. other). The center panel shows division by gender, and the bottom panel
shows division by HEI connection. In no case is there obvious evidence that the two groups differed significantly.
This observation was supported by three separate oneway ANOVAs in the arcsine-transformed data using age
as a covariate: for race/ethnicity, F(1, 27) = 0.15, p = .71;
for gender, F(1, 27) = 0.41, p = .53; for HEI connection,
F(1, 27) = 2.35, p = .14. Interestingly, a one-way analysis
of the HEI-connection data without the covariate of age
showed significantly better performance by the children
without an HEI connection; however, this was clearly

three demographic variables. In separate one-way analyses of
variance with age as a covariate, there was no evidence of significant
effects. HEI = House Ear Institute.

attributable to there being no children younger than 3;6
in this group.
The data provide no evidence of an effect of these
three demographic variables on the ability of young normally hearing children to convey phonetic contrasts by
imitation of auditory patterns. They do not, however,
rule out the possibility that such effects might be demonstrated in studies with larger, carefully selected samples.

Effect of Contrast
To examine differences between contrasts and potential Age x Contrast interactions, the children were divided into five age groups, as shown in Table 1. The
groups consisted of the 6-month range from 2;6 to 3;0,
the 6-month range from 3;1 to 3;6, the 6-month range
from 3;7 to 4;0, the 1-year range from 4;1 to 5;0, and the
2-year range from 5;1 to 7;0. Contrast scores were corrected for guessing, expressed in percentage, arcsine
transformed to increase homogeneity of variance, and
subjected to a repeated-measures ANOVA. The betweengroups variable was age group at five levels. The withinsubject variable was contrast at six levels. The main
effect of age was highly significant, F(4, 25) = 12.7,
p < .000005, as was the effect of contrast, F(5, 125) =
12.7, p < .000005. There was also a significant Age x
Contrast interaction, F(5, 125) = 1.9, p = .016. Because
of the high number of perfect scores, the assumption of
homogeneity of variance was violated. Multivariate analysis, using the Wilks's lambda statistic, however, confirmed the findings--albeit with fewer degrees of freedom
and, consequently, somewhat higher probability levels.
Figure 5 illustrates the Age x Contrast interaction. The curves were obtained by least squares fits of

functions to the data. re = regarding; Cons. = consonant.

Equation 2 to individual data for the audio-only condition. It can be seen that the differences among the contrasts are large for the younger participants but diminish
with increasing age as the curves approach asymptote.
The age at which mean performance reaches 90% is less
than 3 years for the contrasts of VH, VP, and CPf; is
around 3;6 for CV and CC; and is around 4 years for CPr.
Contrast-dependence of the age effect supports the conclusion that phonological development is a contributing
factor.

Individual Data for
Audio-Only Presentation
The results presented so far represent mean data for
this sample of participants. The statistical analyses have
been used to make inferences about the average performance in the population of normally hearing children
from which these 30 participants are assumed to have
been randomly selected. However, if OlimSpac is to have
clinical value as an index of auditory capacity, we must

be able to draw conclusions from the data for a single
participant and a single contrast.
Figure 6 shows individual audio-only data for the six
contrasts as a function of age. Unlike the earlier data,
these results are shown as the number of correct responses
in eight trials. Also shown is the passing criterion of seven
or eight correct responses. As indicated earlier, the probability of seven or eight correct responses in eight binary
trials, if the listener is responding at random, is .035.
Scores failing to meet this criterion are shown with filled
symbols. The following points should be noted:
1.

Among the 30 children who completed the test, all
obtained passing scores on the two vowel contrasts.

2.

Only one child failed on CPf. This child was 2;9 of
age.

3.

One child (a different child) failed on CV. This child
was 2;10 of age.

4.

Four children failed on CC. The oldest was 3;6 of
age.

sense, to what extent can we use production as an indicator of perception?

6.

Every child 3 years of age or more obtained a passing
score on at least five of the six contrasts.

It would appear from these data that the probability
of participation in this imitative test is high once a child
reaches 3 years of age. This probability falls with decreasing age less than 3 years. Even after 3 years of age,
mean performance improves measurably, at least up to
4 years of age. The age effect implicates developmental
factors but tells us nothing about which factors are responsible. We do, however, exclude emerging auditory
capacity. We began with the premise that auditory speechperception capacity in hearing children is normal--a premise supported by evidence that children as young as
3 months of age respond to acoustic differences that are
finer than those responsible for phonemic contrasts in
their native language (Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens,
& Lindblom, 1992).

This last point is made more explicit in Figure 7,
which shows the number of contrasts passed as a function
of age. Data are shown for both audio-only and audiovisual presentations. Of the 26 children 3 years of age or
older, all completed the test, and all obtained passing
scores on at least five of the six contrasts--regardless of
presentation modality. With only one exception, the failed
contrast was CPr.

Discussion
This study was not intended to provide definitive
information on the phonological development in normally hearing children. Its purpose was to explore the
effects of normal maturation and phonological development on performance on a specific test. We set out to
answer three questions. By what age should we expect
normally hearing children to demonstrate, in this imitative task, the ability to detect and convey phonologically significant speech pattern contrasts? Does this age
depend on the contrast? Furthermore, in a more general

Figure 7. The number of contrasts on which each child's imitation
was scored correctly seven or eight times in eight trials. Every child
3 years of age or older passed on at least five of the six contrasts
used in OlimSpac, regardless of presentation modality. Overlapping
data points have been moved slightly to ensure visibility.

We also exclude the effect of cognitive development.
This conclusion is based on the fact that performance on
the VP contrast was perfect for all children who completed the test. It was clear that these children understood what was required. Among the four children who
did not take the test, we do not know whether they were
unwilling or unable.
The main effect of contrast and the Age x Contrast
interaction implicate phonological development. There
are two possible reasons that the vowel scores were almost perfect for the younger children. First, vowel articulation is mastered early in development. Second, the
vowel contrasts used here were extreme, crossing at least
two phoneme categories. Note, however, that performance
on the minimal-pair contrast of CPf was also near-perfect.
This contrast was represented by the sounds /p/, /b/, /t/,
and /d/. According to Smit, Hand, Freilinger, Bernthal,
and Bird (1990), 75% of normally developing children
master these consonants before 3 years of age. It seems
likely, therefore, that phonological development is more
important than the magnitude of the contrasts. This conclusion is supported by the poor performance on CPr. In
this case, two of the sounds used to represent the contrast
(/sh/ and /ch/) are not mastered by 75% of normally developing children until 4 or 5 years of age (Smit et al., 1990).
It is possible that fatigue, boredom, and inattention
influenced results and that these factors became less
serious with increasing age; however, we have no way
of exploring this possibility. It should be pointed out,
however, that the time taken for the test is very short,
around 5 min, and imitation is a familiar activity for
developing children. Moreover, because the audio-only
condition is always presented first, any fatigue effect
would have shown up as an apparent modality effect--
for which we found no evidence.
The absence of a significant difference between imitation of audio-visual and audio-only models is counter

to findings obtained when using this test procedure with
hearing-impaired children (Boothroyd & BoothroydTurner, 2002; Boothroyd et al., 1996; Eisenberg et al.,
2003). Although visual information can be important
in normal phonological development, it is probable that
children with hearing loss, if acquiring spoken-language
competence, place more reliance on visual cues. Less easily explained is the fact that Hnath-Chisolm, Laippley,
and Boothroyd (1998) did find a visual enhancement effect in normally hearing children as young as 4 years of
age. In that study, however, a three-interval, forced-choice
test was used (Boothroyd, 1997b). This test was both boring and cognitively demanding, and the audio-only scores
of the younger children were low enough to leave room
for visual enhancement. Average performance in the present study was close to 100% by 4 years of age, leaving little
or no room for demonstration of a visual enhancement
effect even if it was present. Of course, failure to demonstrate a statistically significant effect does not mean
that none exists or that one could not be demonstrated
with more extensive testing and a larger sample size. To
explore this issue further, we examined the audio-visual
minus audio-only difference for the 15 children younger
than 4 years of age. The mean difference in composite
score, after correction for guessing, was 0.56 percentage
points. The standard error was 2.07 percentage points.
For 14 degrees of freedom, a t value of 2.14 is required
for 95% confidence in a two-tailed test. From these data,
we conclude that the design was capable of demonstrating an effect of medium size (Cohen's d = 0.55). As pointed
out previously, had we found a significant modality effect, we would not have been able to distinguish this
from an effect of fatigue or loss of attention. Note, however, that visual enhancement was not the focus of this
study. The audio-visual condition was used here for training and screening.
One concern about this test procedure is the potential role of the tester/listener. The results of the OlimSpac
depend on the ability of this individual to maintain attention and to make rapid judgments on the basis of the
often immature productions of young children. Had different listeners been used for different children, there
would have been the opportunity for confounding listener differences with the effects of age. In this study,
however, all the children were judged by the same listener. Note, also, that the forced-choice task is intended
to minimize the effect of listener differences (Boothroyd,
1985). It has yet to be determined whether inter-listener
differences have a significant effect on results obtained
with OlimSpac.
It should be noted that the option "none of the above"
was not available to the tester, even if she could not
identify the child's imitation or identified it as something other than one of the eight alternatives available.
We stress again, however, that the purpose of this test

540

is to measure the child's ability to convey contrastive
information--not to match phonemic targets. It may
well be that the tester will correctly respond with a
voiced consonant, for example, even if it is the wrong one.
Moreover, the requirement of the null hypothesis is that
responses are made at random and not withheld.
The study was not designed to investigate effects
other than age and contrast, and the sample was one of
convenience. It did, however, provide an opportunity
to look for evidence of other effects. Because English as
a first or sole language was a criterion for inclusion,
there was no a priori reason to expect an effect of race/
ethnicity, and none was observed. We might have expected a gender effect because girls are known to develop
articulation skills somewhat more rapidly than do boys
(Smit et al., 1990). Again, however, the data do not demonstrate a gender effect. Most of the participants were
associated in some way with the HEI, and it has been
suggested that this might bias the results toward better
performance because of parental awareness of the value
of an enriched spoken language environment, their socioeconomic status, their educational level, or some combination of these. There was, however, no evidence for such
an effect. The failure to find evidence of these effects does
not mean, of course, that they do not exist. However, a
more powerful design would be needed to explore this
possibility. From the one-way ANOVAs in the arcsine
transforms of the audio-only composite scores reported
earlier, it was determined that the current design was
only capable of detecting, at the 95% level of confidence,
large or very large effects (Cohen's d = 0.95, 0.79, and
2.07 for the binary classifications of race, gender, and
HEI connection, respectively).
The original purpose of this imitative test was to
provide clinically useful information about the auditory
speech-perception capacity of children with hearing
impairment. It has always been recognized that if auditory capacity is to be inferred from imitative performance,
two conditions must be satisfied. First, the child has had
every opportunity to use hearing in the development of
auditory and spoken language skills. Second, performance
has approached an asymptote. We assume that, by definition, normally hearing children meet the first condition. The cross-sectional data from the present study
suggest that the second condition is met in normally
hearing children by around 3 years of age, after which
the various task-related factors listed in the introduction have a relatively small effect. When working with
children who have hearing loss, however, it is seldom
possible to determine how well either of these conditions
is met. Moreover, it is not clear which of the potential
task-related factors will be primarily a function of chronological age and which will be a function of hearing age
(i.e., the length of time since the child was provided with
sensory assistance). A single performance measure on

the audio-only portion of this test can only be taken, therefore, as a lower estimate of auditory speech-perception
capacity. In other words, the capacity is not poorer than
that indicated but could possibly be better. Repeated testing over time will help determine whether a performance
asymptote has been approached (Boothroyd, 2009). As indicated in the introduction, the requirement for repeated
testing severely restricts the test's value as a predictive or
prognostic tool. Nevertheless, the test may still have value
as a measure of performance, progress, and outcome, especially if used as one component of a battery of tests.
The test may also provide useful information on phonological development. Support for this suggestion comes
from a study in which scores on OlimSpac have been
shown to have predictive value in relation to higher levels
of spoken language acquisition in children with hearing
loss (DesJardin, Ambrose, Martinez, & Eisenberg, 2009).
We do not, at the time of writing, have a direct measure of auditory capacity in young children that can be
used as a validating criterion for behavioral tests. There
has, however, been preliminary work on the development
of electrophysiological techniques. Much of this work has
focused on the acoustic change complex, which is a response to change during an ongoing sound stimulus (Brown
et al., 2008; Martin, 2007; Martin, Ali, Leach-Berth, &
Boothroyd, in press; Martin & Boothroyd, 1999, 2000;
Ostroff, Martin, & Boothroyd, 1999). In the future, it
may be possible to measure auditory speech-perception
capacity electrophysiologically before a child has developed auditory and spoken language skills. In the meantime, we must rely on behavioral tests while recognizing
and accounting for their limitations.

Conclusions
We reached the following conclusions from this study:
1.

Although the OlimSpac, as implemented in this
study, is cognitively appropriate for normally developing children as young as 2;7, there is a high probability of nonparticipation in children younger than
3 years of age.

2.

After 3 years of age, participation is probable, but
the performance of normally hearing children is
likely to improve with age and to vary with contrast.

3.

The contrast effect and the Age x Contrast interaction implicate phonological development as a factor.

4.

Nevertheless, after 3 years of age, the combined
effect of phonological development and other taskrelated factors on performance is relatively small.

5.

Using a passing criterion of seven correct responses
in eight trials, it is highly probable that a normally
developing child, 3 years of age or older, will obtain

a passing score on at least five of the six contrasts
used here.
6.

The contrast most likely to be failed is that of CPr.

The effects of age, hearing loss, sensory assistance,
phonological development, and task-related factors on
the performance of children with hearing loss have yet to
be determined. We can say with reasonable confidence,
however, that poor performance on this test by a child
with hearing loss who is younger than 3 years of age
should not be attributed solely to poor auditory capacity.
