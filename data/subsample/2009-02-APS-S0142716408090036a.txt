ABSTRACT
The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which bilingual speakers maintain languagespecific phonological contrasts for homorganic stops when a cue is shared across both languages.
To this end, voice onset time (VOT) was investigated in three groups of participants: early bilinguals
speakers of Canadian French and Canadian English (n = 8), monolingual speakers of Canadian English
(n = 8), and monolingual speakers of Canadian French (n = 7). Three questions were targeted: What
are the general patterns of VOT production in bilingual and monolinguals? Do bilingual speakers
produce different mean VOT than monolinguals? Do bilingual speakers produce different variability
in VOT than monolinguals? Acoustic measurements of VOT were made from monosyllabic English
and French words with word-initial bilabial or coronal stop consonants. The results indicate that the
early bilingual speakers maintain monolingual-like phonemic contrasts, but that they exhibit more
variation within categories than monolingual speakers.

The goal of the present study is to investigate the extent to which bilingual speakers
can produce nativelike speech in two languages. Rather than study individuals
who learned their second language (L2) during late childhood, the bilinguals
included in this study are highly proficient bilingual speakers of Canadian English
and Canadian French who acquired these two languages simultaneously or as
toddlers. These bilingual speakers will be compared to monolingual speakers of
both languages and their use of voice onset time (VOT) to contrast homorganic
stops will be compared. The following paragraphs provide information about stop
production across languages, the specific contrasts that occur in Canadian English
and Canadian French, and a review of a model for bilingual speech production.
Cross-linguistically, stop consonants vary in a number of parameters including
the number of stop consonants that contrast in the language, the place of articulation, the laryngeal features associated with production of the stops, and onset

of voicing relative to the release of the articulators (i.e., VOT). In their influential
acoustic study, Lisker and Abramson (1964) first identified the parameter of VOT
as a primary cue used by languages to contrast stop consonants that share the
same place of articulation. Research has shown that languages use three or fewer
values of VOT to distinguish homorganic stops: lead VOT, associated with negative values, short-lag VOT, associated with small positive values, and long-lag
VOT, associated with larger positive values (Cho & Ladefoged, 1999; Lisker &
Abramson, 1964).
Lead VOT, short-lag VOT, and long-lag VOT are important in distinguishing
homorganic stop consonants in Canadian English (CE) and Canadian French (CF).
As with English spoken in the United States and England, voiced stops of CE tend
to have short-lag voicing, with values typically between 0 ms and 20 ms; voiceless
stops are produced with long-lag voicing, with VOT values typically between 65
and 150 ms (Auzou et al., 2000; Caramazza, Yeni-Komshian, Zurif, & Carbone,
1973; Kessinger & Blumstein, 1997; Lisker & Abramson, 1964; Macken & Barton,
1979; Ryalls, Zipprer, & Basldauff, 1997; Sundara, 2005). As with French spoken
in France, the voiced stops of CF tend to have lead voicing, typically resulting
in negative values between -200 and -50 ms; and the CF voiceless stops tend
to have short-lag voicing with values typically between 0 and 40 ms (Kessinger
& Blumstein, 1997; Ryalls, Cliche, Fortier-Blanc, Colombe, & Prud'Hommeaux,
1997; Sundara, 2005). As a result, the short-lag stops in English and French are
associated with different phonological categories, with "voiced" stops in CE (i.e.,
/b/ "beg," /d/ "dog," and /g/ "got") and "voiceless" stops in CF (i.e., /p/ "pere"
father, /t/ "table" table, and /k/ "coude" elbow).
The phonetic and phonological characteristics of bilingual speech production
have been explicitly discussed within the speech learning model (SLM) proposed
by Flege (1995). This model emerged from adult L2 learning research to account
for age-related limits on the ability to produce L2 vowels and consonants in
a nativelike way. Flege (1995) proposed that L2 speakers fail to perceive the
phonetic differences between pairs of L2 sounds for two reasons: the pair of L2
sounds are assimilated to a single native-language phonetic categories; or the
phonology of the native language filters out properties of the L2 sounds that are
important for phonetic discrimination. Based on SLM, nativelike L2 production
requires three main components: (a) an accurate perception of the properties that
differentiate L2 sounds from one another, and from sounds in the L1; (b) the
storing and structuring of this information in a person's long-term memory; and
(c) the learning of the articulations required to reliably and accurately produce
L2 sounds. From these three components, Flege proposed seven hypotheses form
the SLM of L2 acquisition; two of these hypotheses can be applied to the current
study.
The first hypothesis states that there is a perceptual relationship between the
sounds in a speaker's first language (L1) and L2. This relationship is described as
"allophonic" and "sensitive to the syllable position of the sound" (Flege, 1995).
Applying this hypothesis to the stops of CE and CF is not straightforward. It may
be that bilingual speakers group the voiced stops of the two languages in a single
category with VOT in the prevoiced range occurring as the allophone for CF, and
short-lag VOTs as the allophone for CE. In this case, one might expect greater

55

variability in VOT values for bilinguals as their allophones cover a wide range
of VOTs. Another possibility is that the bilingual speakers form three perceptual
categories for voicing: prevoiced (for /b, d, g/ in CF) short-lag stops (/p, t, k/
in CF; /b, d, g/ in CE), and long-lag (/p, t, k/ in CE). In this case, it would
be expected that bilingual speakers of CE and CF would show overlap in VOT
values of CE /b, d/ and CF /p, t/, whereas productions of /p, t/ in CE and /b, d/
in CF would be distinct. The second hypothesis states that phonetically similar
sounds from the L1 and L2 are more likely to be distinguished when the L2
is learned at a younger age. Predictions of this hypothesis are straightforward:
by definition, "early" bilinguals are exposed to both languages at a young age,
and thus, according to Flege, should have established phonemic categories for
each stop in each language. Consequently, their stops productions would exhibit
monolingual-like VOT in both languages as measured by mean and standard
deviation. These two hypotheses will be explored in this study.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH

The production of VOT has been studied in many languages, with contrasting
pairs of homorganic stops including Dutch (Van Alphen & Smits, 2004), English
(Kessinger & Blumstein, 1997; Ryalls et al. 1997), French (Fougeron, 2001;
Kessinger & Blumstein, 1997; Sundara, 2005), Spanish (Magloire & Green, 1999),
and German (Haag, 1979); and in languages with more than two contrasting
homorganic stops such as Korean (Cho, Jun, & Ladefoged, 2002), Thai (Gandour
& Dardarandanda, 1984; Kessinger & Blumstein, 1997), and Hindi (Davis, 1995).
Few studies have investigated the production of VOT by bilingual speakers of two
languages using different VOT values to contrast homorganic stops (e.g., Spanish
vs. English, or French vs. English).
Four studies have investigated the production of VOT in bilingual speakers of
English and French who have learned their two languages during childhood. In the
1970s, Caramazza and colleagues (1973) analyzed VOT of bilabial, coronal, and
velar stops produced by bilingual speakers of CE and CF, and in the 1990s, Hazan
and Boulakia (1993) investigated VOT of bilabial stops in the speech of British
English and Continental French. More recently, MacLeod and Stoel-Gammon
(2005) reported preliminary findings of early bilinguals' production of VOT for
labial and coronal stops, and Sundara, Polka, and Baum (2006) explored how
simultaneous bilinguals speakers of CE and CF produced VOT of coronal stops.
The results from these four studies shaped the current research questions and are
reviewed in detail below.
In their seminal study, Caramazza and colleagues (1973) investigated how
bilingual and monolingual speakers of CE and CF speakers produced and perceived
VOT by testing bilingual CE-CF participants, and monolingual participants in a
speech production and a speech perception task. The 20 bilingual subjects were
all native speakers of French from Ottawa, Canada, who had begun to learn CE
by the age of 7 years; their bilingual proficiency was self-assessed using a 7-point
scale and a reading rate that exceeded 180 words per minute, reported to be an
effective measure of bilingualism (Macnamara, 1969). The bilingual participants
were tested in two separate sessions, one for each language, and by different

56

experimenters in each session. The participants read a word list consisting of
stop-initial words from the targeted language of the session and completed a
VOT identification task. For production, VOT was measured using wideband
spectrograms created from the audio recordings.
Caramazza et al. (1973) found that the CE monolingual speakers produced
distinct VOT distributions for the voicing contrast at the three places of articulation
(bilabial, coronal, velar); thus, at each place of articulation the short-lag stop did
not overlap with the long-lag stop. In contrast, the monolingual CF speakers
were found to have overlapping distributions at each place of articulation, the
"voiced" stop was produced with both lead VOT and short-lag VOT, and the
"voiceless" stop was produced with short-lag VOT. Based on this finding, the
authors suggested that VOT was a primary cue for voicing distinctions in CE but
not for CF. The bilingual speakers exhibited overlap in their VOT distributions
for each stop contrast in CF, which resembled the VOT distributions of the CF
monolingual speakers in the study; in CE, the bilingual speakers showed a clear
separation of voiced and voiceless stops, which was similar to the distinction in
productions of CE monolingual speakers. The researchers reported unidirectional
interference of CF on CE in both production and perception of VOT, likely because
of the fact that the bilinguals learned CE later in childhood. Although the bilinguals
produced distinct VOTs for the voiced and voiceless cognates of CE, they produced
less separation than that observed in monolingual CE speakers. The bilinguals
maintained language distinctions in VOT by increasing the amount of voicing
lag for voiceless stops in English. However, Caramazza and colleagues (1973)
did not conduct statistical analysis on the productions of voiced stops in either
CE or CF, because of "clearly bimodal, in fact discontinuous, distributions of
the voiced stops" (Caramazza et al., 1973, p. 425). The authors did not report
how frequently a voiced stop was produced with lead VOT or short-lag VOT, but
instead provided an illustration of the distributions in both CE and CF. Based
on visual inspection of this illustration (figure 4 of Caramazza et al., 1973), the
bilinguals appeared to produce similar frequency of lead VOT and short-lag VOT
for /b, d, g/ in CE and CF. The results from Caramazza et al. (1973) indicate that
monolingual English speakers use VOT as a cue to voicing to a greater extent than
the monolingual French speakers. The bilingual speakers showed a unidirectional
influence of French on English that was especially apparent in their production
of voiced stops with prevoicing in both English and French. This unidirectional
influence is likely due to having learned English as an L2 by the age of 7 years.
Hazan and Boulakia (1993) investigated the production of VOT in bilabial
stops by monolingual and bilingual speakers of British English and Continental
French. As with English and French spoken in Canada, British English and Continental French speakers use VOT to contrast homorganic stops: British English
contrast short- and long-lag VOT, whereas Continental French contrasts lead VOT
and short-lag VOT. Hazan and Boulakia (1993) collected data from four groups
of participants: 12 bilinguals living in Paris, 9 bilinguals living in London, 11
British monolinguals, and 13 French monolinguals. The bilinguals were defined
by their age of L2 acquisition, before or after the age of 5 years; their degree of
bilingualism, established using listener rating of accent on specific sentences; and
their language dominance, established using responses to a questionnaire. The

bilingual participants were tested on separate days by a bilingual experimenter
using one language throughout each session; the monolinguals were tested in single sessions. Ten target words with bilabial stops in initial position were elicited
using in a short carrier phrase for each speaker. VOT was measured from digitized
waveforms. Even though productions of /b/ had a somewhat bimodal distribution
(i.e., the presence of negative VOT values and small positive VOT values within
a category), Hazan and Boulakia (1993) conducted a statistical analysis to test
group differences in VOT values of the voiced and voiceless labial stops. From
this analysis, the authors concluded that the monolingual speakers of both English
and French produced distinct VOT distributions for the voicing contrast at the
bilabial place of articulation. However, unlike the bilinguals in the Caramazza
study, the French-dominant bilinguals were found to produce /p/ in English with
a significantly shorter VOT than monolingual English speakers. The same group
of French-dominant bilinguals in this study produced significantly more frequent
lead voicing of /b/ in English, a result that concurs with the findings of Caramazza
et al. (1973). Regardless of language dominance, speakers exhibited some lead
voicing when producing /b/ in English, although this phenomenon occurred less
frequently for the English-dominant group (23.9%) than the French-dominant
group (early learners of English = 69%, late learners of English = 75%). Based
on their findings, Hazan and Boulakia (1993) propose that bilingual speakers
produce a voicing pattern in their L2 that is based on the voicing pattern of their
L1, despite proficiency in an L2.
MacLeod and Stoel-Gammon (2005) provided preliminary findings from their
study of VOT production of labial and coronal stops by early bilingual speakers of
CE and CF. The three bilingual participants were exposed to CE and CF prior to
the age of 3 years, they used both languages during their education, and continued
to use both languages at least 50% of the time in two of three contexts of home,
leisure, or work (or school). The bilinguals were compared to three monolingual
speakers of CE and three monolingual speakers of CF. The bilingual participants
were tested by a bilingual speaker in two sessions: one in CE, the other in CF.
Participants were recorded producing monosyllabic words with labial or coronal
stops in word initial position in a carrier phrase for each language.
MacLeod and Stoel-Gammon (2005) reported that the bilingual speakers produced phonemically distinct stops in both languages, although some overlap between voicing categories was observed. When compared to monolingual speakers,
the bilingual speakers produced VOT that was not significantly different from
monolingual CF speakers in either mean or standard deviation. In CE, the bilinguals' productions were not significantly different from monolingual CE speakers
in mean or standard deviation for voiceless tokens; however, their VOT values for
voiced stops were significantly different from monolingual CE speakers because of
occurrences of prevoiced tokens. The researchers concluded that early bilinguals
could achieve VOT productions that were monolingual-like but not identical across
all phonemes. This conclusion must be interpreted cautiously because of the small
number of participants in the study (three per group).
Sundara et al. (2006) investigated early bilinguals' production of coronal stops
in CE and CF. The five bilingual participants were exposed to CE and CF simultaneously at home from their parents, and their schooling was completed in both

58

languages (at different school levels); they had a high self-rating of knowledge of
both languages, and did not have detectable accents. To compare productions of
bilingual and monolingual speakers, six monolingual CE and six monolingual CF
participants were included in the study. The bilingual participants were tested in
two separate sessions, one for each language, and by different experimenters in
each session. Participants were recorded producing bisyllabic words with coronal
stops in word initial position in a carrier phrase for each language. Differences in
VOT may have been affected by the different word-level stress patterns of CE and
CF: in CE, stress varies but tends to fall on the first syllable in bisyllabic words,
whereas CF stress falls on the final syllable (or penultimate in the case of words
ending in the vowel schwa). Thus, in Sundara et al., VOT may be underestimated
in CF because the word initial syllable was never the syllable that received word
level stress.
Findings from Sundara et al. (2006) yielded two major differences compared to
Caramazza's study. First, unlike the speakers in the Caramazza study, all speakers
(monolinguals and bilinguals) produced nonoverlapping distributions of VOT for
/t/ and /d/. Second, the bilingual speakers produced different VOT values for
voiced and voiceless stops when speaking CE than when speaking CF: when
speaking CE, the bilingual participants produced lead VOT for /d/ in 73.6% of
tokens; in CF, the bilingual participants produced lead VOT for /d/ in 100% of
tokens and short-lag VOT for /t/ in all tokens. Despite the somewhat bimodal
distribution of /d/ in CE, Sundara et al. (2006) conducted statistical analysis to
test for group differences in the production of coronal stops in CE and CF and
concluded that bilingual speakers can achieve nativelike production of VOT in
CF for /t/ and /d/, and in CE for /t/, but not /d/, when exposed to both languages
simultaneously.
In summary, Caramazza et al. (2006), Hazan and Boulakia (1993), MacLeod
and Stoel-Gammon (2005), and Sundara et al. (2006) investigated the production
of VOT by English-French bilinguals who acquired their two languages during
childhood. However, based on these studies, the question of phonological proficiency in childhood bilinguals is difficult to address because of two methodological
issues: (a) differences in the selection of target words, and (b) differences in the
ages of second language acquisition. With regard to target words, Caramazza
et al. (2006) analyzed production of stops in all three places of articulation, but
only 3 target words per place were used in the production task, and these words
were produced in isolation. Production of a very small set of target words makes it
difficult to generalize to a wider set of lexical targets, and the production of words
in isolation is a poor approximation of spontaneous speech. In contrast, Hazan
and Boulakia (1993) elicited 10 monosyllabic target words in carrier phrases, but
limited their investigation to labial stops. This focus on one place of articulation
makes it difficult to generalize the results to other stops. Sundara et al.'s (2006)
investigation was limited to coronal stops, which differ in CE and CF in VOT
and also in place of articulation: CE coronals are produced with lingual contact to
the alveolar ridge, whereas CF coronals are produced with lingual contact to the
back of the front teeth. Finally, Sundara et al. (2006) elicited a wider variety of
target words in carrier phrases but used bisyllabic words. Because English tends to
stress the first syllable of words and French the last syllable of words, the resulting

Applied Psycholinguistics 30:1

59

differences in VOT may be due to prosodic rather than phonological effects. The
current study differs from these studies by analyzing labial and coronal stops,
selecting monosyllabic real words with vowels that are similar across the two
languages, and eliciting the target word in a carrier phrase.
For studies designed to address the question of phonological proficiency in
childhood bilinguals, another important aspect of the methodology is the issue of
age of L2 acquisition. In the Caramazza et al. (2006) and Hazan and Boulakia
(1993) studies, late bilinguals' production (and perception) of VOT was influenced
by age of exposure to their L2, presumably leading to biases in both phonetic
production and perception toward speakers' L1. Moreover, in addition to age of
L2 acquisition, frequency of language use should be considered in the selection
of bilingual participants (Piske, MacKay, & Flege, 2001). For instance, despite
early ages of exposure to their L2, one-third of the "early" bilinguals in Hazan and
Boulakia's (1993) study were rated as having moderate accents, suggesting that
one language was used more frequently than the other. Thus, production of VOT
in their L2 may have been compromised. Contrasting monolingual speakers with
early bilinguals without accented speech, as was done in study by MacLeod and
Stoel-Gammon (2005) and Sundara et al. (2006), provides a better understanding
of the bilingual capacity for phonetic and phonological differentiation; in other
words, the extent to which a bilingual can be a native speaker of two languages.
Thus, the current study includes only early bilinguals who acquired their L2 by
age 4 and used both languages in daily living contexts after acquisition.
CURRENT STUDY

The goal of this study is to investigate the extent to which bilingual speakers can
produce nativelike speech in two languages. Three research questions were of
interest: What are the general patterns of VOT production in the bilingual and
monolingual participants? For each phoneme in each language, do the bilinguals
produce different mean VOT than monolinguals of the two languages? For each
phoneme in each language, do monolinguals and bilinguals produce different
degree of variability in VOT? Based on the research reviewed above and the two
applicable hypotheses presented by Flege's (1995) SLM, two possible outcomes
are expected. Either the bilinguals will treat similar sounds as allophones, resulting
in greater variability in VOT for particular CE-CF stop pairs (this outcome would
result in larger standard deviations for VOT and means with different VOT values
compared to monolingual speakers for that particular CE-CF stop pairs), or the
bilinguals will produce monolingual-like VOT in both languages because they
have been exposed to both languages since early childhood and continue to use
both languages daily (this would result in standard deviations and means for VOT
that are not significantly different from monolingual speakers).
Method
Participants. All participants resided between Ottawa and Montreal, Canada,

a region that provides an ideal situation for investigating bilingual acquisition
because of the similar contexts available for using both languages and the similar

Applied Psycholinguistics 30:1

60

social status of the two languages (Mougeon & Beniak, 1991). This region includes
both urban and rural areas between Ottawa, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec, where
approximately 70 to 90% of inhabitants speak CF as their L1 (Statistics Canada,
2001), and the remaining population speaks predominantly CE. For political,
social, and economic reasons, the region also provides numerous contexts for
using both CE and CF, thus strengthening the linguistic skills of bilingual residents.
An understanding of the nature of bilingualism in this region and related factors
guided the selection of participants for this study.
Twenty-three individuals (6 males, 17 females) participated in this investigation:
7 monolingual French speakers, 8 monolingual CE speakers, and 8 "early" CE-CF
bilingual speakers; for this study, early bilinguals are defined as bilinguals who
acquired their L2 before the age of 4 years either in the home or at daycare. All
participants were identified as "good examples" of each group by community contacts and met the following inclusionary criteria: (a) they were lifetime residents of
the region between Ottawa and Montreal; (b) they were between 18 and 62 years
of age; and (c) according to self-report, they had normal language development.
Table 1 summarizes participant demographic and language information including gender of participant, age in years, L1, age of L2 acquisition, and self-reported
use of each language at home, at work, and in leisure. The bilinguals are presented first, followed by the CF monolinguals, and the CE monolinguals. The
bilinguals met four additional inclusionary criteria: (a) they used both CE and
CF in two of the three contexts (i.e., home, work/school, or leisure), (b) they
used CE and CF approximately equal frequency in at least one context, (c) they
reported continuous use of both languages since acquisition, and (d) they were
observed to use both languages proficiently by the experimenter (the first author,
an early CF-CE bilingual) and by community contacts. It is important to note
that all bilinguals worked (or attended school) full-time and thus the context of
work/school represents a minimum of 40 hr/week. Thus, the context of home and
work/school likely represents the majority of waking hours in a typical week for
these participants.
Because the research was conducted in a bilingual area of Canada, the monolinguals in this study had exposure to either CE or CF in addition to their first
language. Despite this exposure, it was important to select monolingual speakers
from this region to eliminate the possibility of dialectal variation in use of VOT.
Thus, for the monolingual groups, exposure to CE or CF was limited to L2 classes
in school and very limited use of the L2 within the community (in either work
or leisure). All monolinguals reported limited proficiency in their L2, which was
corroborated by the experimenter and by the community contacts.
Stimuli. The present study investigates VOT in the production of labial and

coronal stops of CF and CE. In terms of articulation, the bilabial stops are produced
similarly in both languages, whereas coronal stops of CE are produced with an
alveolar place of articulation and those of CF with a dental place of articulation
(Sundara, 2005; Tranel, 1980; Walker, 1985).
VOT was examined in productions of stop-initial CE and CF words. Target words were selected so that they would be phonologically similar in both
languages, especially with regard to target consonant and the vowel context; the

CF-1 had not learned CE at the time of the experiment.

following criteria were used: (a) all words were common, real words in CE or
CF; (b) all words were monosyllabic (to reduce the effects of language-specific
stress patterns); (c) all words contained one of three vowels, in CE /ae, u, E/ and
in CF /a, u, E/ (those vowels that are produced similarly in CE and CF); and
(d) all words began with coronal or bilabial stops (velar stops were not included
because of the low frequency of real words that met the second and third criteria).
There were nine words for each of the four stop consonants for each language
(except /d/-words in CF, where there were only seven words), and each vowel was
equally represented. For example, there were three /bae/-words, three /bu/-words,
and three /bE/-words. In total, there were 36 different words in CE and 34 different
words in CF. Appendix A contains a list of target words used in the study.
Participants were tested individually in a quiet room either at their home or their
work. The monolingual participants were tested in a single session; the bilingual
participants were tested in two separate sessions separated by several days. The first

author conducted all the data collection using the target language of the session
throughout each session. Each session began with a brief interview regarding
language use and experience (two interviews for bilingual participants to establish
the language of testing and to maintain the same task order across sessions). The
interviews were followed by the carrier phrase task, in which the participants were
asked to read the target words, printed on index cards, in the carrier phrase "I
can say target word again target word." (in CF "Je peux dire target word encore
target word.") The target words were elicited within a carrier phrase to achieve
similar prosodic environments for the production of the target words: first in
utterance medial position, and second in utterance final position. Although within
a language VOT varies because of position within an utterance, the differences in
VOT between groups of monolingual and bilingual speakers have been found to
remain stable (Flege, 1991). In addition, the use of carrier phrases in this study
provides comparable data to previous studies using this elicitation method (Hazan
& Boulakia, 1993; MacLeod & Stoel-Gammon, 2005; Sundara et al., 2006).
Digital audio recordings of each session were recorded at a 16 bit rate and
44.1 kHz using either (a) audio recordings using a Casio DA-7 Digital Audio Tape
recorder or (b) an Apogee Mini-Me portable microphone converter and an Apple
PowerBook. All recordings were made using an AKG Condenser Microphone
(C420 MicroMic Series II).
Acoustic analysis. Both productions of the target word in the carrier phrase were
analyzed. Because of extraneous noise, mispronunciation, or signal that otherwise
did not meet the criteria for measurement, a small number of words were excluded
from the analysis of each group: for bilinguals, 36 of 576 possible words in
CE and 6 of 544 possible words in CF; for CE monolinguals 4 of 576 possible
words; and for CF monolinguals, all words were analyzed. Acoustic analysis of
the remaining tokens was completed using PRAAT (Boersma, 2001); each token
was viewed within a 200-ms window and measurements were taken within this
window size. The VOT values were obtained from the waveform and verified with
the corresponding wide-band spectrogram because the waveform is resistant to
temporal smearing, whereas the spectrogram is not (Davis, 1995; Johnson, 2003).
Positive VOT exhibited a sharp spike in the waveform denoting a release burst,
and the onset of voicing was identified as the last extreme negative deviation from
0 in the waveform that preceded the onset of regular voiced pulsation (i.e., jagged
and "saw-tooth" waveforms). Negative (or lead) VOT values exhibited regular
waves prior to the release burst associated with glottal pulsations; these waves
were regular and small in amplitude with a corresponding band of voicing in the
spectrogram.
In fewer than 10% of tokens with lead VOT, glottal pulsations were continuous
from the preceding consonant through to the release of the stop burst. Additional
criteria used to distinguish the lead VOT from preceding voiced sounds were as
follows: (a) when the stop followed the trill allophone, /r/, of the uvular fricative
(/A/), an allophone that is in free variation in CF of this region (Baligand, 1995),
lead VOT was identified by the end of vertical striations on the spectrogram (i.e.,
the frication noise), and a waveform that becomes smooth with regular pulsation;
(b) when the stop followed an alveolar nasal (CE /n/), lead VOT was identified by

RESULTS

Three research questions were addressed in this study. First, what are the general patterns of VOT production in bilingual and monolingual speakers? Second,
for each phoneme in each language, do early bilinguals produce different mean
VOT than monolinguals of the two languages? Third, for each phoneme in each
language, do monolingual and bilingual speakers produce different degree of
variability in VOT? Three independent variables were included in this study:
group, language, and phoneme. The groups were created based on their language
background: CF-CE bilinguals, CF monolingual, and CE monolingual. Group
membership was treated as the main independent variable. Two additional independent variables were language (CE or CF), and phoneme (/p/, /b/, /t/, or
/d/).
Group data for VOT are summarized in Table 2, which shows the grand mean
VOT (calculated for each group by adding the mean VOT for each participant
divided by the number of participants in the group) and the mean standard deviations (calculated for each group by adding the standard deviation for each
participant divided by the number of participants in that group) for the three
groups: monolingual CF, bilinguals in CF, monolingual CE, and bilinguals in CE.
In the statistical analyses, mean VOT and standard deviation (SD) of VOT were
calculated for each participant and then used to compare across groups. First, for
participant, a mean was calculated for each stop category in each language by
adding the VOT values for each stop and dividing by the number of repetitions
of that stop. Then, based on this mean the SD was also calculated for each stop
category in each language using the VOT values of each stop.

Group patterns and individual differences

This section briefly describes the group patterns and individual differences observed in the data. The VOT patterns for monolingual English (MON-CE),
bilingual English (BIL-CE), bilingual French (BIL-CF), and monolingual French
(MON-CF) are presented in Figure 1. The brackets contain 80% of the distribution. The center half of the distribution occurs within the boxes, and the line
within each box represents the median value of the distribution. Two main patterns
emerge from visual inspection of the box plots of Figure 1. First, the CE and CF
monolingual groups exhibit different ranges of VOT for different targets: the CE
monolinguals produce short-lag tokens for /b/ and /d/ and long-lag tokens for /p/
and /t/; by comparison, the CF monolinguals produce prevoiced tokens for /b/
and /d/ and short-lag tokens for /p/ and /t/, with few long-lag tokens. Statistical
analyses of these distributions are presented below.

65

The second pattern that can be seen in Figure 1 is that the voiced tokens,
/b/ and /d/, had a somewhat bimodal distribution, especially for the bilingual
speakers. This bimodal distribution is illustrated in Figure 2 for the monolingual
and bilingual groups production English, and in Figure 3 for the same groups
producing French. An examination of the percentage of negative VOT values
revealed the following patterns. All groups produced some tokens with VOT
ranges in either the short-lag or lead VOT regions. In CE, the bilinguals produced
lead voicing for /b/ in 48.6% of tokens (67 prevoiced out of 138 tokens), and
/d/ in 27.8% of tokens (38 of 135); the monolingual CE speakers produced lead
voicing for /b/ in 20.2% of tokens (26 of 125) and for /d/ in 10.1% of tokens (13
of 129); the remaining productions had positive VOT values. In CF, the bilinguals
produced lead voicing for /b/ in 81.3% of tokens (111 of 141) and for /d/ in
88.5% tokens (84 of 97); whereas the monolingual CF produced lead voicing for
/b/ in 98.4% of tokens (123 of 125) and for /d/ in 96.8% of tokens (90 of 93);
the remaining productions had positive VOT values. For the bilingual speakers'
productions of English stops, Figure 1 shows greater variability for voiced stops as
well as the bimodal distribution described above. This pattern is discussed further
in the section on variability below. Despite the somewhat bimodal distributions
for voiced stops produced by the bilinguals in CE, a repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was conducted to investigate the original research questions.
VOT: Central tendencies

The statistical analysis compared the groups in each language separately because
the bilingual participants took part in two testing sessions, whereas the monolingual participants took part in only one. Within each language, a repeated-measures
ANOVA was conducted: the repeated measure was mean VOT in milliseconds of
/b/, /d/, /p/, and /t/ for each participant. In cases of significant main effects, the
repeated-measures ANOVA was followed by either ANOVA or t tests to investigate
the relationship between the variables. In cases where the sphericity assumption
was violated (i.e., standard deviations that are too different from one measure to
the next), the repeated-measures ANOVA was corrected by reducing the degrees of
freedom using the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon (McCall & Aplebaum, 1973). The
analysis was conducted using SAS-JMP version 7, with a significance level of .05.
Mean VOT for each stop category was calculated for each participant and used
to compare the production of the CF monolingual, CE monolingual, and bilingual
groups. For the analysis in CF and CE, the test for sphericity using Mauchly's
criterion revealed a violation of the sphericity assumption (in CF, p = .0001,
and in CE, p = .001). Consequently, the repeated-measures ANOVA corrected
by Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon is reported. In CF, a repeated-measures ANOVA
(corrected Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon) resulted in a main effect for consonant,
F (3, 26.52) = 266.21, p < .0001, but not for group, F (1, 13) = 2.17, p <
.1642, and there was no interaction, F (3, 26.52) = 0.59, p < .5641. This finding
indicates that both the bilinguals and the CF monolinguals produced significantly
different VOTs for the four stops, but that VOT did not differ across groups.
In CE, a repeated-measures ANOVA resulted in a significant main effect for
consonant, F (3, 25.30) = 228.49, p < .0001, a significant main effect for group,

F (1, 14) = 4.49, p < .044, and an interaction between consonants and group, F (3,
25.30) = 9.52, p < .0011, indicating that the bilinguals were producing VOTs that
were significantly different from the CE monolingual speakers. To investigate this
interaction further, a one-way ANOVA was conducted testing group differences
for the production of stops in CE. When speaking CE, the monolingual and the
bilingual groups exhibited significantly different mean VOT for words beginning
with voiced stops: /b/, F (1, 14) = 11.59, p < .004, and /d/, F (1, 14) = 23.84,
p < .001, but not for voiceless stops: /p/, F (1, 14) = .26, p < .618, and /t/,
F (1, 14) = .24, p < .632. In summary, in CF the monolingual CF group and the
bilinguals did not produce different mean VOT, but in CE the bilinguals produced
significantly different VOT for the voiced stops /b/ and /d/ as a result of more
frequent prevoicing of these stops than the monolingual CE group.

Variability of VOT

In addition to comparing the mean VOT values, variability across the groups was
investigated by testing for equality of variance across groups and phonemes using
Brown Forsythe's test for equality of variances (a robust test with regards to Type 1
error; Brown & Forsythe, 1974; Hayes, 2005). For each language, the VOT values
for each phoneme produced by each participant were compared across groups. In
CF, the results from Brown Forsythe's test indicated no significant differences in
the equality of the variances across the monolingual and bilingual groups, F (1,
1016) = 2.08, p < .1490, but did show significant differences in the equality of
variance across the phonemes, F (3, 1014) = 65.72, p < .0001. When the CF stops
were grouped by voicing, the Brown Forsythe test revealed significant differences
the equality of the variances across voicing categories, F (1, 1016) = 189.62,
p < .0001. In CE, the results from Brown Forsythe's test indicated significant
differences in the equality of the variances across the monolingual and bilingual
groups, F (1, 1120) = 47.96, p < .0001, and across the phonemes, F (3, 1118) =
18.15, p < .0001. To investigate these results in CE, the variance between the
monolinguals and the bilinguals was compared for voiced and voiceless stops. The
results from the Brown Forsythe's test indicate that the groups have significant
differences in the equality of variances for voiced stops, F (1, 561) = 63.4089,
p < .0001, but not voiceless stops, F (1, 557) = 0.24, p < .6224.
An examination of the individual productions of lead voicing (i.e., negative
VOT) tokens by bilinguals in English revealed no patterns associated with L1 or
age of L2 acquisition. Table 3 presents individual data for the bilingual group
including L1, age of L2 acquisition, mean VOT for /b/ and /d/, and the percentage
of tokens with lead voicing for these stops. As shown in Figure 2, these bimodal
distributions are larger for the bilingual speakers than for the monolingual speakers,
although all groups produce some /b/ and /d/ tokens that were outside the expected
range. In addition, in productions of CE, both bilingual and monolingual speakers
tended to exhibit more frequent prevoicing for /b/ than /d/.
To summarize, this question targeted the variance across groups for each stop in
each language by asking: was a difference observed in the variance in VOT values

The results indicated that in CF both the monolinguals and bilinguals produced
significantly more variability in VOT for /b/ and /d/ than for /p/ and /t/, but
there were no group differences. In contrast, in CE the bilinguals speakers were
significantly more variable than monolingual speakers for /b/ and /d/, but there
were no significant differences in variability for /p/ and /t/.
GENERAL DISCUSSION

Three research questions were targeted in this study. The first question was,
what are the general patterns of VOT production in bilingual and monolingual
speakers? This descriptive analysis revealed that monolingual productions are
similar to those reported for English and French by both Caramazza et al. (1973)
and Sundara (2005). However, in contrast with Caramazza et al. (1973) findings,
it is the English monolinguals in the present study who have overlap in VOT
distributions, whereas the French do not. The descriptive analysis also showed
that distribution of voiced tokens for bilingual speakers was more bimodal than
for monolingual speakers.
The second question examined the existence of distinct phonological categories: for each phoneme in each language, do bilinguals produce different mean
VOT than monolinguals of both their languages? The results demonstrated that
when speaking French, the bilinguals did not produce significantly different mean
VOT than the French monolinguals; however, when speaking English, bilingual speakers produced significantly more prevoicing of VOT for the voiced
stops.
The third question targeted phonetic variation: for each phoneme in each language, do monolinguals and early bilinguals produce different variability in VOT?

The findings revealed a similar pattern: when speaking French, the bilinguals
were not statistically different from the French monolinguals, but when speaking
English, the bilinguals produced significantly more variation in voiced stops than
the English monolinguals.
The occurrence of bimodal distributions in the production of voiced stops in CE
was expected based on the results reported by Caramazza et al. (1973), Hazan and
Boulakia (1993), MacLeod and Stoel-Gammon (2005), and Sundara et al. (2006).
In contrast to previous studies, it was possible to address individual variability in
lead voicing in CE across both voiced stops in the present study. It appears that
individual variability was not related to L1 or age of exposure to L2, nor was
it related to frequency of language use (because all participants shared similar
frequency of use across contexts). Table 4 summarizes findings from the three
studies reviewed and the present study regarding types of bilinguals included,
the stops targeted, and the frequency of lead voicing for CE stops, as reported
in the four studies reviewed and the present study. Based on this summary, the
bilinguals across the four studies produce English stops with both lead voicing and
short-lag voicing. Compared to Hazan and Boulakia (1993), who examined British
English and continental French, the bilinguals in the present study produced more
frequent prevoicing for /b/ (48.6%) than the English-dominant bilinguals (23.9%),
but less frequent lead voicing than the French-dominant bilinguals (69-75%).
Compared to Sundara et al. (2006), the bilinguals in the present study produced
less frequent prevoicing of /d/ (27.8%) in monosyllables than the simultaneous
bilinguals (73.6%) in disyllables.
The SLM model for bilingual speech learning provides a set of predictions
(Flege, 1995), two of which can be applied here. The first hypothesis proposes that
sounds in a speaker's L1 and L2 are related to one another at an allophonic level,
rather than at a more abstract phonemic level. This hypothesis is only partially
supported in this study: although, the bilinguals maintained monolingual-like
phonemic contrasts in both languages, and for six of the eight phonemes studied
they produced mean VOT within the monolingual range (i.e., for all but /b/ and /d/
in English). The bilinguals had monolingual-like variation in all stops but English
/b/ and /d/. Thus, it is possible that the bilinguals voiced stops (/b/ and /d/ in
CE and CF) in the bilingual's system are related at an allophonic level. SLM's
second hypothesis proposes that bilinguals who acquired two languages during
early childhood will produce monolingual-like phonetic values in both languages.
However, like the bilinguals in Caramazza et al.'s (1973) study who learned their
L2 by the age of 7 years, the bilinguals in this study (who acquired both languages
before the age of 4 years) exhibited phonetic variation for VOT that was more
similar to the French monolinguals across all tokens, than to the English-speaking
monolinguals for voiced tokens.
The finding that bilinguals produced phonetic variation for VOT that was more
similar to French than English monolinguals cannot be because of language dominance (as was the case in the Caramazza study): four of the participants in the
present study are "simultaneous bilinguals (i.e., exposed to both languages from
birth; of the remaining four bilinguals, two were exposed to English first and two
French first). If there were a definitive difference associated with simultaneous

MacLeod & Stoel-Gammon: VOT production by early bilinguals in two languages

versus early L2 acquisition in VOT production, the participants who were exposed
to English later (i.e., Bilingual-4 and Bilingual-5, see Table 1) would be expected
to have the most French-like VOT distributions; that is, these speakers would be
expected to have the longest lead VOT and highest percentage of lead VOT. As
shown in Table 3, this was not the case, as there is no clear pattern of lead VOT
use within this early period of exposure to two languages between simultaneous
and early bilinguals.
One possible explanation for the finding is a phonetic one: VOT control may
only be important at phonemic boundary regions, as suggested by Caramazza
and colleagues (1973). Previous research has demonstrated that monolingual English speakers categorize short-lag VOT and lead VOT as "voiced" (Caramazza
et al., 1973; Hazan & Boulakia, 1993). Thus, the early bilingual speakers in the
present study may be taking advantage of this large "voiced" category for English
listeners, and thus producing VOT values ranging from prevoiced to short lag.
This explanation is supported by the bilingual speakers' maintenance of the other
stop categories more likely to interfere with accurate perception by monolingual
listeners. For instance, the voicing contrast between short- and long-lag VOT in
English is maintained by the bilingual speakers in this study, and likewise for
the lead VOT and short-lag VOT important for French. Watson (1990) observed
a similar pattern in the development of VOT in bilingual children. He proposed
that bilinguals tend to maintain acceptable language-specific distinctions while
reducing the processing load by allowing for overlap in specific contrasts. In line
with this suggestion, bilinguals in this study are maintaining VOT precision at the
phonemic boundary regions, thus producing acceptable VOT distinctions; at the
same time, they appear to be reducing the processing load by allowing overlap in
the voicing contrast of CE.
A second possible explanation is that the bilingual speakers associate the English
voiced category with two subcategories: a prevoiced stop and a short-lag stop that
leads to the presence of a somewhat bimodal distribution. If the English voiced
category is analyzed as a single category, the bilinguals appear to produce more
variability around a single mean for voiced stops; if, in contrast, the English
voiced category is analyzed as two subcategories, the bilinguals would not have
more variability around the two means for voiced stops. This "two category"
explanation applies only to English voiced stops; it does not hold for voiced stops
in French or voiceless stops in either language, and does not explain why the
distribution is more bimodal for English voiced labials than voiced coronals for
this group of bilinguals.
A third explanation is that the contrast between prevoiced and short lag stops,
as in CF, is more "natural" (or less marked) than the contrast between short-lag
and long-lag stops, as in CE. In the survey published by Madiesson (1984), 72%
of languages with a two-way distinction in voicing of stops had a contrast between
"plain voiceless" and "voiced" stops (as in CF); in contrast, 17% of the languages
had a contrast between plain voiceless and aspirated voiceless (as in CE). The
finding that, regardless of language dominance, VOT patterns of the bilingual
speakers in the present study were more similar to CF than CE may reflect the
distribution of voicing contrasts across languages of the world.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this study provides important data regarding early bilingual speakers' ability to maintain phonemic contrasts and phonetic variation associated with
these contrasts in CE and CF. The early bilingual participants were produced
monolingual-like VOT with regard to mean and standard deviation for six of
the eight stops studied: they produced monolingual-like VOT for /p, b, t, d/
of CF, and monolingual-like VOT for voiceless stops /p, t/ of CF. Despite the
bilingual participants' history of the balanced use of both languages across contexts and similar ages of language acquisition, unexpectedly, they did not exhibit
a monolingual-like VOT production pattern for voiced stops in English. These
findings speak directly to the nature of two phonetic systems within one speaker
and to individual variation in production of these phonemic categories, suggesting that even early, balanced bilinguals will have phonological systems that are
not identical to monolingual speakers of both their languages. It is interesting
to note that for these bilinguals, the only contrasts that is not monolingual-like
(CE /b, d/) is a distinction in voicing that does not cross a category boundary in CE,
and thus would not impair perception of those stops as voiced by a monolingual
English listener. Future research with this population would benefit from studies
of perception of VOT to determine similarities and differences between bilingual
and monolingual speakers in this domain.
