Abstract
This longitudinal study examined the influence of child-specific and environmental factors
on the development of English receptive vocabulary and grammar by two groups of Danish
children: Early Starters (ES) and Late Starters (LS). Age of onset, gender, language aptitude
and SES significantly predicted both outcome measures. English competence beliefs (ECB)
were positively related to L2 proficiency but only for children with low foreign language
classroom anxiety (FLCA), suggesting a dynamic relationship between ECB and FLCA.
Extramural audiovisual viewing and reading played a differential role for ES vs. LS whereas
extramural English speaking significantly interacted with gender. Finally, child-specific
factors explained more of the variance in English proficiency than environmental factors.
This finding, which contradicts results obtained in instructed settings (e.g., Sun,
Steinkrauss, Tendeiro & de Bot, 2016) but parallels those in naturalistic settings (e.g.,
Paradis, 2011), supports the special status of English in countries with a high degree of
informal contact with English.

Introduction
Research on young language learners (YLLs) has shown a great deal of variability in their
development of second language (L2) skills. Various factors have been suggested to account
for such variability: child-specific factors (often characterized as child-internal factors),
which comprise properties inherent to the learner such as age of onset (i.e., the age at
which L2 learning begins), and environmental factors (often characterized as child-external
factors), which comprise aspects of the learner's learning context such as input quantity
and quality. Research conducted in L2 naturalistic contexts has shown a greater role for childspecific factors (e.g., Paradis, 2011) while research conducted in foreign language (FL)
instructed contexts has shown a greater role for environmental factors (Sun et al., 2016).
This discrepancy has been attributed to different input conditions in the two contexts, with
children in naturalistic settings being exposed to a higher amount of L2 English input than
children in instructed settings.
The present study contributes to existing research by exploring the role of childspecific vs. environmental factors in a context, i.e., Denmark, where the distinction
between a second and FL context is somewhat blurred due to the easy access to
English in everyday life (Hannibal Jensen, 2017; Munoz, Cadierno & Casas, 2018).
Thus, children learning English in Denmark do not encounter the typical FL teaching
situation - namely, a situation where the exposure to the L2 is restricted to the classroom
context, and thus is limited in terms of its source (mainly the teacher), quantity, and
quality (Munoz, 2008).
The study includes factors that have previously been identified as having an impact on children's acquisition of L2 English skills. The child-specific factors comprised age of onset (e.g.,
Jaekel, Schurig, Florian & Ritter, 2017; Unsworth, Persson, Prins & de Bot, 2015), language
aptitude (e.g., Tellier & Roehr-Brackin, 2013; Unsworth et al., 2015), gender (e.g., Jaekel
et al., 2017; Sylven & Sundqvist, 2012) and psychological factors such as learners' foreign language competence beliefs (e.g., Courtney, Graham, Tonkyn & Marinis, 2017; Mihaljevi
Djigunovi & Lopriore, 2011), foreign language classroom anxiety (e.g., Fenyvesi, Hansen &
Cadierno, 2020; Gursoy & Akin, 2013), learners' motivation and attitudes (e.g., Enever,
2011; Mihaljevi Djigunovi & Nikolov, 2019), and learners' mindset (e.g., Fenyvesi et al.,
2020; Mercer & Ryan, 2010). The environmental factors comprised children's contact with
English outside the classroom (e.g., Lindgren & Munoz, 2013; Sylven & Sundqvist, 2012)
and socio-economic status (e.g., Goldberg, Paradis & Crago, 2008; Hoff, 2013), parents' knowledge of English, and their use of English in their daily lives (e.g., Hewitt, 2009; Munoz &
Lindgren, 2011).

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

Furthermore, while previous research has mostly been crosssectional, the present study examined the influence of the different factors on English L2 learning with proficiency data collected
longitudinally (see also Unsworth et al., 2015).
The present study is part of a larger project that followed two
groups of children who started learning English in school in the
same year (2014): an early starter group (ES) who began in the
first grade (7-8 years old) and a late starter group (LS) who
began in the third grade (9-10 years old). An earlier study
(Cadierno, Hansen, Lauridsen, Eskildsen, Fenyvesi, Hannibal
Jensen & aus der Wieschen, 2020) compared the learning rate
and short-term proficiency of the ES vs. LS across three years.
The results showed a rate advantage of the LS over the ES for
receptive vocabulary and grammar and a gender difference:
boys achieved higher levels of L2 proficiency and showed faster
learning rates than girls. The present study adds to our earlier
work by examining not only the role of age of onset and gender
in children's English proficiency but, as described above,
exploring the combined influence of a range of other childspecific factors as well as environmental factors on children's
L2 skills.
Furthermore, for the present study, only proficiency data
from the last two waves were included as the instruments measuring the other factors mentioned above were administered
between these two rounds of proficiency data collection (see
below). This ensured a close link between the data collection
points for proficiency data and the predictors motivated by
claims about long-term instability of individual factors in second
language acquisition (SLA; e.g., Kormos, 2013). For the sake of
exposition, we will refer to the last two waves as waves 1 and 2
from hereon.

Background
Child-specific factors
Age of onset of formal instruction is controversial in the field of
(child) L2 acquisition. Research conducted in naturalistic contexts
has shown a rate advantage for older learners but an ultimate
attainment advantage for younger learners (e.g., Blom & Bosma,
2016; Goldberg et al., 2008; Unsworth, Argyri, Cornips, Hulk,
Sorace, and Tsimpli, 2014), thus supporting "the younger, the better" view. Research conducted in instructional contexts has also
shown a rate advantage for older learners (e.g., Cadierno et al.,
2020; Garcia Mayo & Garcia Lecumberri, 2003; Munoz, 2006;
Pfenninger & Singleton, 2017) but has failed to provide support
for the ultimate attainment advantage of younger learners (e.g.,
Munoz, 2011). The different results obtained in naturalistic vs.
instructional settings may be due to the asymmetries found in
the two contexts, mainly concerning the amount of exposure to
the target language, which is more restricted in instructional
settings, and the different status of ultimate attainment in the
two learning contexts. Whereas research in naturalistic contexts
compares younger and older starters in terms of the final product
of the L2 learning process bounded by a minimum length of time
(i.e., at least 10 years of residence), studies in instructional settings
compare the gains of younger and older learners after a given
number of instructional hours as specified in their educational
system (Munoz, 2008).
Language aptitude, defined as "the individual's initial state of
readiness and capacity for learning a foreign language" (Carroll,
1981, p. 86), is another child-specific factor thought to predict

567

success in young learners (e.g., Kiss & Nikolov, 2005; Tellier &
Roehr-Brackin, 2013). Even though language aptitude has predominantly been conceptualized as consisting of components
such as phonetic coding ability (e.g., Carroll, 1981), several
researchers have advocated including general working memory
and phonological short-term memory capacity as central components of language aptitude (e.g., Alexiou, 2009; Robinson, 2005),
with some studies showing correlations between working memory
tests (e.g., the backward digit span test) and traditional aptitude
scores (e.g., Safar & Kormos, 2008).
In relation to gender, there is a widespread belief that females
tend to be better L2 learners than males (Saville-Troike, 2006),
and, in fact, studies conducted in L2 and FL contexts have confirmed this belief (e.g., Courtney et al., 2017; Jaekel et al., 2017).
However, recent research conducted in the Nordic countries
with YLLs has shown an advantage of boys over girls (e.g.,
Cadierno et al., 2020; Sylven & Sundqvist, 2012). Boys' superior
L2 skills have been explained in terms of their higher amount
of time spent on gaming outside the classroom (e.g., Hannibal
Jensen, 2017; Sylven & Sundqvist, 2012; but see De Wilde &
Eyckmans, 2017).
The role of foreign language competence beliefs, understood as
learners' evaluations of their own FL-competence, is an individual
factor that has recently attracted attention in SLA research
(Mihaljevi Djigunovi, 2015). YLLs often perceive themselves
as being good at languages but, as they grow older, they make
more realistic judgements of their own abilities as a function of
their increased language learning experience (e.g., Mihaljevi
Djigunovi & Lopriore, 2011). Additionally, several studies have
found a positive impact of positive language competence beliefs
on L2 proficiency, both for younger and older learners (e.g.,
Courtney et al., 2017; Fenyvesi et al., 2020; Mihaljevi
Djigunovi & Lopriore, 2011).
Foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA) is seen as a unique
form of anxiety that learners experience when learning and/or
using a foreign language (Horwitz, Horwitz & Cope, 1986).
Research on YLLs has shown a negative impact of FLCA on L2
achievement on various language measures (e.g., Abu-Rabia,
2004; Lu & Liu, 2011) and a tendency for YLLs to experience
negative emotions like anxiety when speaking, especially in
front of their peers (e.g., Kang, 2005; Lyons, 2014).
Additionally, studies have found that younger students are less
anxious about FL learning than older students (e.g., Fenyvesi
et al., 2020; Gursoy & Akin, 2013). Interestingly, FLCA has also
been found to be related to children's achievement-related selfconcepts, i.e., their foreign language competence beliefs.
Fenyvesi et al. (2020) found that in relation to the proficiency
gains in receptive vocabulary by LS children (9-10 years-old),
FLCA only impacted proficiency gains if the students had low
ECB. If the students had high ECB, their level of FLCA did not
impact their proficiency gains.
Motivation and attitudes are among the individual factors that
have attracted most attention in SLA. We target two motivational
constructs. (1) The difference between intrinsic (driven by an
enjoyment or interest in an activity) and extrinsic motivation (driven by external forces such as parents' opinions; Noels, Pelletier,
Clement & Vallerand, 2000). Previous research has shown that the
nature of motivation tends to change with age. For example,
Fenyvesi et al. (2020) found that 10-year-old Danish children's
motivation towards EFL was less extrinsic-oriented (i.e., dependent on external authorities such as parents and teachers) than that
of 8-year-olds.

(2) The ideal L2 self, which refers to the learners' imagined ideal
future self as an L2 speaker and is part of Dornyei's (2009) "L2
Motivational Self System." Studies with adolescents have confirmed the important role of learners' ideal L2 self on their
intended learning efforts (e.g., Csizer & Kormos, 2009), although
studies of the relationship between the ideal L2 self and learners'
actual L2 achievement have produced mixed results (e.g., Dornyei
& Chan, 2013; Kim & Kim, 2011). In relation to younger children,
it has been suggested that children who have not yet reached adolescence are unlikely to have possible selves that would influence
their L2 performance (Zentner & Renaud, 2007). However,
Munoz and Tragant (2015) identified certain precursors to ideal
L2 self in a 7-year longitudinal study with two children (aged
6/7-12/13) in which the parents were shown to be facilitators of
their children's ideal L2 selves.
Previous studies have generally found a positive relationship
between young learners' motivation and attitudes and different
measures of L2 proficiency (e.g., Mihaljevi Djigunovi &
Lopriore, 2011; Munoz & Tragant, 2001). However, Fenyvesi
et al. (2020) found that L2 proficiency was not predicted by
young Danish learners' attitudes towards English lessons, towards
different activities in the classroom, and towards the English language; nor precursors to their ideal L2 selves. Finally, previous
research has emphasized the role of English as a lingua franca
(e.g., Enever, 2011), of significant others such as parents and
teachers (e.g., Lindgren & Munoz, 2013) and of learners' attitudes
towards FL lessons (e.g., Enever, 2011) in children's L2
acquisition.
Learners' mindset is a factor that has only recently been studied in relation to L2 acquisition. This line of research, based on
Dweck (2000), distinguishes a fixed mindset (the belief that intelligence or ability is a fixed entity that people are born with and
cannot change much) from an incremental mindset (the belief
that intelligence or ability is malleable and can be developed
through effort). Following Mercer and Ryan's (2010) argument
that the same distinction applies within the domain of language
learning, research on L2 learning by young children has shown
that older children (aged 9 to 10 years) tend to have a more incremental mindset (aged 7 to 8 years), and that children with a more
incremental mindset achieve higher levels of receptive vocabulary
and grammar skills (Fenyvesi et al., 2020).
Environmental factors
Young learners' out-of-classroom contact with the FL and its
influence on L2 learning has attracted a great deal of research
attention in the last decades (see Sundqvist & Sylven, 2016).
Research has shown that engagement with extramural English
activities increases with age (e.g., Munoz, 2020a) and that boys
and girls prefer different types of out-of-classroom activities,
with boys spending more time on gaming and girls spending
more time on watching films or on online communities such as
Facebook (Hannibal Jensen, 2017; Munoz, 2020a; Sundqvist &
Sylven, 2016). Additionally, research conducted with YLLs
has shown a positive effect of out-of-classroom contact on different measures of children's L2 proficiency (e.g., Azzolini,
Campregher & Madia, 2020; Hannibal Jensen, 2017; Lindgren &
Munoz, 2013; Munoz et al., 2018; Sylven & Sundqvist, 2012)
even before they start formal instruction (e.g., De Wilde,
Brysbaert & Eyckmans, 2020; Puimege & Peters, 2019).
The role of out-of-classroom contact in L2 learning can be
explained by usage-based approaches which view language

Teresa Cadierno et al.

development as rooted in repeated language use and shaped by
the particular language patterns that learners are exposed to
(for an overview, see Cadierno & Eskildsen, 2015). Accordingly,
classroom learners who are in contact with the target language
beyond the classroom context can potentially benefit from the
implicit learning mechanisms that are characteristic of L1 and
naturalistic L2 acquisition (Munoz et al., 2018).
Family socio-economic status (SES) has been found to impact
both L1 and L2 child language acquisition (e.g., Butler & Le, 2018;
Goldberg et al., 2008; Hoff, 2013). Even though there is disagreement about what SES represents, "there is near a universal agreement that higher SES children have access to more of the
resources needed to support their positive development than do
lower SES children" (Bornstein & Bradley, 2003, p. 1). SES may
impact children's L2 (lexical) development because higher order
verbal interaction associated with high SES is crucial and may
be quantitatively and qualitatively reduced in a low SES environment (Goldberg et al., 2008).
Finally, parents' knowledge of English and their use of English
at work predicts children's L2 achievement (e.g., Hewitt, 2009;
Munoz & Lindgren, 2011). Highly knowledgeable parents who
are used to employing English in their daily lives may be able
to help the child with English homework or they may make the
TL country the destination for family holidays, thus creating
opportunities for exposure to the L2.
Research on young learners from a multi-factor perspective
In addition to the above review, a few studies have adopted a more
comprehensive multi-factor perspective by including several
internal and external factors in their design and examining
their relative impact on different language domains. In a study
of direct relevance to the present investigation, Sun et al. (2016)
examined the acquisition of English (receptive and productive
vocabulary and grammar) by a group of pre-school Chinese
learners. The results of the study showed that both internal and
external factors played an important role in children's L2 acquisition, but external factors explained more of the variance than
internal factors. This finding, which contradicted results from
previous studies conducted in naturalistic settings (e.g., Paradis,
2011), is probably due to the different input environments, with
children in FL settings having less English exposure than those
in naturalistic settings. In other words, the relative role of internal
vs. external factors in child second language acquisition seems to
be dependent on children's learning context, and more specifically, on their degree of exposure to the L2 input. On the basis
of the relative weight hypothesis, Sun, Yin, Amsah, and O'Brien
(2018) have likewise argued that input-rich contexts allow
child-specific resources to manifest themselves whereas inputpoor contexts suppress them.
Aim and research questions
While previous studies have investigated the role of child-specific
vs. environmental factors in more clear-cut naturalistic vs.
instructed settings, the present study examined the impact of
the two types of factors on the acquisition of English in a context
where the dichotomy between the naturalistic vs. instructed setting is blurred due to the pervasive access to English in everyday
life (see also Unsworth et al., 2014; Kuppens, 2010, for studies
conducted in similar contexts, i.e., the Netherlands and
Flanders). Specifically, the study, which was exploratory in nature,

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

investigated the impact of child-specific and environmental factors on the development of receptive vocabulary and grammar
by two groups of Danish primary school children who started
learning English in Grade 1 (7-years-old) or in Grade 3
(9-years-old). The following research questions were asked:
(1) What is the role of the following set of factors in children's
development of receptive vocabulary and grammar: (a) childspecific factors: age of onset, gender, language aptitude, learners' motivation, ECB, FLCA and learners' mindset; and (b)
environmental factors, including children's contact with
English outside the classroom, parental SES, parents' knowledge of English and their use of English in their daily lives?
(2) Is the role of the different factors the same for receptive
vocabulary and receptive grammar?
Method
Participants
A total of 276 children (139 boys, 137 girls; 111 ES, 165 LS) participated in the study. However, due to different response rates
for the various instruments, especially regarding the environmental factors, the number of participants varied between analyses.
Each table below specifies the number of participants in the
particular analysis. An overview of all the variables and response
rates (including descriptive statistics) can be found in Table S1.
All children began formal English instruction in 2014 but
differed as to whether they started learning English in the first
grade (ES; aged 7-8 years) or in the third grade (LS; aged 9 to
10 years). The children came from 6 elementary schools in the
Southern region of Denmark (see Cadierno et al., 2020, for
details).
All schools followed the same curriculum guidelines set forth
by the Ministry of Education, i.e., all children have to reach the
same objectives by the end of the 4th, 7th and 9th grade. For
example, by 4th grade, children should be able to participate in
short and simple conversations, understand and write frequent
words, expressions, and short texts in English on everyday topics.
The quite broad learning objectives for the 4th grade apply
nation-wide and teachers in Denmark are free to choose how to
fulfill them. With YLLs, the Ministry's pedagogical recommendations include oral and playful activities, English as the medium of
instruction, and teachers' use of gestures and body language to
facilitate understanding (see aus der Wieschen, 2017).
From qualitative classroom observations, we know that teachers often sang and played with the children and used picturebooks and age-appropriate textbooks, the latter mostly with the
LS. Regarding the language(s) of instruction, most teachers used
both English and Danish to varying degrees.
Schools varied with respect to the amount of English instruction hours they offered per week (1 or 2 weekly lessons) - therefore, the number of instruction hours was entered as a factor in
the statistical analyses. School principals agreed to participate
in the project and parents' passive consent was obtained through
the schools' intranet.
Instruments and procedure
English tests
Two standardized tests were used to measure children's English
receptive skills resulting from both formal and informal exposure

569

to English: The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition
(PPVT-4; Dunn & Dunn, 2007) and the Test for Reception of
Grammar, TROG-2 (Bishop, 2003). Although not developed for
testing EFL, the two tests have been used for that purpose and
are useful with children for whom L2 productive abilities are
expected to be limited (e.g., Sun et al., 2016; Unsworth et al.,
2015). Both tests consist of a picture-selection task where children
were asked to select one picture out of four which best corresponded to the stimulus word (PPVT) or sentence (TROG).
The PPVT-4 has 228 items and exists in two forms, A and B,
that were used in alternating years. To allow comparison of scores
achieved on PPVT forms A and B, respectively, raw scores were
converted to Growth Score Values (GSV), a non-normative system for measuring vocabulary development (Dunn & Dunn,
2007). The maximum GSV score for form A is 270 and for
form B 271, both corresponding to a raw score of 228. For the
TROG, the same form with 80 items was used each year. We present the results in terms of total single items correct (e.g.,
Unsworth et al., 2015).
Children were tested individually at their school as part of a
multi-day test program (see Cadierno & Eskildsen, 2018). For
both tests, instructions following the respective test manuals
were given in Danish. The only modification was that the
PPVT was always given starting from the first item, independently
of age (as in Cadierno et al., 2020; Unsworth et al., 2015). Test
items were presented via tape recordings by an expert English
speaker. The PPVT was always administered before the TROG
within the same collection session. Both tests were administered
in the two data collection waves. Wave 1 took place when the
ES and LS, respectively, had started their second and fourth
years of English classes in 2015 and wave 2 took place 1 year later.
Instruments eliciting information about child and environmental
factors
With respect to child-specific factors, data on the memory component of language aptitude were elicited by means of two tests
that were individually administered to the children in their L1
Danish: (1) The digit forward and backward repetition test
(sub-tests of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals
(CELF-4); Semel, Wiig & Secord, 2013) were given as measures
of phonological short-term memory and working-memory,
respectively. Children heard a sequence of numerical digits and
were asked to recall the sequence correctly, with increasingly
longer sequences being tested in each trial - both forward
(16 items) and backward (14 items). Children received 1 point
for correct answers and 0 for incorrect or no answers. (2) A
Danish adaptation of the Modern Language Aptitude Test,
Elementary Part 4 - Number learning (MLAT-E; Carroll &
Sapon, 1967). The test, which was adapted to Danish in terms
of phonological and phonetic structure, measures auditory and
rote memory abilities associated with sound-meaning relationships. Children learned the names of numbers in a new language,
and they were then asked to write these numbers in numerals
after hearing them spoken aloud. Children received 1 point for
correct answers and 0 points for incorrect or no answers. The
range of potential scores was from 0 to 25. The instructions
and the oral stimuli used in both tests had been recorded by a
Danish native speaker. The two language aptitude tests were
administered at wave 2.
Data on psychological factors (i.e., learners' motivation and
attitudes, ECB, FLCA and learners' mindset) were collected by
means of an oral questionnaire administered to the children

570

during their regular English classes (see Table S2). The questionnaire was completed by the children in Danish, their L1. The
questions were read aloud by one of the researchers, and the children responded by marking the smiley or dot/rectangle of their
choice on a 5-point Likert scale (see Fenyvesi et al., 2020, for
details). After filling in the first half of the questionnaire, the
classes were given a short break where they sang an English
song with the researcher and did some physical exercise. In half
of the classes, the first and the second halves of the questionnaire
were administered in reverse order to avoid order effects.
The reliability of the questionnaire was calculated using
Cronbach's alpha. The average coefficient across all the scales
was .69 (FLCA: .77; ECB: .83; reliance on external authorities: .63;
precursors to ideal L2 self: .64; English as a lingua franca: .67; attitudes towards English lessons: .79; attitudes towards different activities in English lessons: .66; attitudes towards English language: .67;
mindset: .55). These values are considered acceptable as young children tend to produce less internal consistent responses on scales,
with an average coefficient alpha of .65 (Borgers, de Leeuw &
Hox, 2000).
Data on environmental factors were collected by means of a
take-home questionnaire which the parents completed together
with their child in children's L1, Danish. The questionnaire was
adapted from one used in previous research (e.g., Munoz,
2020a; Munoz et al., 2018) and had undergone a two-part validation process consisting of colleagues' suggestions and pilottesting with learners in the same age range as the one included
in the present study.
Regarding extramural English, the questionnaire included
questions about the frequency of out-of-school contact and language use at home. The various types of activities were grouped
into the following factors: (a) Films: watching audiovisual material
(films, video clips) in English with, respectively, L1 subtitles, L2
subtitles, and no subtitles on, e.g., TV, YouTube, Netflix and cinema; (b) Games: playing videogames with, respectively, English
oral input, English written input, and English oral and written
input on, e.g., computer, tablet or other electronic media such a
telephone, Nintendo, and PlayStation; (c) Listening: music in
English; (d) Reading: English books, cartoons, magazines or internet webpages; (e) Speaking in English: e.g., with family, friends or
on skype; and (f) Writing: e.g., chats, stories and mails; songs in
English. Answer options were half-hour intervals from 0 to 6
hours and above 6 hours. For factors (a) and (b), respectively,
the scores of the three subtypes of activities were averaged (e.g.,
films with L1, L2, and no subtitles). Additionally, the questionnaire included questions about parents' SES, operationalized as
total yearly income of the child's caregiver(s) and highest level
of household education attained, and their self-evaluation of
English skills and their frequency of English use in their daily
lives. The two questionnaires (viz., about child-specific factors
and environmental factors) were administered between the first
and the second data collection waves.
Data analysis
Data from the two waves as described below were stacked and
analyzed with a mixed effects model, i.e., a generalized linear
regression model with wave as a repeated measure and a random
effect for subject (e.g., Linck & Cunnings, 2015), assuming a normal distribution of the outcome measures (the module MEGLM
in Stata). Fixed effects were implemented as indicator variables
for wave (wave 2 versus wave 1), gender (boy versus girl), and

starting grade (ES vs. LS). A number of other explanatory variables (see Table S1) were included and interaction terms between
the above-mentioned effects and these variables were examined.
To arrive at the best fitting model, we took as our starting
point the fitted model from our previous study of the influence
of several child-specific factors on receptive vocabulary and grammar scores (Fenyvesi et al., 2020). The previous study concerned
the first two waves of data collection (Fall of 2014 and 2015)
whereas the present study concerned the last two waves (Fall of
2015 and 2016) - referred to here as waves 1 and 2 as mentioned
above. For the current study, we added new child-specific factors,
i.e., the memory components of language aptitude (digit span and
number learning) and the environmental factors, including
potential interactions with starting grade and gender. We proceeded by manual backward elimination, i.e., by repeated elimination of non-significant interaction terms and then
non-significant main effects. The choice of individual variables
to be considered for elimination from one model to the next
was based on significance-level. Non-significance was assessed
by p > .10 to avoid being too conservative, as is typically done
in the case of model-fitting in exploratory studies (Fisher,
1925). Lower-order terms and main effects that were part of a significant interaction effect were kept regardless of significance
level. The final variables in the fitted models are described in
Table S1. Table S3 shows the correlations between the included
predictors. No correlations exceeded .51.
Results
Table 1 reports the raw scores at waves 1 and 2 for the PPVT and
TROG. The pattern of results for the two outcome measures bore
close resemblance so we present them concurrently. In the following sections, we report the results in terms of raw scores together
with estimates and their significance levels as obtained from the
fitted models. Tables 2 and 3 show the estimated statistical models
for the PPVT and TROG outcome measures, respectively. Note
that these are the results of the model fitting process described
above where a number of the factors included did not reach our
criterion for significance. Among these was, for example, the
total number of hours of instruction, as described above, which
varied between schools. We refer the reader to Fenyvesi et al.
(2020) for a discussion.
Child-specific factors
In relation to child-specific factors, we first noted that the models
indicated a difference in receptive vocabulary depending on the
starting grade. Both for the PPVT and TROG, the scores of all
participants increased from Wave 1 to 2. There was also a main
effect of starting grade: LS scored significantly better than the
ES. For both measures, the main effects were moderated by a significant interaction between starting grade and wave. As shown in
Table 2, for the PPVT the difference between ES and LS was 15.00
points at Wave 1 but 21.89 points at wave 2, thus the LS' scores increased by 6.89 points more than the ES' scores (estimate: -9.41,
z = -2.89, p = .004). The same pattern was found for the TROG.
The difference between ES and LS was 11.61 points at Wave 1
but 17.83 points at wave 2, thus the LS' scores increased by 6.22
points more than the ES' scores (estimate: -7.79, z = -3.92,
p < .001).
Overall, there was no significant main effect of gender for
either of the measures. However, for the PPVT, there was a

significant interaction between gender and wave: The boys'
scores increased significantly more than girls from Wave 1 to
2 overall, by an estimated difference of 9.61, z = 2.93, p = .003).
For the TROG, in contrast to the PPVT, the interaction between
wave and gender did not reach significance (estimate: 2.87, z =
1.54, p = .123), although the difference was in the same direction,
i.e., an estimated difference of 2.87 points in favour of the boys.
In contrast to the PPVT, there was a significant interaction
between gender and starting grade (estimate: -12.70, z = -3.98,
p < .001), indicating that LS boys regardless of wave had a
12-point advantage over ES boys; a bigger difference than that
found for LS vs. ES girls. For a more detailed analysis, see
Cadierno et al. (2020).

We now turn to the memory components underlying language
aptitude, i.e., the digit span tests (forward and backward) and the
number learning subtest of the MLAT-E. For forward digit span,
for each step of increase in these scores, children's PPVT scores
rose by 0.99 points (z = 1.33, p = .184) and their TROG scores
rose by 0.93 (z = 1.84, p = .066). For backward digit span, the
increase was 1.48 (z = 1.71, p = .088) for the PPVT and 1.50
(z = 2.25, p = .024) for the TROG. Despite some measures not
meeting conventional statistical significance levels, we note in particular that the size and direction of the coefficients were quite
similar for both outcome measures. For number learning, the
increase was 0.28 points (z = 2.23, p = .026) on the PPVT and
0.29 (z = 2.49, p = .013) on the TROG.

Of the various affective and motivational variables, two rose to
our cut-off significance-level in the fitted models. For FLCA, there
was a significant main effect for the TROG and a tendency
towards conventional statistical significance for the PPVT
(PPVT: estimate: 6.91, z = 1.70, p = .089, TROG: estimate: 11.14,
z = 3.29, p < .001). For ECB, there was a significant main effect
for both outcome measures (PPVT: estimate: 14.70, z = 4.13,
p < .001; TROG: estimate: 16.37, z = 5.50, p < .001). However,
the effects of FLCA and ECB were moderated by a significant
interaction between them (PPVT: estimate: -2.33, z = -2.12,
p = .034; TROG: estimate: -3.33, z = -3.60, p < .001). There were
no other interactions involving these two factors.
The differential impact of ECB depending on the level of
FCLA for both PPVT and TROG is illustrated in Figures 1A
and 1B. For students with high scores on the ECB items, i.e.,
the red line showing the upper tertile of ECB scores, and low
levels of FLCA, the ECB scores corresponded roughly to high
PPVT and TROG scores, i.e., a strong belief in one's selfcompetence in English corresponded to high proficiency scores.
However, students with high ECB who also scored high on the
FLCA items tended to obtain lower proficiency scores regardless
of their high beliefs in their own competences. In contrast, for students with low ECB (i.e., the blue line showing the lower tertile of
ECB scores), their proficiency scores were lower than the students
with high ECB overall. The level of FLCA had little estimated
impact on their proficiency scores. As can be seen by the

confidence intervals shown on the slope of the different levels
of FLCA for students with low ECB, the estimated points may
overlap, indicating uncertainty whether the slope in fact rises or
is flat.

Environmental factors
Regarding children's contact with English outside the classroom,
three factors had an impact on children's proficiency scores. First,
the composite score of exposure to English language audiovisual
media (Films) interacted significantly with starting grade. We
have illustrated the differences, dichotomizing the actual scores
into 1 hour or less and more than 1 hour of watching films in
Figures S1 A and B. Relative to the other factors in the model,
watching audiovisual material only had a significant impact on
the ES. On the PPVT, the difference in raw scores was 13.52
points for the ES, and 1.93 points for the LS (estimate: 5.39,
z = 3.42, p < .001). On the TROG, the difference was 12.37 points
for the ES and 6.02 points for the LS (estimate: 3.30, z = 2.57,
p = .010). There was no main effect of films for either outcome
measure, but recall from the presentation of the model that
there was a significant effect of starting grade.
Second, the amount of time spent reading in English out of
school interacted significantly with starting grade. Figures S2
A and B illustrate the difference in the two outcome measures

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

573

Figure 1. Estimated means on the PPVT (A) and TROG (B), as a function of Foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA) at two different levels of English competence
beliefs (ECB; upper and lower tertiles of scores with 95% confidence intervals).

in actual scores for those not reading at all outside the classroom
compared to those reading more than 30 minutes per week outside the classroom. On the PPVT, while the scores of the ES
were relatively uninfluenced by the amount of time spent reading
outside the classroom (the difference in actual scores was -2.57
points), for the LS, those reading more than 30 minutes per week
outside the classroom had an advantage of 5.05 points compared
to those who read less than 30 minutes per week (estimate:
-5.87, z = -3.59, p < .001). For the TROG, the pattern was the
same. While the ES showed a minor difference of -1.47 between
reading less than 30 minutes vs. more, the LS showed a difference
of 5.00 points in actual scores (estimate: -3.71, z = -2.83, p = .005).
There were no main effects of reading.
The third environmental factor that met our cut-off criterion was
the amount of time spent speaking English outside the classroom,
which showed a significant interaction with gender. The interaction,
as well as a main effect in the case of the PPVT, is illustrated in actual
scores in Figures S3 A and B. For the PPVT everybody benefited
from speaking English outside the classroom regardless of gender
(estimate: -3.25, z = -2.87, p = .004). In addition, boys that spoke
English more than 1 hour outside the classroom obtained 4.54 points
more on the PPVT in actual scores relative to those speaking less
than 1 hour compared to girls for whom the increase was 1.47 points
(estimate: 3.61, z = -0.9, p = .050). For the TROG, there was no
main effect of speaking English outside the classroom (estimate:
-.80, z = -.97, p = .331) - however, it was still the case that boys
benefited more than girls from this activity. Boys speaking more
than 1 hour obtained 6.54 points more on the TROG than
those speaking less than hour per week. For girls, the increase
was 2.51 points on the TROG (estimate: 3.90, z = 3.39, p < .001).
Regarding the remaining environmental factors, only the total
yearly income of the child's caregivers was significant in the fitted
model. Income was reported in units of 1000s of Danish kroner.
The results showed that for every increase in income of 15,000
Danish kroner per year (roughly equal to 2000 euros), students'
PPVT score increased by 1 point (estimate: 0.015, z = 2.11,
p = .035). For the TROG, the corresponding figure was an increase
in 11,000 Danish kroner per year (roughly equal to 1500 euros;
estimate: 0.011, z = 2.08, p = .037).

Finally, we examined the relative influence of child-specific vs.
environmental factors in predicting proficiency (see Sun et al.,
2016). To obtain the percentage of the variance explained by
these two blocks of factors, we used the same two statistical models as previously, leaving out the random factor, to calculate the
change in R 2 between the full models (PPVT: R 2 = .55; TROG:
R 2 = .65) and versions of the models without the block of environmental factors (PPVT: R 2 = .42; TROG: R 2 = .53) and basic
models that included just the factor Wave, which was a feature
of the design (PPVT: R 2 = .06; TROG: R 2 = .12). The environmental factors, then, explained 13% of the total variance for the PPVT
and 12% for the TROG. The child-specific factors explained 36%
of the total variance for the PPVT and 41% for the TROG.
Discussion
The present study examined the role of two sets of factors in
Danish children's development of L2 English receptive vocabulary
and grammar skills: (a) child-specific factors and (b) environmental factors, the latter comprising children's contact with English
outside the classroom and parental SES, parents' knowledge of
English, and their use of English in their daily lives. In addition,
the study asked whether the role of the various factors was the
same for the two language measures.
Child-specific factors
Regarding the child-specific factors, age of onset, gender, the
memory components of language aptitude, FL competence beliefs
and FL classroom anxiety had the biggest impact on the outcome
measures. That is, the various measures of learners' motivation
and mindset did not reach our criterion for significance relative
to the other factors. Concerning age of onset, for both measures,
LS scored significantly higher than ES. In addition, the significant
interaction between age of onset and wave indicated that the
advantage of the LS increased over time (after one year of instruction). This is evidence of a rate advantage for the LS over the ES
with respect to receptive vocabulary and grammar skills. A similar
pattern was present in the analyses of a part of the same data

574

reported by Cadierno et al. (2020), although for receptive vocabulary, it only approached statistical significance whereas in the present study it was significant when other factors were included in
the model. Our results support a consistent finding in previous
research conducted in instructed settings - namely, the faster
rate of learning of older learners in several language dimensions,
including vocabulary (Munoz, 2020b; Pfenninger & Singleton,
2017) and grammar-related tasks (e.g., Jaekel et al., 2017;
Pfenninger & Singleton, 2017). The older learners' rate advantage
may be due to their more advanced level of cognitive development
and increased use of explicit learning mechanisms which develop
with age (see Munoz, 2006).
As for gender, there was a general advantage of boys compared
to girls. For receptive vocabulary, the significant interaction
between gender and wave indicates that boys' scores increased significantly more than those of the girls. For receptive grammar, the
significant interaction between gender and starting grade suggests
that, regardless of wave, LS boys obtained significantly higher
scores than ES boys relative to the difference between LS and
ES girls. These results are in line with those of Cadierno et al.
(2020), and a study conducted in Sweden by Sylven and
Sundqvist (2012) who found that boys outperformed girls regarding L2 English vocabulary. They suggest that this advantage may
be due to more time spent on gaming, a connection also made by
Hannibal Jensen (2017), as discussed further below.
Regarding the memory components of language aptitude,
there was some indication of an influence of the digit span tests
and the MLAT-E measures, suggesting that various aspects of
memory as measured by these tests (phonological short-term
and working memory and rote learning abilities) play a role in
the development of children's English receptive skills. Our findings
are in line with previous studies showing that language aptitude
including its memory components is a significant predictor of children's L2 development both in classroom and naturalistic contexts,
and for different language dimensions such as vocabulary and
grammar (e.g., Munoz, 2014; Paradis, 2011; Unsworth et al., 2015).
FLCA had a negative impact on both outcome measures
(although more so for receptive grammar). To some extent, this
result mirrors previous research showing that the higher the
FLCA, the lower the L2 learning outcome (see Botes,
Dewaele & Greiff, 2020, for a recent meta-analysis). However,
the above effects were moderated by a significant interaction
between FLCA and ECB for both outcomes. That FLCA is closely
related to children's achievement-related self-concept has also
been shown by Heinzmann (2013).1 The results of the present
study support that finding but crucially relate it to outcome scores
both for TROG and PPVT: ECB scores were a significant predictor of both language outcomes, but this was only the case
for children with low FLCA. In the case of high FLCA, even children with strong beliefs in their own competences in English
obtained lower outcome scores (see Figures 1A and B). Thus,
high ECB was overridden by high FLCA.
The paradox of having high ECB yet obtaining low proficiency
scores could be seen in the light of recent calls for the need to
think of child-specific factors not as independent factors but as
dynamic characteristics that interact with each other in multiple
ways (Dewaele & Pavelescu, 2019; MacIntyre, 2017). For students
with high ECB but a low score in actual L2 proficiency, high
FLCA (e.g., being afraid of speaking up in class and of being corrected) may shield them from receiving feedback that could lower
their competence beliefs. Thus, they are able to maintain a selfimage as being competent in English by not getting evidence to

Teresa Cadierno et al.

the contrary. However, they may then not receive the necessary
feedback to develop their L2 skills (for a discussion of the role
of feedback on L2 proficiency, see Lyster & Saito, 2010).
Environmental factors
In relation to the environmental factors, the results of the study
showed that of all the factors dealing with the effects of extramural English, watching English audiovisual material, reading,
and speaking in English were significant factors in explaining
receptive vocabulary and grammatical proficiency. With respect
to the former, the significant interaction between this factor and
starting grade (age of onset) for both language measures suggests
that viewing audiovisual input was mainly beneficial for the ES.
A beneficial effect of watching audiovisual material on L2 learning
has been widely documented in previous research conducted
with younger and older learners (e.g., d'Ydewalle & Van de
Poel, 1999; Lindgren & Munoz, 2013; Munoz et al., 2018). Our
results do not suggest that watching films is NOT beneficial for
the LS, only that relative to the other significant factors in the
model, this factor is more important for the ES, cf. the reverse pattern below for reading. This finding emphasizes the important
role of watching audiovisual input from the early stages of L2
learning.
With regard to extramural reading in English, our results suggest that relative to all the other factors, this type of activity was
mainly beneficial for the LS group. As noted by De Wilde et al.
(2020), the beneficial effect of informal extramural reading on
children's acquisition of English has been quite limited. The
results of our study suggest that a beneficial effect may be linked
to the learners' level of L1 literacy and L2 proficiency. Presumably,
the reading skills of the ES group were not advanced enough to
take advantage of reading in an L2. In fact, several researchers
have claimed that L2 reading is aided by the transference of
knowledge and skills (e.g., metacognitive knowledge and reading
strategies) acquired from L1 reading (e.g., Carrell, 1991;
Cummins, 1991). In relation to the level of L2 proficiency, the
ES group, which exhibited lower levels of English receptive
vocabulary and grammar than their LS counterparts, may not
have had sufficient L2 proficiency to profit from informal reading.
In fact, the interplay between readers' L1 literacy skills and L2
knowledge resources in successful L2 reading has been stressed
by contemporary approaches to L2 reading (e.g., Bernhardt,
2011; Grabe, 2009). A combined effect of the ES's poorer L1 reading skills and lack of sufficient L2 knowledge would explain why
informal reading outside the classroom was only a significant predictor for the LS group, who had higher L2 proficiency and who
were presumably more proficient readers.
The interaction of extramural speaking in English and gender
for both outcome measures suggests that speaking English outside
the classroom context was beneficial for boys rather than girls.
A possible explanation for this finding may be related to the
higher amount of time spent on gaming by boys vis-a-vis girls
(e.g., Hannibal Jensen, 2017). According to Sundqvist (2016),
this pattern may be due to gender-role stereotyping (i.e., gaming
being associated with masculine culture) and a lack of female
characters available in games. It may also be due to the relationship between gender and type of games. In a survey conducted in
Denmark, Thorhauge and Gregersen (2015) found that boys
played multi-player games significantly more often than girls
who tended to play single-player games. Research has shown
that when playing multi-player online games, learners often

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition

practice the language through interaction with native or more fluent speakers as they use the audio-chat functions afforded by
these types of games (e.g., Rama, Black, van Es & Warschauer,
2012; Sylven & Sundqvist, 2012). However, the gaming measures
did not rise to significance in the current study relative to the
other factors (but see Hannibal Jensen, 2017).
All in all, the findings of this study regarding contact with
English outside the classroom support usage-based accounts of
L2 learning. It can be argued that watching audiovisual material
provided Danish learners with ample opportunities to experience
high token frequencies of particular linguistic items (both at the
lexical and grammatical level) and high type frequencies of various linguistic material in given constructions, thus facilitating the
implicit learning of the L2 (see Munoz et al., 2018, for a similar
explanation).
Regarding the remaining environmental factors, the results of
the present study showed that only total yearly caregiver income
played a significant role as an indicator of SES. This finding supports previous studies which have identified SES as an important
predictor in L2 acquisition (e.g., Butler & Le, 2018; Goldberg
et al., 2008). Even though most research has operationalized SES
in terms of maternal education and have found this to be a significant predictor in learners' language development (e.g., Bornstein &
Bradley, 2003), the results of the present study suggest that even in a
country like Denmark, with one of the lowest degrees of income
inequality in the world (OECD, 2016), SES as measured by income
may still be a factor in predicting L2 learning.
Role of child-specific vs. environmental factors
Finally, when comparing the relative weight of the child-specific
and environmental factors on Danish children's receptive vocabulary and grammar, the results of the present study showed that
child-specific factors explained more of the variance in English
proficiency than environmental factors. Previous research on
the relative weight of internal vs. external factors on L2 learning
has found different results for L2 learning in naturalistic
input-rich environments vs. instructed settings, with a bigger
role for internal factors in the former type of setting (e.g.,
Paradis, 2011; Sun, Bornstein & Esposito, 2021) and external factors in the latter (e.g., Sun et al., 2016). Notwithstanding differences in design and factors included, in our study, conducted in
an instructed setting but with a high presence of English in society, internal factors were found to play a more important role
than external factors. This finding provides support for claims
made in the literature concerning the special status of English
in some European countries like the Netherlands or the Nordic
countries (Cadierno et al., 2020; de Bot, 2014).
Additionally, this finding may be interpreted as providing support for the relative weight hypothesis (Sun et al., 2018), according
to which input-rich contexts would allow learners' internal
resources to manifest themselves, and likewise, for the critical
mass hypothesis (e.g., Gathercole & Hoff, 2007), according to
which learners need to be exposed to ample L2 input for other
factors to be able to contribute to language learning. As argued
by Sun et al. (2018), in naturalistic input-rich environments, children are exposed to ample L2 input that provides "the requisite
amount and quality of input for internal mechanisms to contribute to language learning" (p. 389). In contrast, in traditional FL
environments with limited access to L2 input, "the outcome of
language learning then is determined primarily by the quantity
and quality of input at the initial period" (p. 389). As children

575

in Denmark are exposed to a considerable amount of English outside the classroom, their L2 input level may arguably have
exceeded the requisite amount of input threshold that is needed
for internal factors to gain a more prominent role, thus explaining
the similar pattern found in the present study and in studies conducted in naturalistic L2 contexts.
In relation to the second research question about the differential impact of the predictors on the two outcome measures, i.e.,
receptive vocabulary and grammar, the results revealed that the
role of the different factors was very similar. This finding is in
line with previous studies (e.g., Paradis, 2011; Sun et al., 2016;
but see, e.g., Chondrogianni & Marinis, 2011, for a different
result) where the same patterns were largely found for lexical
and morphosyntactic development, and supports usage-based
accounts of L2 learning (e.g., Bybee, 2008; Cadierno &
Eskildsen, 2015) where no rigid division is posited between lexis
and grammar (Langacker, 1987).
Conclusion
The present study adopted a multi-factor perspective on the study
of English language learning by young Danish children. A distinguishing feature was its longitudinal design. Potential predictors
of gains in receptive vocabulary and grammar were studied over
time in relation to a series of factors divided into child-specific
and environmental factors.
Regarding child-specific factors, the LS had better scores and
additionally exhibited a rate advantage for both outcomes.
Furthermore, better outcomes for boys over girls could be seen
in two ways: (1) For receptive vocabulary, boys' scores increased
more than girls' scores (an additional rate advantage). (2) For
receptive grammar, the difference between LS boys and ES boys
was significantly bigger than the difference between LS and ES
girls, regardless of wave. Language aptitude as measured by tests
of digit-span and the number learning subtest of the MLAT-E
predicted both outcome measures. Children's beliefs in their
own competence in English positively predicted their proficiency.
However, this was only the case for children with low FLCA, as
the results once again showed the detrimental influence of high
FLCA: even a strong belief in one's English competence was overridden by high FLCA. With regard to environmental factors,
viewing audiovisual material in English outside of the classroom
was beneficial for the ES, whereas reading in English outside
the classroom was beneficial for the LS. Speaking English outside
school was beneficial for boys. Increase in SES as measured by
household income also predicted both language measures.
The results showed that child-specific factors explained more
of the variance than environmental factors. This has important
implications for research on child L2 learning and bilingualism:
It points to the need to go beyond the categorical distinction
between naturalistic and instructed settings when examining the
role of child-specific vs. environmental factors in child L2 acquisition/bilingualism research. As we detail below when outlining
the pedagogical implications of our study, adopting a less categorical perspective which takes into account the specific aspects of
the learning context as well as child-specific factors has important
consequences for supporting L2 development in children.
The study has some limitations. Although longitudinal, it
spanned only 1 year, so we can only speak to short-term proficiency, as measured by picture selection tests. Future research
may determine if the LS starter advantage (and advantage of
boys) holds up over time when using other types of tests. In

576

relation to the psychological constructs studied, the limited number of items for each construct in the questionnaire may entail a
less rich operationalization of the constructs than would be feasible
in a questionnaire for adults. In addition, retrospective self-reported
answers, which were used for the environmental factors, may not
have been fine-grained enough to capture all of children's daily
English-related activities. The lack of quantitative data on classroom
language use by the teachers and the children is also a limitation of
the present study. Some of the differences in children's linguistic
outcomes might be explained by teachers' aims and pedagogical
choices, as shown by Unsworth et al. (2014). Finally, children's
Danish proficiency was not integrated in the analyses.
With these caveats in mind, the findings of the present study
point to several pedagogical implications. In relation to childspecific factors, the results are in line with previous research indicating little advantage of introducing English earlier in primary
school. In addition, they once again point to the need to promote
a low anxiety classroom environment that fosters low evaluative
pressure (MacIntyre, 1999). In relation to the environmental factors, the results point to the importance of increasing teachers'
awareness of the facilitative role of watching material from the
beginning of English instruction as well as promoting reading in
the L2 once children have reached a more advanced level of L1 literacy. Our results also support previous claims in the literature
about the importance of raising children's and parents' awareness
of the opportunities for language learning outside the schools and
of integrating these out-of-classroom activities into the FL classroom (e.g., Munoz & Lindgren, 2011; Munoz et al., 2018).
