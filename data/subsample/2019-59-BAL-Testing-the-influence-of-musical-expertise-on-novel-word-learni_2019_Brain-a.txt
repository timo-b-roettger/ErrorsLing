Word learning is a multifaceted perceptual and cognitive task that is omnipresent in everyday life. Currently, it is
unclear whether this ability is influenced by age, musical expertise or both variables. Accordingly, we used EEG
and compared behavioral and electrophysiological indices of word learning between older adults with and
without musical expertise (older adults' perspective) as well as between musically trained and untrained children, young adults, and older adults (lifespan perspective). Results of the older adults' perspective showed that
the ability to learn new words is preserved in elderly, however, without a beneficial influence of musical expertise. Otherwise, results of the lifespan perspective revealed lower error rates and faster reaction times in
young adults compared to children and older adults. Furthermore, musically trained children and young adults
outperformed participants without musical expertise, and this advantage was accompanied by EEG manifestations reflecting faster learning and neural facilitation in accessing lexical-semantic representations.

1. Introduction
The aging human brain is characterized by grey (Crivello, TzourioMazoyer, Tzourio, & Mazoyer, 2014; Jancke, Merillat, Liem, & Hanggi,
2015) and white (Bender, Volkle, & Raz, 2016; Hirsiger et al., 2016)
matter changes in cortical (Crivello et al., 2014) and subcortical
(Ziegler et al., 2012) brain regions. Such anatomical alterations are
accompanied by an inter-individual variable decline of several cognitive functions (Shafto & Tyler, 2014), including attention (Erel & Levy,
2016; Fama & Sullivan, 2015), short-term memory, working memory
(Rhodes & Katz, 2017; Rieckmann, Pudas, & Nyberg, 2017) as well as
episodic memory (Fjell et al., 2016). However, due to compensatory
functional mechanisms that are reflected by the recruitment of auxiliary
brain regions or increased functional connectivity, there is no simple
relationship between aging, brain changes and the preservation of
cognitive functions (Shafto & Tyler, 2014). Furthermore, although older
adults often demonstrate auditory dysfunctions (Giroud et al., 2018)

that render speech processing in noisy environments particularly difficult (Coffey, Mogilever, & Zatorre, 2017), core language functions like
lexical-semantic access and syntactic processing are relatively unaffected by aging (Shafto & Tyler, 2014). Nevertheless, since increased
longevity is generally associated with a higher prevalence of cognitive
impairments that lead to social and healthcare burden (Rechel et al.,
2013), there is increased interest in the scientific community to test the
influence of different leisure activities on brain parameters and cognitive functions (Lazarou et al., 2017; Olsen et al., 2015; Rogenmoser,
Kernbach, Schlaug, & Gaser, 2018).
In the last decades, the investigation of professional musicians
(Bermudez, Lerch, Evans, & Zatorre, 2009; Jancke, 2009; Schon,
Magne, & Besson, 2004) and children undergoing music training
(Magne, Schon, & Besson, 2006; Zuk, Benjamin, Kenyon, & Gaab, 2014)
has attracted increasing attention in the field of cognitive neuroscience.
A main reason for the attractiveness of this field of research is that
professional musicians are particularly suited to be used as in vivo

model for evaluating functional and structural brain changes that are
mediated by a high amount of deliberate practice (Ericsson, Krampe, &
Heizmann, 2007; Krampe & Ericsson, 1996). Currently, there is evidence from both cross-sectional studies in adults (Bangert & Schlaug,
2006; Elmer, Hanggi, Meyer, & Jancke, 2013; Schon et al., 2004) and
longitudinal studies in children and adolescents (Chobert, Francois,
Velay, & Besson, 2014; Francois, Chobert, Besson, & Schon, 2013;
Habibi et al., 2017; Linnavalli, Putkinen, Lipsanen, Huotilainen, &
Tervaniemi, 2018; Moreno et al., 2009; Musacchia, Sams, Skoe, &
Kraus, 2007; Tierney, Krizman, & Kraus, 2015) indicating that music
training promotes functional and structural changes in the primary and
associative auditory cortex (Elmer, Meyer, & Jancke, 2012; Schneider,
Sluming, Roberts, Bleeck, & Rupp, 2005), motor- and somatosensory
cortex (Bangert & Schlaug, 2006; Munte, Altenmuller, & Jancke, 2002),
ventral and dorsal parts of the prefrontal cortex (Bermudez et al., 2009;
Sluming, Brooks, Howard, Downes, & Roberts, 2007) as well as in inferior-parietal brain regions (Bermudez et al., 2009) and in the corpus
callosum (Elmer, Hanggi, & Jancke, 2016; Schlaug, Jancke, Huang, &
Steinmetz, 1995). Such functional and structural alterations as a function of music training have also been shown to be related to superior
auditory perception (Kraus & Chandrasekaran, 2010; Seppanen,
Hamalainen, Pesonen, & Tervaniemi, 2013; Vuust, Brattico, Seppanen,
Naatanen, & Tervaniemi, 2012), several aspects of speech processing
(Besson, Chobert, & Marie, 2011) as well as to an optimization of
cognitive functioning (Dittinger et al., 2016; Schulze & Koelsch, 2012;
Zuk et al., 2014). In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that
musicians often demonstrate behavioral and functional advantages in
processing acoustic cues varying in pitch, voice-onset time, duration
and prosody (Chobert et al., 2014; Elmer et al., 2013; Kuhnis, Elmer,
Meyer, & Jancke, 2013; Magne et al., 2006; Schon et al., 2004) as well
as in encoding lexical tones (Chandrasekaran, Krishnan, & Gandour,
2009; Marie et al., 2011; Wong, Skoe, Russo, Dees, & Kraus, 2007).
Music training has previously also been associated with an amelioration
of short-term memory-, working memory-, and attention functions
(Schulze & Koelsch, 2012; Strait, Slater, O'Connell, & Kraus, 2015; Zuk
et al., 2014). Furthermore, it has been proposed that music training
might decelerate the effects of brain aging (Rogenmoser et al., 2018),
postpone age-related temporal speech processing deficits (ParberyClark, Anderson, Hittner, & Kraus, 2012) and have a beneficial effect on
speech-in-noise perception and working memory functions (ParberyClark, Skoe, Lam, & Kraus, 2009; Zendel & Alain, 2012).
Learning the meaning of novel words constitutes a multifaceted task
that relies on several functions, including phonological perception and
categorization, short-term memory, lexical-semantic access and focused
attention (Dittinger et al., 2016). Recently, Dittinger and colleagues
(Dittinger et al., 2016; Dittinger, Chobert, Ziegler, and Besson, 2017;
Dittinger, Valizadeh, Jancke, Besson, and Elmer, 2017) evaluated word
learning in young adults and children with and without musical expertise using concatenated tasks and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs).
In these studies, the participants had to (1) categorize monosyllabic
Thai words varying in terms of non-native phonetic contrasts, (2) learn
the meaning of novel words through picture-word associations (i.e.,
learning phase), (3) judge whether combinations of pictures and words
matched or mismatched those previously learned (i.e., matching task),
and (4) to generalize the meaning of the learned words to semantically
affine pictures (i.e., semantic task; see Fig. 1). The results of these
previous studies consistently revealed a faster development of the N200
and N400 components during novel word learning in musically-trained
compared to untrained individuals that was accompanied by higher
level of performance in the semantic task (Dittinger et al., 2016;
Dittinger, Chobert, et al., 2017). Furthermore, during the matching and
semantic tasks only musicians demonstrated a posterior N400 effect
reflecting the integration of the newly learned words into lexical-semantic memory (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011).
N200 and N400 EEG manifestations typically emerge around 200
and 400 ms after stimulus onset and enable to capture distinct aspects

Fig. 1. Experimental design. (A) Participants learned novel words through
picture-word associations. (B) Afterwards, participants performed two tasks
consisting of deciding whether the presented pictures and words matched or
mismatched the previously learned associations (matching task), and whether
novel pictures were semantically related or unrelated to the learned words
(semantic task).

of speech and language processing (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). The
N200 component has been associated with phonological processing
(Connolly & Phillips, 1994; Friedrich & Friederici, 2008) and early
lexical selection processes (van den Brink, Brown, & Hagoort, 2001),
whereas the N400 component reflects verbal memory functions and
lexical-semantic access (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). Previous work has
repeatedly shown that the N400 component increases in amplitude
when meaningless items acquire a meaning (McLaughlin, Osterhout, &
Kim, 2004; Perfetti, Wlotko, & Hart, 2005) and that its amplitude is
related to increased working memory capacity (Salisbury, 2004). Furthermore, N400 amplitudes are usually larger to low- compared to
high-frequency words (Van Petten & Kutas, 1990), to pseudowords
compared to words and to words that are preceded by semanticallyunrelated compared to related words or sentence contexts (Kutas &
Hillyard, 1980). This N400 effect is typically larger over central-parietal electrodes and is commonly considered as a suitable marker for
lexical-semantic access (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011).
The investigation of the cognitive and neural processes underlying
word learning constitutes a newsworthy topic (Havas, Laine, &
Rodriguez Fornells, 2017; Rodriguez-Fornells, Cunillera, Mestres-Misse,
& de Diego-Balaguer, 2009) and several research questions have not yet
been addressed. The first objective of this study was to determine
whether the previously reported beneficial effects of musical expertise
on word learning in children and young professional musicians
(Dittinger et al., 2016; Dittinger, Chobert, et al., 2017) are likewise
preserved in older adults (i.e., older adults' perspective). Should this be
the case, then it is reasonable to assume that musical expertise can
possibly help to counteract aging-related cognitive and neural decline.
Based on the previous results of Dittinger and colleagues (Dittinger
et al., 2016; Dittinger, Chobert, et al., 2017), we expected that older
adult with musical expertise would outperform age-matched non-musicians, and that this superiority would be reflected by a faster development of the N200 and N400 components in the learning phase as well
as by lower error rates, faster reaction times and increased N400 effects
in the matching and semantic tasks. The second objective of our work
was to evaluate the developmental trajectory (i.e., lifespan perspective)
of word learning across the lifespan and its interactions with musical
expertise. In order to address this purpose, we additionally compared

Accordingly, the data of the older adult participants were compared
with those previously collected by Dittinger and colleagues in children
(i.e., musically trained and untrained children; Dittinger, Chobert,
et al., 2017) and young adults (i.e., professional MUS and NM; Dittinger
et al., 2016). Twelve musically-trained children (i.e., six girls) and 11
children without musical expertise (i.e., five girls) who did not differ in
age (MUS: mean age = 11.1 years, SD = 1.1; NM: mean
age = 10.4 years, SD = 1.7; F(1,21) = 1.84, p = 0.19) were tested. For
the young adult sample, 15 professional MUS (eight women) and 15
NM (eight women) of similar age were tested (MUS: mean
age = 25.1 years, SD = 3.9; NM: mean age = 25.7 years, SD = 4.8;
F(1,28) = 0.02, p = .68). Children practiced music for an average of
4.9 years (SD = 1.1) and young adults for about 17 years (SD = 4.1).
All musically-trained participants (i.e., except one young adult musician) started music training before the age of ten years (age of onset:
children: mean = 5.9 years, SD = 1.0; young adults: mean = 8.1 years,
SD = 2.4). Children and young adults were native French speakers,
none of the children or young adults was bilingual, and all children and
young adults had a similar socio-economic background.

the electrophysiological and behavioral data of the older adults with
those of the children and young adults previously measured by Dittinger and co-workers (Dittinger et al., 2016; Dittinger, Chobert, et al.,
2017). This approach is crucial in that at least three factors that are
known to have an influence on word learning, namely speech perception, vocabulary knowledge, and verbal memory functions are differentially affected by aging (Daneman & Green, 1986). In fact, older
adults are typically characterized by a larger vocabulary compared to
children and young adults (Ferrand, 1998), possibly enabling them to
anchor the meaning of novel words more efficiently on established
lexical-semantic representations. However, at the same time, older
adults are often characterized by hearing impairments (Giroud et al.,
2018) and reduced verbal memory capacity (Cabeza, Anderson,
Locantore, & McIntosh, 2002; Long, Shaw, Lisa, Long, & Shaw, 2000).
Since the latter two factors are expected to mitigate speech processing
and cognitive functioning, we predicted an inverse U-shaped relationship between age and word learning. In particular, we hypothesized
that such a non-linear relationship would be reflected in a superiority of
young adults compared to the other two age cohorts, whereas children
and older adults are expected to perform more similarly. Furthermore,
we predicted that musical expertise might generally have a beneficial
effect on word learning across all age cohorts. In summary, the objective of our work was twofold, namely to assess (1) whether musical
expertise has a protective influence on the aging brain and benefits
word learning, and (2) the developmental trajectory of word learning
across lifespan and interactions with musical expertise.

2.3. Psychometric and biographical data: Older adults' perspective
Cognitive ability: Standardized psychometric tests showed that the
older adult MUS and NM were comparable in crystalline intelligence
(F(1,26) < 1; Mehrfachwahl-Wortschatz-Intelligenztest, "MWT-B",
Lehrl, 1977), fluid intelligence (F(1,26) = 1.72, p = .20; Kurztest fur
allgemeine Intelligenz, "KAI"; Lehrl & Fischer, 1992), verbal memory
and verbal learning abilities (F(1,26) < 1; Verbaler Lern- und Merkfahigkeitstest, VLMT; Helmstaedter, Lendt, & Lux, 2001).
History of music training and musical aptitudes: History of music
training was assessed by an in-house questionnaire (Elmer et al., 2012)
specifically designed to collect data on the age of onset of music
training, the instruments played, the number of years of music training,
and the estimated number of training hours per day/week during every
three-year-period of life. Musical aptitudes were tested by asking participants to judge whether pairs of piano melodies were same or different in terms of melody or rhythm. These two musicality tests (i.e.,
adapted from the MBEA battery, Peretz, Champod, & Hyde, 2003)
confirmed the superiority of MUS compared to NM in the melodic
condition
(percentages
of
error:
MUS:
melody = 10.3%,
rhythm = 8.6%; NM: melody = 25.6%, rhythm = 6.8%; Tukey,
melody = 0.03,
rhythm = 0.98;
Group x Test
interaction:
F(1,24) = 5.85, p = .02).

2. Materials & methods
2.1. Participants: Older adults' perspective
The first objective of this study was to examine the influence of
musical expertise on word learning in a sample of older adults. With
this purpose in mind, we measured 14 older adults that were professional musicians (MUS) and 14 non musicians (NM) who did not differ
in age (MUS: mean age = 60.6 years, SD = 5.7; NM: mean
age = 58.5 years, SD = 6.1; F(1,24) = 0.81, p = .38) and socioeconomic
status (criteria of the National Institute of Statistics and Economic
Studies). Due to EEG artefacts (i.e., movement and muscle artefacts),
two participants had to be excluded from further analyses, resulting in
13 MUS (five women; five pianists, two saxophonists, two clarinetists,
one flautist, one violinist, one harpsichordist and one organist) and 13
NM (six women). None of the participants reported present or past
neurological deficits, and all individuals had normal audiological status
(i.e., all tested frequencies could be heard below a threshold of 30 dB,
frequency-range of 250-8000 Hz) as revealed by pure tone audiometry
(MAICO ST 20, MAICO Diagnostic, GmbH, Berlin). All older adults were
consistent right-handed (Annett, 1970) and native German speakers.
Although bilinguals were excluded, participants spoke on average three
foreign languages (MUS: 3.1, NM: 3.3) but none of them had experience
with Thai or other tonal languages. All MUS started music training
before the age of ten years (mean age of commencement = 6.6 years,
SD = 1.0 years), and at the time of EEG measurements they still practiced their musical instrument for at least two hours a day (mean hours/
day during the last year = 3.1 h, SD = 0.9 h). The MUS had an average
number of 54 practice years (range = 44-64 years, SD = 3.3 years),
whereas NM did not regularly play a musical instrument (i.e., no formal
musical education). The local ethic committee (Ethics Commission of
the Canton of Zurich) approved the study (in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki) and written consent was obtained from all participants who were paid for participation.

2.4. Psychometric and biographical data: Lifespan perspective
Cognitive ability: Due to differences in age and mother tongue between the three cohorts of participants, different tests were used to
evaluate general intelligence in children, young adults and older adults.
The psychometric procedures used in the older adults' sample have
been described in the previous paragraph. Children were tested on the
full version of progressive matrices (PM47; Raven, Corporation, &
Lewis, 1962) and young adults performed an abbreviated version of the
same test. Univariate ANOVAs did not show significant group differences for children (F(1,21) = 3.71, p = 0.07) or young adults (F(1,
28) = 1.37, p = .25).
History of music training and musical aptitudes: the two musicality
tests for melody and rhythm described above (i.e., adapted from the
MBEA battery, Peretz et al., 2003) were used in all three age cohorts.
Results of a 2 x 3 x 2 ANOVA (2 Groups x 3 Ages x 2 Tests) showed
lower error rates in MUS (12.4%) than in NM (21.9%; main effect of
Group: F(1,69) = 15.85, p < .001). Moreover, young and older adults
made significantly fewer errors than children (young adults = 12.0%;
older adults = 14.7%, children = 24.8%; Tukey, both < 0.004; main
effect of Age: F(2,69) = 10.37, p < .001) and participants made overall
fewer errors in the rhythm (12.0%) than in the melody task (22.4%;

2.2. Participants: Lifespan perspective
The second objective of this work was to compare the influence of
musical expertise on novel word learning across the lifespan.

different pictures were associated with different words. During this
learning phase, no behavioral response was required, but the participants were informed that they would be tested on how well they
learned the picture-word associations. In this study, we deliberately
decided to focus on the learning of novel words based on familiar objects instead of learning novel words for novel concepts because it is
cognitively less demanding, especially for older participants.
Matching task: In the matching task, participants were exposed to
one of the nine pictures that were followed, after 750 ms (SOA), by one
of the words that matched or mismatched the previously learned associations. For instance, while the drawing of an eye followed by
/pha1/ (i.e., eye) was a match, the drawing of a flower followed by
/pha1/ was a mismatch (see Fig. 1B). Participants were asked to press
one out of two response keys on an in-house made response box as
quickly and accurately as possible (i.e., response hand was counterbalanced across participants). Furthermore, at the end of each trial a
row of "X" appeared on the screen, and participants were asked to blink
during this time period (1000 ms; total trial duration: 3750 ms) in order
to minimize eye movement artifacts during word presentation. Each
word was presented 20 times, 10 times in match- and mismatch conditions. The total of 180 trials was pseudo-randomly presented (i.e., no
immediate repetition of the same association and no more than four
successive same responses) within two blocks of 5.6 min each. Since
during the learning phase we did not collect behavioral responses, the
matching task was used to objectify and quantify learning.
Semantic task: During the semantic task, new pictures of familiar
concepts that were semantically related or unrelated to those previously
learned were presented. The presentation of a new picture was followed
(SOA = 1500 ms) by a semantically related or unrelated word. For instance, while the picture of glasses was semantically related to the
previously learned word /pha1/ (i.e., eye), the picture of a watering can
was semantically unrelated to /pha1/ (see Fig. 1B). Participants were
asked to press one out of two response keys on an in-house made response box as quickly and accurately as possible. A familiarization task
including four trials was administrated before starting the task, and
response hand was counter-balanced across participants. At the end of
the trial a row of "X" appeared on the screen, and participants were
asked to blink during this time period (1000 ms, total trial duration = 4500 ms). Each word was presented 12 times but none of the
new pictures was repeated, so that on each trial the word was associated with a different related or unrelated picture. Half of the pictureword pairs were semantically related and half were semantically unrelated. A total of 108 trials was presented pseudo-randomly (i.e., no
immediate repetition of the same association and no more than four
successive same responses) within two blocks of 4 min each. The purpose of the semantic task was to assess whether the learned words have
been integrated into semantic memory and transferred to pictures with
a similar meaning.

main effect of Test: F(1,69) = 33.83, p < .001).
2.5. Experimental stimuli used for both the older adults' and lifespan
perspectives
Auditory stimuli: Nine natural Thai monosyllabic words were selected for the experiment (the same as those previously used by
Dittinger et al., 2016). These words varied in vowel duration, with short
(/ba1/, /pa1/ and /pha1/; 261 ms on average) and long vowels (/ba:1/
, /pa:1/, /pha:1/, /ba:0/, /pa:0/ and /pha:0/; 531 ms on average),
fundamental frequency, with low-tone (/ba1/, /pa1/, /pha1/, /ba:1/,
/pa:1/ and /pha:1/; F0 = 175 Hz on average) and mid-tone vowels
(/ba:0/, /pa:0/ and /pha:0/; F0 = 218 Hz on average) as well as in
voicing contrasts (/ba1/, /ba:1/ and /ba:0/, Voice Onset Time
(VOT) = -144 ms versus /pa1/, /pa:1/ and /pa:0/, VOT = 3 ms) and
aspiration contrasts (/pa1/, /pa:1/ and /pa:0/, VOT = 3 ms versus
/pha1/, /pha:1/ and /pha:0/, VOT = 77 ms). Stimuli were recorded by
a female Thai-French bilingual. For each word, 5 versions were recorded and presented during the experiment in order to reproduce
natural speech variability. Sound pressure level was normalized across
all words to a mean level of 70 dB by using the Praat software (http://
www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/).
Visual stimuli: For the learning phase, nine pictures representing
familiar objects (i.e., bear, flower, key, chair, bell, eye, strawberry,
train, glass) were selected based on the standardized set of 260 pictures
built by Snodgrass & Vanderwart (Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980).
Pictures were matched for name and image agreement, familiarity, and
visual complexity. The same pictures as in the learning phase were also
presented in the matching task. For the semantic task, 54 new pictures
that the participants had not seen before in the experiment and that
were semantically related or unrelated to the meaning of the newlylearned words were chosen from the internet by two of the authors (ED
and MB). In a pilot experiment, all pictures were pre-tested in a sample
of university students (n = 60; age range = 19-25 years). The participants were asked to rate the semantic relatedness between new and old
pictures on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 corresponding to "not related at
all" and 5 corresponding to "very strongly related" (e.g., picture of a
white bear with picture of an iceberg). Only picture pairs that were
rated with an average score higher than 4 in related conditions and
lower than 2 in unrelated conditions were used in the experiments.
2.6. Experimental tasks used for both the older adults and lifespan
perspectives
Participants were tested individually in a quiet experimental room
(i.e., Faraday cage) while they sat in a comfortable chair at about 1 m
from a computer screen. Auditory stimuli were presented through HiFi
headphones (Sennheiser, HD590) at 70 dB sound pressure level. Visual
and auditory stimuli presentation as well as the collection of behavioral
data was controlled by the Presentation software (Neurobehavioral
Systems, Albany, California, version 11.0).
Learning phase: Participants were instructed to learn the meaning
of the nine words (i.e., in children we only used six words) by means of
picture-word associations. Thereby, we used pictures of familiar concepts. For instance, a drawing of an eye was followed by the word
/pha1/ and thus, /pha1/ was the word corresponding to eye in our
"foreign language" (see Fig. 1A). Each of the nine picture-word pairs
was presented 20 times, resulting in 180 trials that were pseudo-randomly presented (i.e., no immediate repetition of the same association)
in two blocks of 3 min each. However, for better evaluating the electrophysiological dynamics of learning, each block was further divided
into two parts of 45 trials each. Accordingly, the statistical EEG analyses were performed by taking into account 4 blocks. The picture was
presented first followed by one out of nine auditory words (i.e., stimulus-onset asynchrony, SOA = 750 ms) and total trial duration was
2000 ms. Two different lists were used, so that across participants

2.7. EEG data acquisition: Older adults' perspective
The EEG was continuously recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz
with a high-pass filter of 0.1 Hz by using an EEG amplifier system
(Brainproducts, Munich, Germany) with 32 active Ag/Cl electrodes
located at standard positions according to the international 10/20
system (Jasper, 1958). The reference electrode was placed on the tip of
the nose, and electrode impedance was kept below 10 k. EEG data
were analyzed using the Brain Vision Analyzer software (Version
1.05.0005 & Version 2.1.0; Brain Products, GmbH). The data were rereferenced offline to the averaged left and right mastoids, filtered offline with a bandpass filter of 0.1-30 Hz (slope of 24 dB/oct), and independent component analysis (ICA) and inverse ICA were used to
identify and correct vertical and horizontal ocular movements. Furthermore, DC-detrend (length 100 ms) and removal of artifacts above a
maximum-minimum criterion of 75 V over the entire epoch were applied automatically. For each participant, ERPs were computed time4

always included Group (MUS vs. NM) as a between-subject factor and
Anterior/Posterior [mean amplitude frontal (F3, Fz, F4) vs. mean amplitude central (C3, Cz, C4) vs. mean amplitude parietal (P3, Pz, P4)] as
within-subject factor. In addition, the ANOVAs included specific factors
for each task. To capture temporal dynamics during the learning phase,
the ANOVA included the factor Block [Block 1 (trials 1-45) vs. 2 (trials
46-90) vs. 3 (trials 91-135) vs. 4 (trials 136-180)]. By contrast, in the
test phases (i.e., matching and semantic tasks), the factor Condition
(match vs. mismatch or related vs. unrelated) was included in order to
evaluate whether words have been learned. Post-hoc Tukey tests (i.e.,
reducing the probability of Type I errors) were used to determine the
origin of significant main effects or interactions.

locked to the onset of the words, segmented into 1700 ms epochs (i.e.,
including a 200 ms pre-stimulus baseline), and averaged for each condition. Individual averages were then used to compute the grand
average in MUS, NM and all participants. For statistical analyses, mean
amplitudes during the learning phase (N200: 250-350 ms, N400:
350-550 ms), the matching task and the semantic task (N200:
250-350 ms, N400: 350-450 ms) were extracted separately for each
group (MUS and NM) and the different age cohorts (older adults vs.
young adults vs. children). Only trials with correct responses entered
statistical analyses.
2.8. EEG data acquisition: Lifespan perspective
In children and young adults, the EEG was continuously recorded at
a sampling rate of 512 Hz with a band-pass filter of 0-102.4 Hz by using
a Biosemi amplifier system (BioSemi Active 2, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands) with 32 active Ag/Cl electrodes (Biosemi Pintype) located
at standard positions according to the International 10/20 System
(Jasper, 1958). The EOG was recorded from flat-type active electrodes
placed 1 cm to the left and right of the external canthi and from an
electrode beneath the right eye. Two additional electrodes were placed
on the left and right mastoids. Electrode impedance was kept below 5
k. EEG data were analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer software
(Version 1.05.0005; Brain Products, Munchen, Germany). All data were
re-referenced offline to the averaged left and right mastoids. All further
processing steps were the same as for older adults described above,
except that in the children sample all trials were averaged for statistical
analyses instead of only evaluating trials with correct responses. This
procedure enables to improve signal-to-noise ratio which is typically
lower in children due to more noisy ERP traces.

2.10. Statistical analyses: Lifespan perspective
All statistical analyses were performed using ANOVAs (Statistica
software version 12.0, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa). ERRs, RTs and ERPs were
evaluated by the same statistical models described in the older adults'
perspective. However, the factor Age (older adults vs. young adults vs.
children) was treated as an additional between-subject factor. Post-hoc
Tukey tests were used to determine the origin of significant main effects
or interactions.

3. Results
3.1. Older adults' perspective: Behavioral data
3.1.1. Matching and semantic tasks
ERRs and RTs of the matching and semantic tasks were analyzed by
means of 2 x 2 ANOVAs (2 Groups x 2 Conditions; see Table 1 and
Fig. 2, "older adults"). Analyses of ERRs showed that in the matching
task participants made fewer errors to match than to mismatch words
(main effect of Condition: F(1,24) = 46.02, p < .001). Analyses of RTs
revealed overall faster responses to match or to related words compared
to mismatch or unrelated words (main effects of Condition: matching
task: F(1,24) = 13.97, p = .001; semantic task: F(1,24) = 52.60,
p = .001).

2.9. Statistical analyses: Older adults' perspective
Behavioral and electrophysiological data were evaluated using
analyses of variance (ANOVAs, Statistica software version 12.0, StatSoft
Inc., Tulsa). The evaluation of error rates (ERRs) and reaction times
(RTs) always included Group (MUS vs. NM) as between-subject factor
and Condition (match vs. mismatch in the matching task; related vs.
unrelated in the semantic task) as within-subject factor. Separate
ANOVAs were computed for evaluating ERRs and RTs in the matching
and semantic tasks. Furthermore, we evaluated mean amplitudes (i.e.,
based on previous literature and visual inspection of the data) of the
N200 and N400 components during the learning phase (N200:
250-350 ms, N400: 350-550 ms), the matching task and the semantic
task (N200: 250-350 ms, N400: 350-450 ms) using separate ANOVA
models for the different EEG components and tasks. The ANOVAs

tasks are shown for MUS (red) and NM (black).

3.3. Lifespan perspective: Behavioral data

3.2.1. Learning phase
In the learning phase, the N400 was larger over frontal and central
compared to parietal scalp sites (Tukey, both p < .001; main effect of
Anterior/Posterior: F(2,48) = 21.99, p < .001). In addition, both the
N400 and N200 components were larger in Block 4 than in Block 1
(Tukey, N400: p = .05, N200: p = .04; main effects of Block: N400:
F(3,72) = 3.04, p = .03, N200: F(3,72) = 3.95, p = .01; see Fig. 3A).
However, the N400 increase was only significant in MUS, with larger
N400 in Block 2 compared to Block 1 (Tukey, p = .03; main effects of
Block in separate ANOVAs for Groups: MUS: F(3,36) = 3.06, p = .04,
NM: F(3,36) = 1.14, p = .35; Group x Block x Anterior/Posterior interaction: F(6,144) = 2.32, p = .04). Since within group post-hoc analyses did not reveal significant Block x Anterior/Posterior interactions,
it results unclear how the factor Anterior/Posterior contributed to the
Group x Block x Anterior/Posterior interaction.

ERRs and RTs of the matching and semantic tasks were analyzed by
means of 2 x 3 x 2 ANOVAs (2 Groups x 3 Ages x 2 Conditions; see
Table 1 for ERRs and RT values).
3.3.1. Matching task
In the matching task, MUS made overall fewer errors than NM, and
participants generally made fewer errors to match than to mismatch
words (main effects of Group and Condition: F(1,69) = 10.88, p = .002
and F(1,69) = 69.59, p < .001, respectively; see Fig. 4). Specifically,
MUS made fewer errors than NM in response to mismatch words
(Tukey, mismatch: p < .001, match: p = .66; Group x Condition interaction: F(1,69) = 6.74, p = .01). Young adults also made fewer errors
than children (Tukey, p = .03; main effect of Age: F(2,69) = 3.81,
p = .03). Specifically, young adults made fewer errors than older adults
and children to mismatch words (Tukey, mismatch: p = .06 and
p = .002, respectively, match: both p = .99; Age x Condition interaction: F(2,69) = 5.27, p = .007). RTs were faster to match compared to
mismatch words (main effect of Condition: F(1,69) = 54.84, p < .001;
see Fig. 4). RTs were also faster in older and young adults compared to
children (Tukey, p = .02 and p < .001, respectively; main effect of
Age: F(2,69) = 10.67, p < .001). Finally, older adults responded faster
than children to mismatch words (Tukey, p = .02) and young adults
responded faster than children to both match and mismatch words
(Tukey, p = .01 and p < .001, respectively; Age x Condition:
F(2,69) = 8.20, p < .001).

3.2.2. Matching and semantic tasks
In the matching task, the N400 and N200 were larger to mismatch
than to match words over parietal sites (Tukey, both p < .001;
Condition x Anterior/Posterior interactions: N400: F(2,48) = 10.65,
p < .001, N200: F(2,48) = 16.95, p < .001, see Fig. 3B).
In the semantic task the N400 was smaller in MUS compared to NM
(main effect of Group: F(1,24) = 4.01, p = .05, see Fig. 3B). Moreover, in
MUS the N200 was larger in response to unrelated than to related words
(main effects of Condition in separate ANOVAs for Groups: MUS:
F(1,12) = 6.72, p = .02, NM: F(1,12) = 3.76, p = .08; Group x Condition
interaction: F(1,24) = 7.92, p = .01).

3.4.2. Matching and semantic tasks
In the matching task, the N400 and N200 were larger to mismatch
than to match words over parietal sites (Tukey, both p < .001;
Condition x Anterior/Posterior interactions: N400: F(2,146) = 9.23,
p < .001 and N200: F(2,146) = 28.03, p < .001). Furthermore, the
N400 was larger in older adults and children than in young adults
(Tukey, p = .05 and p < .001, respectively; main effect of Age:
F(2,73) = 9.03, p < .001). In MUS, also the N200 was larger in older
adults and children than in young adults (MUS: Tukey, p = .006 and
p = .002, respectively; main effects of Age in separate ANOVAs for
Groups: MUS: F(2,37) = 8.73, p < .001; NM: F(2,36) = 0.15, p = .86;
Group x Age: F(2,73) = 3.28, p = .04; see Fig. 6).
In the semantic task, only MUS demonstrated larger N400 responses
to unrelated compared to related words over parietal electrodes (Tukey,
p < .001; Condition x Anterior/Posterior interactions in separate
ANOVAs for Groups: MUS: F(2,74) = 8.61, p < .001; NM:
F(2,72) = 2.74, p = .08; Group x Age x Condition x Anterior/Posterior
interaction: F(4,146) = 2.42, p = .05; see Fig. 6). This effect was reversed
in young adult NM, with larger N400 to related than to unrelated words
over frontal sites (Tukey, p = .004; Condition x Anterior/Posterior
interaction: F(2,28) = 10.19, p < .001; Age x Condition x Anterior/
Posterior interaction, F(4,74) = 2.57, p = .04). Similarly, only for MUS
the N200 was larger to unrelated than to related words (main effects of
Condition in separate ANOVAs for Groups: MUS: F(1,39) = 10.63,
p = .002;
NM:
F(1,38) = 1.74,
p = .20;
Group x Condition:
F(1,73) = 9.43, p = .003, see Fig. 6). Both the N400 and N200 were
largest in children, intermediate in young adults, and smallest in older
adults (Tukey, all p < .05; main effects of Age: N400: F(2,73) = 36.04,
p < .001; N200: F(2,73) = 34.55, p < .001), with largest differences
over frontal sites (Tukey, N400: p = .01, N200: p = .03; Age x Anterior/Posterior interactions: N400: F(4,146) = 5.70, p < .001; N200:
F(4,146) = 6.60, p < .001). Only for MUS the N400 over frontal sites
was smaller in older adults compared to young adults (Tukey, MUS:
p = .05, NM: p = .53; main effects of Age of separate ANOVAs for
Groups: MUS: F(2,37) = 21.56, p < .001; NM: F(2,36) = 15.10,
p < .001; Group x Age x Condition x Anterior/Posterior interaction:
F(4,146) = 2.42, p = .05).

3.3.2. Semantic task
In the semantic task, MUS made overall fewer errors than NM (main
effect of Group: F(1,69) = 11.32, p = .001), and older adults committed
more errors than young adults (Tukey, p = .04; main effect of Age:
F(2,69) = 3.35, p = .04). Furthermore, young adults made more errors
to related compared to unrelated words (main effects of Condition of
separate ANOVAs for Ages: young adults: F(1,24) = 12.48, p = .002;
older adults: F(1,24) = 1.28, p = .27; children: F(1,21) = 0.39, p = .54;
Age x Condition: F(2,69) = 3.98, p = .02; see Fig. 4). Regarding RTs,
participants responded faster to related than to unrelated words (main
effect of Condition: F(1,69) = 148.99, p < .001; see Fig. 4), and older
and young adults responded faster than children (Tukey, both
p < .001; main effect of Age: F(2,69) = 49.68, p < .001).

4. Discussion

3.4. Lifespan perspective: Electrophysiological data

In a natural context, word learning constitutes a multifaceted perceptual and cognitive task requiring phonological encoding, speech
segmentation and meaning acquisition (Rodriguez-Fornells et al.,
2009). In the present EEG study, we adapted word learning to a laboratory setting and applied a set of concatenated tasks that put particular emphasis on different cognitive functions. In the learning phase,
participants had to properly encode foreign language speech sounds
and to learn associations between pictures and words, whereas in the
successive matching task participants had to recall the previously
learned associations from memory. Finally, during the semantic task
participants were required to access lexical-semantic representations.
Within this framework, we focused on two parallel topics, namely on
(1) whether the beneficial effect of musical expertise on word learning
is preserved in older participants, and (2) on the developmental trajectory of word learning across the lifespan and its interaction with
musical expertise. In turn, we will separately discuss the results of the
older adults' and lifespan perspectives.

The electrophysiological data were analyzed by means of
2 x 3 x 4 x 3 (2 Groups x 3 Ages x 4 Blocks x 3 Anterior/Posterior;
learning phase) and 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 (2 Groups x 3 Ages x 2
Conditions x 3 Anterior/Posterior; matching and semantic tasks)
ANOVAs (see Table 3 for V values and standard deviations).
3.4.1. Learning phase
In the learning phase, only in MUS N400 and N200 responses were
larger in Block 2 compared to Block 1 (main effects of Block: MUS:
N400: F(1,37) = 26.81, p < .001; N200: F(1,37) = 21.61, p < .001; and
NM: N400: F(1,36) = 2.51, p = .12; N200: F(1,36) = 1.48, p = .23;
Group x Block interactions: N400: F(1,73) = 6.49, p = .01; N200:
F(1,73) = 6.62, p = .01, see Fig. 5). Moreover, the N200 increase was
significant in young adults (main effect of Block: F(1,29) = 14.02,
p < .001) and in children over frontal and central sites (Tukey,
p < .001 and p = .004, respectively; main effect of Block:
F(1,22) = 8.34, p = .009 and Block x Anterior/Posterior interaction:
F(2,44) = 4.10, p = .02), but not in older adults (main effect of Block:
F(1,25) = 2.37,
p = .14;
Age x Block x Anterior/Posterior:
F(4,146) = 3.23, p = .01). Finally, the N400 and N200 were largest in
children, intermediate in young adults, and smallest in older adults

4.1. Older adults' perspective: Musical expertise and novel word learning
During the learning phase, older adults demonstrated fast neural
plasticity effects that developed after only five minutes of learning
picture-word associations. These neural dynamics were manifested by

Fig. 3. Older adults: electrophysiological data. ERPs recorded (A) at the central electrode (Cz) in the learning phase and (B) at the parietal electrode (Pz) in the
matching and semantic tasks are shown for (A) the different blocks and (B) conditions, separately for all participants (ALL), musicians (MUS), and non-musicians
(NM). Voltage values are scaled from (A) -2.5 to +1.0 V and (B) -1.5 to +1.5 V. In this and subsequent figures, time in milliseconds is reported in the abscissa
and the amplitude of the effects in microvolt is depicted in the ordinate. Time zero corresponds to word onset and negativity is plotted upwards. The level of
significance is represented by stars with * p < .05, ** p < .01, ***p < .001, and n.s. = not significant. Topographic voltage distribution maps of the differences
between (A) the first two blocks (Block 2 minus 1) and (B) the two conditions (mismatch minus match, and unrelated minus related, respectively) are illustrated for
the N200 and N400 components.

components were most pronounced at parietal scalp sites (see Fig. 3B,
"ALL"). The N200 and N400 effects are interpreted as indicating a
phonological and lexical-semantic mismatch between the expected
words corresponding to the pictures and the actually presented words.
Furthermore, posterior N200 and N400 distributions are typically observed during linguistic tasks requiring access to lexical-semantic
knowledge (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). Since the topographical distributions of these processes clearly differed from the frontal N400
waveforms observed during the learning phase, results clearly indicate
the engagement of differential mnemonic functions during the learning
phase and the matching task.
In the semantic task, the older participants had to translate the
meaning of the newly learned words to semantically affine pictures that
have not been presented before in the course of the experiment.
Surprisingly, during this task we did not find clear behavioral and
electrophysiological evidence for the integration of the newly learned
words into lexical-semantic memory. In fact, both N400 responses and
ERRs were not differentially sensitive to related and unrelated words

significantly increased N200 and N400 amplitudes taken to reflect
phonological processes and verbal memory functions from Block 1 to
Block 4 (see Fig. 3A, "ALL"). Moreover, in line with previous literature
on word learning (Batterink & Neville, 2011; Borovsky, Elman, & Kutas,
2012; Borovsky, Kutas, & Elman, 2010; Dittinger et al., 2016;
McLaughlin et al., 2004; Mestres-Misse, Rodriguez-Fornells, & Munte,
2007; Perfetti et al., 2005), N400 responses to novel words were larger
at frontal-central electrodes compared to parietal scalp sites. Such
anterior N400 manifestations are in line with previous work showing
the contribution of frontal brain regions to the acquisition of word
meaning (Rodriguez-Fornells et al., 2009) and to the maintenance of
novel information in working memory (Hagoort, 2014).
The behavioral data of the matching task confirmed that older
adults were able to learn novel words. In fact, the participants generally
showed lower ERRs and faster RTs to match compared to mismatch
words (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, older adults demonstrated significantly
increased N200 and N400 amplitudes in response to mismatch compared to match words (i.e., N200 and N400 effects), and both

(see Fig. 3B, "ALL"), even though RTs were generally faster in response
to related words (see Fig. 2). Accordingly, results indicate that the
meaning of the learned words was not sufficiently integrated into lexical-semantic memory in order to generalize to semantically affine new
pictures.
The evaluation of the influence of musical expertise during the
learning phase revealed that only older adult MUS demonstrated a
rapid increase of the N400 waveform from Block 1 to Block 2. This
result is in line with previous studies of our group (Dittinger et al.,
2016; Dittinger, Chobert, et al., 2017) indicating faster N400 dynamics
and superior word encoding abilities in MUS compared to NM. However, according to visual data inspection (see Fig. 3A), in Block 1 the
N400 was larger in older adult NM compared to MUS, whereas in Block
4N400 amplitudes were almost comparable between the two groups.
Therefore, it appears conceivable that older adult NM more strongly
engaged verbal memory functions at the beginning of the experiment
(Block 1) without further modulation of the N400 component in the
subsequent blocks (i.e., increased or decreased amplitudes). By contrast, the increased N400 magnitudes we revealed across the blocks in
older adult MUS during the learning phase might possibly reflect a
more gradual recruitment of processing resources. Such group differences in the developmental dynamics of the N400 waveform as well as
the observed convergence of N400 responses between the two groups at
the end of the learning phase, might contribute to explain why older
adult MUS and NM performed the matching and semantic tasks in a
similar manner (see Fig. 2). In this context, it is important to mention
that the absence of behavioral between-group differences in the
matching task is in line with the results previously reported in young
adults (Dittinger et al., 2016), whereas the comparable performance of

the two groups in the semantic task was rather unexpected. Nevertheless, the lack of between-group differences in ERRs and RTs during
the semantic task is interpreted as indicating that the cognitive advantages previously reported in MUS by other authors (George & Coch,
2011; Moreno et al., 2011; Schellenberg, 2004; Strait et al., 2015; Zuk
et al., 2014) were counteracted by aging. In particular, since the semantic task placed additional demands on working memory functions
that were required to compare the degree of semantic affinity between
the new and old pictures, we speculate that the beneficial effect of
musical expertise might be less pronounced in tasks that place particular emphasis on working memory capacity. Such a perspective is
compatible with previous work showing that older adults have more
difficulties than younger adults in working memory tasks, and generally
exhibit activation patterns reflecting signs of inefficiency in brain regions supporting executive functions (Allen, Lien, Ruthruff, & Voss,
2014; Nashiro, Qin, O'Connell, & Basak, 2018). Finally, it is noteworthy
to mention that currently it is an open question whether experience and
expertise in different domains might decelerate cognitive decline
during aging. In fact, most of the studies on this topic used cross-sectional or retrospective approaches that do not enable to infer causality.
Furthermore, the available data do not convincingly support the view of
a strong experiential moderation of age-related effects in cognitive
performance (Ericsson, 2006; Salthouse, 1990).
Although the electrophysiological results of the semantic task were
in contrast to the behavioral data, they nevertheless brought to light
two interesting effects of musical expertise that were manifested in the
N200 and N400 time windows. The first result that deserves to be
mentioned is that older adult MUS demonstrated significantly larger
N200 amplitudes in response to unrelated compared to related words.

in MUS from Block 1 to Block 2 during the learning phase as well as the
comparable N400 amplitudes elicited in the two groups in the matching
task, it is more likely to assume that NM more strongly recruited additional top-down resources (i.e., attention, short-term memory, or
working memory) for managing the semantic task. However, in order to
better elucidate this argumentation, further studies should more
strongly focus on associations between N400 dynamics and a variety of
cognitive functions.
In summary, the results of the older adults' perspective clearly demonstrated that the participants were generally able to rapidly encode
picture-word associations and to learn novel words. However, the absence of semantic priming effects in terms of ERRs and N400 responses
during the semantic task converge to the notion that older adults were
not able to sufficiently integrate the meaning of the novel words into
semantic memory. Moreover, in contrast to our hypothesis, in older
adults novel word learning was apparently not markedly influenced by
musical expertise. In order to shed further light on the relationships
between musical expertise, word learning and aging, future studies
should use more word repetitions that might facilitate consolidation
processes.

Albeit the fact that the N200 component is susceptible to various factors, like for example attention (Patel & Azzam, 2005) and cognitive
control mechanisms (Kropotov, Ponomarev, Pronina, & Jancke, 2017;
Kropotov, Ponomarev, Tereshchenko, Muller, & Jancke, 2016), this
component has previously been described as a robust marker of phonological processing and categorization (Connolly & Phillips, 1994;
Friedrich & Friederici, 2008). Accordingly, the reduced N200 amplitudes we observed in MUS in response to related compared to unrelated
words are thought to reflect phonological priming mechanisms that
originated from a pre-activation of the target words and their respective
phonological properties in short-term memory while seeing the pictures
(i.e., always presented first). Otherwise, it should be mentioned that the
N200 component has also been shown to be influenced by contextual
effects during word recognition and to be susceptible to semantic
priming effects (van den Brink et al., 2001). However, since the N200
effect was not accompanied by a clear N400 effect, this alternative
interpretation is highly questionable.
The second main effect of musical expertise we revealed during the
semantic task emerged in the N400 latency window, started at around
350 ms post-stimulus onset, and originated from a larger positive shift
(i.e., less negativity) in older adult MUS compared to NM (see Fig. 3B).
Since this consistent positive shift was not differentially modulated by
the semantic relatedness of the words, it is inconceivable to assume that
the N400 component reflected semantic priming effects that were
driven by the pre-activation of the words in verbal memory (Polich,
2007). Considering the higher degree of N400 modulations we revealed

4.2. Lifespan perspective: The effect of age
Speech and language processing undergo several qualitative and
quantitative changes in the developmental trajectory (Shafto & Tyler,
2014). For example, aging is accompanied by an expansion of

blocks, separately for MUS and NM, as well as for older adults (left), young adults (middle) and children (right). Topographic voltage distribution maps of the

children and young adults may indicate a higher degree of neural
plasticity related to phonological processing in these two cohorts
compared to older adults, whereas the decrease of N200 and N400
amplitudes across the lifespan may specify that development and aging
generally facilitate phonological, lexical and semantic processing
(Gunter, Jackson, & Mulder, 1992; Holcomb, Coffey, & Neville, 1992;
Juottonen, Revonsuo, & Lang, 1996; Kutas & Iragui, 1998; Lee &
Federmeier, 2009). However, according to the behavioral data showing
the highest learning rate in young adults compared to children and
older adults, increased amplitudes in children and decreased ones in
older adults might reflect signs of inefficiency. In this context, we
speculate that unripe prefrontal functions in children (Gogtay et al.,
2004) may lead to a stronger recruitment of neural resources needed for
solving the task. By contrast, grey matter tissue loss as a function of
aging might result in the recruitment of less neural entities that is
manifested in lower ERP amplitudes.
During the matching task, the N400 component was differentially
influenced by age. In line with our hypothesis, both children and older
adults were characterized by increased amplitudes compared to young
adults (i.e., inverse U-shaped relationship). These results may indicate
that children and older adults invested more neural resources than
young adults for accomplishing the task (i.e., neural compensation).
However, in children such a "working harder" processing mode was not
that efficient as in older adults. In fact, children demonstrated longer
RTs compared to older adults and committed more errors than young
adults. Furthermore, it is interesting to denote that older adults were
closer to children in terms of ERRs and more similar to young adults

vocabulary, a differential recruitment of lexical-semantic networks and
a shift from controlled to automatic processing (Shafto & Tyler, 2014).
Such a developmental perspective was clearly reflected by the behavioral data (i.e., ERRs and RTs) of the matching and semantic tasks. In
fact, during the matching task young adults demonstrated lower ERRs
compared to older adults and children, and both older and young adults
responded faster than children. Interestingly, behavioral differences
between the age cohorts mainly originated from mismatch trials, indicating that children and older adults were more prone than young
adults to consider words that did not match with the pictures as
matching trials. Based on the fact that mismatch trials were more difficult than match trials (i.e., as reflected by overall higher ERRs and
slower RTs to mismatch compared to match words), results suggest that
age-related differences are particularly pronounced in difficult compared to simple task conditions. Finally, in the semantic task older
adults committed more errors than young adults, and both older and
young adults responded faster than children. These results are interpreted as reflecting different maturational trajectories of cognitive
functions and neural ripening across the lifespan (Giorgio et al., 2010;
Gogtay et al., 2004).
The analysis of the electrophysiological data showed that during the
learning phase children and young adults were characterized by increased of N200 amplitudes from Block 1 to Block 2, and that children
demonstrated the largest difference between these two blocks at anterior and central electrodes. Furthermore, both N200 and N400 amplitudes were smallest in older adults, intermediate in young adults, and
largest in children. The fast development of the N200 component in

training (Dittinger et al., 2016; Elmer, Albrecht, Valizadeh, Francois, &
Rodriguez-Fornells, 2018; Elmer, Greber, Pushparaj, Kuhnis, & Jancke,
2017). Notably, this increased neural efficiency also translated to a
behavioral advantage of MUS across the three age-groups in both the
matching and semantic tasks, indicating a positive influence of music
practice on the formation of novel associations in episodic memory and
the integration of novel words into semantic memory. However, within
the sample of older adults these effects did not reach significance (i.e.,
no significant differences between MUS and NM at the behavioral
level).
Notably, during the matching task only within the MUS group
children and older adults demonstrated increased N200 amplitudes
compared to young adults. Since this effect was not observed within the
group of NM, and children and older adults are generally characterized
by more susceptible cognitive functioning compared to young adults
(Dempster, 1992; Luna et al., 2001), results are interpreted as indicating a compensatory influence of musical expertise. In this vein,
previous work reported a positive influence of music training on attention functions (Kraus & Chandrasekaran, 2010) and phonetic processing (Chobert et al., 2014; Elmer et al., 2012; Kuhnis et al., 2013)
that was mirrored by modulations of the N200 component. Previous
studies also carved out that children and older adults often demonstrate
dysfunctional phonological processing (Carroll, Snowling, Hulme, &
Stevenson, 2003; Froehlich et al., 2018) and executive functions (Brocki
& Bohlin, 2004; Kennedy & Raz, 2009). Consequently, children and

regarding RTs.
Finally, during the semantic task both the N200 and N400 components were largest in children, intermediate in young adults, and
smallest in older adults. Such a decrease of N200 and N400 amplitudes
as a function of aging might reflect neural and cognitive facilitation in
accessing phonological and lexical-semantic information. However, this
perspective is, at least partially, in contrast with the behavioral and
physiological data showing that older adults committed more errors
than young adults and were not characterized by a clear N400 effect. In
order to better elucidate the complex relationships between ERPs and
cognitive functions, future studies should use more sophisticated psychological screening procedures targeting at better capturing attention,
short-term-, working-, episodic- and semantic memory, and try to correlate these measures with behavioral and electrophysiological indices.

4.3. Lifespan perspective: The effect of musicianship
An additional purpose of this work was to uncover putative interactions between musical expertise, age cohorts and word learning. The
analyses of the N200 and N400 components during the learning phase
revealed that only MUS (i.e., averaged across age cohorts) demonstrated increased amplitudes in the second- compared to the first block.
Such short-term brain changes in MUS have previously been described
by other groups (Seppanen et al., 2013) and posit a high degree of
neural efficiency for learning speech sounds as a function of music

young adults, with less clear-cut influences of musical expertise in older
adults. Taken together, these results document qualitative and quantitative differences in the ability to learn new words across the lifespan.

older adults might have particularly benefited from musical expertise
that possibly acted as a vehicle for compensating suboptimal auditory
and cognitive functions.
During the semantic task, MUS performed better than NM, and this
behavioral advantage was accompanied by a multifaceted constellation
of neural responses. First of all, only MUS showed N200 and N400 effects that originated from increased brain responses to unrelated compared to related trials. Since N200 and N400 effects with a characteristic topographical distribution over posterior electrodes are classically
considered to be sensitive markers for the integration of information
into lexical-semantic memory (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Patel &
Azzam, 2005), results are interpreted as suggesting that musical expertise has a beneficial influence on mapping the meaning of lexically
affine items. Our analyses also uncovered smaller N400 amplitudes in
older adult MUS compared to young adult MUS over frontal electrodes,
possibly indicating a higher degree of neural inefficiency in older adult
MUS compared to young adult MUS.

7. Statement of significance
Word learning is overall preserved in older participants, however,
without clear evidence for a beneficial influence of music training.
Otherwise, music training during childhood and early adulthood
showed a beneficial effect on word learning. Results indicate that music
training boosts word learning but does not necessarily counteract aging
effects.

5. Limitations
We would like to thank all the participants for having contributed to
the experiment. ED's work was supported by the Labex BLRI (ANR-11LABX-0036), managed by the French National Agency for Research
(ANR) under the program "Investissements d'Avenir" (ANR-11-IDEX0001-02). SE and LJ were supported by the Swiss National Science
Foundation (grant SNF320030B_138668 to LJ). The authors declare no
competing financial interests.

A limitation of this study is that two cohorts (i.e., children and
young adults) were measured in Marseille (France), whereas the older
adult sample was measured in Zurich (Switzerland). In this context, it is
important to mention that the aspirated phoneme of the Thai word
/pha/ is part of the German phonetic repertoire but constitutes a nonnative phoneme for French speakers. Consequently, we cannot exclude
that this specific stimulus might have influenced the results. A second
limitation of our study is that the stimuli we used were recorded by a
female Thai-French bilingual speaker, this possibly making the stimuli
easier to perceive for French than Swiss German participants. Finally, it
should be mentioned that the participants of the older adults' perspective were relatively young (i.e., mean age = 60.6 years) in comparison to other studies. Accordingly, our results only reflect this specific age cohort and not necessarily older participants in general.

6. Conclusions
In the present EEG study, we used a cross-sectional approach in
three cohorts of participants in order to evaluate (1) whether musical
expertise might have a neuroprotective influence on word learning in
older adults, (2) whether the ability to learn new words through picture-word associations changes throughout lifespan, and (3) whether
musical expertise interacts with word learning and aging. The comparison between older MUS and NM (i.e., research question 1) did not
reveal clear evidence for a relationship between musical expertise and
word learning, leading to suggest that aging mitigates the beneficial
effects of musical expertise. The evaluation of the data of the lifespan
perspective (i.e. research question 2) revealed that all participants were
generally able to learn novel words very fast. Furthermore, we observed
an inverted U-shaped relationship between age and word learning that
was mirrored by lower ERRs and faster RTs in young adults compared
to children and older adults. This result is particularly interesting in
that it documents a differential developmental trajectory of word
learning across lifespan. These behavioral results were accompanied by
decreased N200 and N400 amplitudes across the lifespan during both
the learning phase and the semantic tasks, possibly indicating that
development and aging differentially affect cognitive functions during
word encoding and lexical-semantic integration. Finally, the evaluation
of the influence of musical expertise on word learning across the lifespan (i.e., research question 3) showed that musical expertise generally
facilitated the formation of new episodic memory traces for novel
words. However, according to post-hoc analyses, this effect was not
present within the older adults group. In addition, musical expertise
was clearly associated with an amelioration of integration of novel
words into lexical-semantic networks. Also here, the beneficial effect of
musical expertise on word learning was restricted to children and
