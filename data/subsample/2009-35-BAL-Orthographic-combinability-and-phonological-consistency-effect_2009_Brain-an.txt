In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to trace the temporal dynamics of phonological
consistency and phonetic combinability in the reading of Chinese phonograms. The data showed a significant consistency-by-combinability interaction at N170. High phonetic combinability characters elicited
greater negativity at N170 than did low phonetic combinability characters, and the combinability effect
was only found in the reading of high consistency characters. The results support the phonological mapping hypothesis of the reading-related N170 effect and suggest that the earlier stages of visual word recognition are shaped by the mapping of orthography to phonology even in Chinese. Moreover, our data
revealed both consistency and combinability effects at P200 and N400, accounted for by the two-stage
framework for visual word recognition. That is, characters with high combinability or high consistency
facilitated the earlier stages of orthographic or phonological processing which were due to increased activation at the perceptual level; consequently, less positive P200 was demonstrated. In the later stages,
high combinability or high consistency characters were associated with a larger semantic neighborhood,
which increased semantic competition and exaggerated the N400 effect. These data support the assumption of radical-based inputs proposed by the lexical constituent model. However, the phonetic consistency effects found at N170 and P200 cannot be reconciled with the current framework of the lexical
constituent model. A possible revision will be discussed.

1. Introduction
How words are represented in the mental lexicon and how lexical knowledge can be retrieved are central issues in the study of
human language processing. In the past few years, research has
demonstrated that a word's identification is affected by its neighboring structure. The well-established neighborhood properties
of a word include the orthography-to-phonology consistency (i.e.,
the degree to which similarly spelled words are pronounced similarly) (Taraban & McClelland, 1987), the orthographic neighborhood size (i.e., the number of words that can be created by
changing a single letter in a target word) (Andrews, 1989;
Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, & Besner, 1977; Grainger, O'Regan,
Jacobs, & Segui, 1989; Holcomb, Grainger, & O' Rourke, 2002),
and the phonological neighborhood density (i.e., the number of
words that can be derived by changing one phoneme in a target
word) (Pylkkanen, Stringfellow, & Marantz, 2002). These types of

studies are valuable since they provide insight into the organization of lexical knowledge and the processes underlying word
recognition. The current study aims to advance our knowledge of
the role of the orthographic neighborhood size (the phonetic radical combinability) in the reading of Chinese characters.
1.1. Orthographic neighborhood size effect in alphabetic writing
system
In studies of English, the orthographic neighborhood size of a
word is defined as the number of words that can be created by
changing a single letter of the word while maintaining the original
positions of the letters (Coltheart et al., 1977). For example, the
word cheat has four neighbors (i.e. cheap, chest, cleat, and wheat)
and the word cover has thirteen (a partial list includes coven, covet,
cower, hover, lover, and mover). Most of the studies in this field use
the lexical decision task and report a facilitative neighborhood size
effect for low frequency words and its interaction with word frequency (Andrews, 1989; Forster & Shen, 1996; Pollatsek, Perea, &
Binder, 1999). Specifically, the response latencies to low- frequency words with many neighbors are shorter than those with
few neighbors; however, the neighborhood size effect is negligible

C.-H. Hsu et al. / Brain & Language 108 (2009) 56-66

or nonexistent for high- frequency words. However, inhibitory
neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency effects for lowfrequency words have also been reported in studies using various
tasks such as the perceptual identification task, progressive
demasking paradigm, sentence reading task, and lexical decision
task (Grainger & Segui, 1990; Perea, Carreiras, & Grainger, 2004;
Pollatsek et al., 1999; Snodgrass & Mintzer, 1993).
Grainger and Jacobs (1996) proposed the multiple read-out
model (MROM) to simulate a wide variety of neighborhood effects in different tasks on the basis of three output criteria/processes that underlie the speeded binary lexical decision task.
Two of the processes use intralexical information to generate a
``yes" response, while the third process uses extralexical information to generate a ``no" response in the lexical decision task.
The two intralexical sources are (a) local lexical activation of
the target word itself and (b) global activity in the mental lexicon induced by a partial activation of the target word's orthographic neighbors. The extralexical source of information is the
time criterion. The criterion value set on each of the three information dimensions determines the type (``yes" or ``no") and
speed of a lexical decision response. When either global or local
activation exceeds a criterion, either a word response or ``yes"
response is made. Hence, the facilitative neighborhood size effect
can be explained as follows: when a word has a larger neighborhood size, there is more global activation in the mental lexicon
and a faster positive response can be generated. In addition,
the MROM introduces a ``fast guess" mechanism that can lead
to a ``yes" response when the total activation in the lexicon exceeds the criterion, even before any specific word representation
has reached the threshold criterion. Further, it explains that a
lexical decision can be made even before lexical identification
is fully complete, especially when the task stresses speed over
accuracy. On the other hand, the inhibitory neighborhood size
or neighborhood frequency effect reflects the lateral inhibition
between the intralexical word units (orthographic neighbors),
especially when the task stresses on accuracy or requires deep
processes such as accessing a word's meaning. The MROM also
implies how lexical activity unfolds over time. For example, a
decision made in the earlier stage of processing is mainly determined by the global activation while the local activation plays a
much more important role in the later stage of the lexical
competition.
To assess the assumption of the MROM, Holcomb, Grainger, and
O' Rourke (2002) conducted a lexical decision task in which they
manipulated the orthographic neighborhood size of English words
and pseudowords. Although their results showed opposing effects
of neighborhood size for words and pseudowords in terms of the
participants' reaction times, both the words and pseudowords produced a consistent pattern of neighborhood size effect at N400.
That is, when the neighborhood size was large, both the words
and pseudowords induced greater negative amplitude of N400
than when the neighborhood size was small. They interpreted
the data as supporting the MROM and suggested that N400 reflects
the global lexical activity induced by both the words and pseudowords. However, other studies found frequency and congruency effects at the syllable level at the frontal P200, whereas these effects
at the lexical level were observed at the later N400 (Barber,
Vergara, & Carreiras, 2004; Carreiras, Vergara, & Barber, 2005).
These findings suggest that P200 reflects the lexical activity triggered by sublexical units, while N400 reflects the lateral inhibition
process for suppressing the activity of other items, with the inhibition being stronger for words with larger neighborhoods. It
remains unclear whether P200 and N400 reflect the two distinctive
mechanisms of MROM, i.e., the global lexical activity in the early
phase of processing and the lexical competition of the lateral
inhibitory process.

1.2. Orthographic neighborhood size effect in the reading of chinese
characters
In Chinese, approximately 80% of the characters are phonograms that consist of a semantic radical (usually on the left-hand
side) and a phonetic radical (usually on the right-hand side). There
is increasing evidence that indicates that reading a complex character involves the processing of its radicals (Chen & Weekes, 2004;
Ding, Peng, & Taft, 2004; Feldman & Siok, 1997; Feldman & Siok,
1999; Lee, Tsai, Chiu, Tzeng, & Hung, 2006; Taft & Zhu, 1997).
The orthographic neighborhood size effect in the reading of
Chinese characters was first addressed by Taft and Zhu (1997).
They defined radical frequency as the number of characters that
share the same radical, regardless of the radical position or radical
function. Their data showed a position sensitive effect of radical
frequency, i.e., the lexical decision time for characters with high
radical frequency was faster than that for characters with low
radical frequency. Furthermore, this was true only for the radicals
that appeared on the right-hand side of the character.
However, in most Chinese phonograms, the phonetic radical
tends to appear on the right and the semantic radical tends to appear
on the left. In Taft's study, the radical position might have been confused with the radical function. To avoid this confusion, Feldman and
Siok (1997) used the term radical combinability (defined by function)
rather than radical frequency (defined by form). In addition, combinability can be further divided into phonetic combinability and
semantic combinability, which are defined as the number of phonograms that share the same phonetic or semantic radical, respectively. By manipulating the radical combinability (for the phonetic
and semantic radicals) and radical position in a character decision
task, they found facilitative combinability effects for both semantic
and phonetic radicals; however, these effects were not reliable within their positions. For the phonetic radicals, the combinability effect
was significant in both the left and right positions. On the other hand,
for the semantic radicals, the combinability effect was significant
only when the semantic radical was on the left. These findings suggest that the radical function should be considered when investigating the radical combinability effect (Feldman & Siok, 1997). This
conclusion has been further supported by Chen and Weekes's study
(2004) which demonstrated that the combinability effect of the
semantic radical can be reversed in semantic category judgment
while reading semantic transparent and semantic opaque characters. However, the question of how the function of a phonetic radical
affects the orthographic combinability effect remains unanswered
in this field.
Perfetti, Liu, and Tan (2005) proposed an interactive constituency model that assumes that the representation of a word consists
of
three
interlocking
constituents:
orthographic,
phonological, and semantic. The input units are radicals and the
spatial relationship between the radicals. The radical input and
the phonological levels of the model can be regarded as distributed
representations, whereas the orthographic and semantic representations can be regarded as localized representations. According to
this framework, successful lexical retrieval (word identification)
requires full specification of all the three constituents. Furthermore, this model predicted the temporal dynamics of graphic
and phonological effects. That is, the radical-based inputs provide
facilitation in the early orthographic processing. Furthermore,
when a radical activates more than one character to threshold level, the inhibitory process emerges at the lexical level. These
assumptions consistent with their study on event-related potentials (ERPs) (Liu, Perfetti, & Hart, 2003) which demonstrated that
P200 was reduced when the character shared a radical with the
preceding character and interpreted it as a graphic processing
component. Meanwhile, the phonological interference effect was
found in N400, which indexes character-level competition.

58

Based on the lexical constituent model, one would predict the
reversed phonetic combinability effect in the different stages of
lexical processing. A character with larger combinability should
display larger facilitative effect on P200 and inhibitory effect on
N400 than would a character with small combinability. However,
the following question remains: how does the function of a phonetic radical take part in the Chinese lexical process? To address
this issue, it is necessary to define the validity of phonetic radicals.
In Chinese, the phonological relationship between a phonogram
and a phonetic radical can be addressed by consistency, which
indicates whether the pronunciation of a character agrees with
those of its orthographic neighbors containing the same phonetic
radical. The indices of consistency for English and Chinese are parallel in nature with respect to the representation of the statistical
relationship between orthographic forms and their pronunciations.
In studies of English, the consistency effect refers to findings suggesting that naming responses are faster and more accurate for
words that have orthographic and phonological consistency (e.g.,
-ean in the final position of a word is always pronounced /In/ as
in lean, dean, bean, etc.). In contrast, naming responses are slower
and less accurate for words lacking consistency (e.g., -int corresponds to /Int/ in mint and to /aInt/ in pint). This effect was observed primarily for words that have a low frequency of use
(Seidenberg & Waters, 1985; Seidenberg, Waters, Barnes, &
Tanenhaus, 1984; Taraban & McClelland, 1987). However, Jared
(1997, 2002) demonstrated that high frequency words can also reveal a consistency effect equivalent to that of low frequency words
when the summed frequency of friends and enemies in both the
high and low frequency words are controlled. The consistency
effect was used to support a single mechanism for converting
printed words/pseudowords into speech sounds correlating to
the statistical mapping we observed between orthography and
phonology. On the other hand, previous studies manipulated character frequency and consistency and demonstrated frequency-byconsistency interaction in the naming of Chinese phonograms
(Fang, Horng, & Tzeng, 1986; Lee, Tsai, Su, Tzeng, & Hung, 2005;
Lee et al., 2004). That is, among low frequency characters, the
characters of low consistency had a longer reaction time and lower
accuracy than did the characters of high consistency. Parallel to
Jared's (1997, 2002) findings, Lee et al. (2005) also demonstrated
that provided the summed frequency of friends and enemies was
controlled, there was a consistency effect in the reading of high frequency characters. Moreover, Tsai, Lee, Tzeng, Hung, and Yen
(2004) investigated participants' eye movements while performing
progressive sentence reading, and they found that character consistency had an impact on their fixation duration. These results
suggest that the phonological information provided by the phonetic radical played a role in the reading of Chinese phonograms.
In Chinese, consistency is defined by the ratio of the number of
characters containing the same phonetic radical with the same
pronunciation to the number of characters containing the same
phonetic radical (the so-called phonetic combinability). It implies
that in learning or developing the statistical mappings between
orthography and phonology, orthographic similarity participates
in the phonological restructuring of individual word representations. In other words, characters/words in dense neighborhoods
may experience more pressure toward restructuring than would
characters/words in sparse neighborhoods (Ziegler & Goswami,
2005). Lee et al (2007), which manipulated high or low consistency
characters while matching their phonetic combinability, found low
consistency characters to elicit more positive P200 in the frontal
region and less negative amplitude at N400 than did high consistency characters. This effect can be interpreted as an early orthographic or phonological activation (indexed by P200), associated
with a given phonetic radical at the sublexical level and late competition (indexed by N400) among those lexical candidates that

share the same phonetic radical. If the similarity-based view of
the lexical restructuring process is true, one would expect to see
that characters with high phonetic combinability will experience
more pressure toward restructuring than will those with low phonetic combinability. In other words, phonograms with high phonetic combinability should display a greater consistency effect
than will those with lower phonetic combinability. To test this
hypothesis, the present study manipulates phonological consistency and phonetic combinability simultaneously (see Fig. 1) to
examine whether the consistency effect would be modulated by
the phonetic combinability. We expect the following results: first,
the consistency effect found in Lee et al. (2007) will be replicated;
second, the consistency effect will be more salient in the reading of
high combinability characters. Lee et al. (2007) had demonstrated
that the consistency effect can be found to influence different ERP
components (such as N170, P200, and N400). Therefore, the answer to whether or not interaction between consistency and combinability can be found in different stages of the lexical process will
shed some light on the temporal dynamics of phonological and
orthographic processing in the reading of Chinese.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Participants
Thirty-five right-handed native Chinese speakers with normal
to corrected vision were paid to participate in this study. After artifact rejection, four participants (three males) were excluded from
the analysis due to the extremely small number of valid trials in
their data (less than 12). The final analysis was conducted with
31 participants (17 males) whose average age was 23. Written consent was obtained from all the participants.
2.2. Experiment design and materials
A list of 120 Chinese phonograms, configured horizontally with
a semantic radical on the left and a phonetic radical on the right,
were selected from the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus (Huang
& Chen, 1998). The corpus is based on more than 5 million words
(approximately 10 million characters) culled from textbooks,
newspapers, works of literature, popular works of fiction and nonfiction, and transcripts. These phonograms were divided into four
conditions (see Fig. 1) by manipulating their phonological consis-

tency (high vs. low) and phonetic combinability (high vs. low). The
index for phonetic combinability and consistency was calculated
based on 3697 phonograms. Phonetic combinability was defined
as the number of phonograms that share a phonetic radical; characters with the same pronunciation within a group of characters
were classified as ``friends." Phonological consistency was indexed
by the proportion of the number of friends to phonetic combinability. Table 1 illustrates the characteristics of each condition. Each
target character was paired with a homophone for the homophone
judgment task. The aim of this task was to ensure that the phonology of a target was processed without an overt naming response
that might cause muscular noise during the electroencephalogram
(EEG) recording. To ensure that the participants knew the correct
pronunciations of the target characters, each target character was
followed by a homophone as a ``yes" trial. To balance the response,
another group of 120 non-homophone pairs was created for ``no"
trials. The mean correctness of all the participants was 88% (ranging from 73% to 99%).
2.3. Procedure
The participants were seated in front of a monitor, at a distance
of approximately 60 cm, in an acoustically shielded room. Each
participant was given 20 practice trials and 240 randomized experimental trials in three test sessions. The participants were permitted to take breaks between test sessions for as long as they
required. The duration of the experiment was approximately
30 m for each participant. A trial consisted of a cross fixation for
500 ms and the display of a target character for another 500 ms.
The participants were asked to silently name the target character.
The target character was then replaced with a blank space for
1000 ms before a probe character was presented. The participants
were asked to decide whether the target character and probe character were homophones by pressing a button on the mouse as
quickly and accurately as possible. The index finger indicated ``yes"
and the middle finger ``no." The correctness of the responses and
reaction times were recorded. After the disappearance of the probe
character, the capital letter ``B" was presented in boldface for
1600 ms as a signal for the participants to blink quickly, if necessary, before the next trial.
2.4. EEG recording and preprocessing
The EEG was recorded from 64 Ag/AgCl electrodes (QuickCap,
Neuromedical Supplies, Sterling, USA) with a common vertex
reference located between Cz and CPz. The data were re-referenced
off-line to the average of the right and left mastoids for further
analysis. Vertical eye movements (VEOG) were recorded by a pair
of electrodes placed on the supra- and infraorbital ridges of the left
eye. Horizontal eye movements (HEOG) were recorded by a pair of
electrodes placed lateral to the outer canthus of the right and left
eyes. A ground electrode was placed on the forehead anterior to
Fz. Electrode impedance was kept below 5 KX. The EEG signal

was continuously recorded and digitized at a rate of 500 Hz. The
signals were amplified with SynAmps2 O (Neuroscan, Inc.)
amplifiers at a band-pass filter of 0.05-100 Hz for off-line analysis.
For the off-line analysis, the continuous wave was low-pass filtered below 50 Hz (zero phase shift mode, 12 dB) and then epoched with 100-ms pre-stimulus intervals and 922-ms poststimulus intervals. The pre-stimulus interval ( 100 ms-0 ms)
was used for baseline correction. Trials contaminated by eye movement or with voltage variations larger than 60 lV were rejected.
Next, the data were low-pass filtered below 30 Hz (zero phase shift
mode, 12 dB). The ERPs of the four conditions were computed for
every participant at every electrode site by averaging the corresponding trials with correct responses.
3. Result
Figs. 2 and 3 present the grand averaged ERPs of the four conditions at the representative electrodes. The first component was
N170, which was defined as the most negative peak at around
170 ms at bilateral-posterior sites. The second component was
P200, which was a positive wave distributed at the frontal-central
sites, peaking at around 220 ms. The third component was N400,
which was a slow negative wave. It peaked at around 350 ms
and was characterized as centroparietal distribution. The analysis
of N170 was performed by comparing the negative peak amplitude
within the time window from 100 to 200 ms. For the analyses of
P200 (170-270 ms) and N400 (300-450 ms), the effects of consistency and combinability were compared using the mean amplitude
values from the time windows of interest. Repeated measure ANOVAs were performed on these components, with consistency, phonetic combinability, and electrodes--which refers to a set of
electrodes at different recording locations on the scalp--as some
of the within-subject factors. For each ANOVA, the Greenhouse-
Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom was applied to correct for the violations of sphericity associated with repeated measures. Accordingly, for all the F tests with more than one degree of
freedom in the numerator, the corrected p-value is reported. The
post-hoc tests were carried out using Tukey's procedure.
3.1. N170
Four pairs of electrodes (P5/6, P7/8, PO5/6, and PO7/8) from the
left and right posterior areas were selected, since the reading-related N170 effect was prominent in these regions of the scalp
(Maurer, Brandeis, & McCandliss, 2005). The peak amplitude of
N170 was analyzed by a four-way ANOVA with consistency (high
and low), combinability (high and low), hemisphere (left and
right), and electrodes as within-subject factors. Neither character
consistency (F(1, 30) = 0.119, p > .1) nor phonetic combinability
(F(1, 30) = 1.108, p > .1) showed significant main effects. However,
the three-way interaction among consistency, combinability, and
electrodes was significant (F(3, 90) = 4.824, p < .05, e = .6). Posthoc tests showed that the interaction between consistency and

combinability was significant at PO7/8 (F(1, 30) = 6.130, p < .05),
PO5/6 (F(1, 30) = 7.756, p < .01) and P5/6 (F(1, 30) = 6.300, p < .05).
Specifically, there were significant phonetic combinability effects
in the reading of high consistency characters at PO7/8
(F(1, 30) = 7.089, p < .05), PO5/6 (F(1, 30) = 6.227, p < .05) and P5/6
(F(1, 30) = 5.799, p < .05). Fig. 3 indicates that at bilateral-poster
sites, high consistency/high phonetic combinability characters elicited more negative N170 than did high consistency/low phonetic
combinability characters. However, the combinability effect in
the reading of low consistency characters was not significant for
any electrode (p > .1).

trodes (F1, FZ, F3, FC1, FCZ, FC3, C1, CZ, and C3) were chosen for
analyzing P200. The mean amplitude of P200 was analyzed by a
three-way ANOVA that included consistency, combinability, and
electrodes as within-subject factors. The data revealed a significant
consistency effect (F(1, 30) = 11.789, p < .01), i.e., low consistency
characters demonstrated more positive P200 than did high consistency characters. Further, low phonetic combinability characters
revealed more positive P200 than did high phonetic combinability
characters, although this difference was only marginally significant
(F(1, 30) = 2.9, p = .09). No other two-way or three-way interaction
was found to be significant (p > .1).

entire scalp. Five electrodes (FZ, FCZ, CZ, CPZ, and PZ) were defined
as the electrode variable for the midline N400. Another ten electrodes (F5/6, FC5/6, C5/6, CP5/6, and P5/6) were selected for the
lateral N400. Accordingly, the midline N400 was tested by a
three-way ANOVA, which included character consistency, phonetic
combinability, and electrodes as within-subject factors, while the
lateral N400 was tested by a four-way ANOVA, which included
character consistency, phonetic combinability, hemisphere, and
electrodes as within-subject factors.
The midline analysis showed a significant consistency effect
(F(1, 30) = 11.716, p < .01). High consistency characters revealed
more negative N400 than did low consistency characters. However,
the phonetic combinability effect (F(1, 30) = 3.413, p = .07) was not
significant. None of the interactions were significant (p > .1). The
lateral analysis revealed significant main effects of consistency
(F(1, 30) = 10.492, p < .01) and combinability (F(1, 30) = 5.826,
p < .05). High consistency characters revealed more negative
N400 than did low consistency characters. In addition, high phonetic combinability characters revealed more negative N400 than
did low phonetic combinability characters. These two effects interacted neither with each other nor with hemisphere and electrodes
(p > .1).
3.4. Distribution
A distributional analysis with the time window as a factor was
conducted to test whether the consistency effects on P200 and
N400 have different topographical distributions. Twenty electrodes
across the scalp were selected for analyzing the scalp distribution,
which included electrodes on left-lateral sites (F5, FC5, C5, CP5, and
P5), left-medial sites (F1, FC1, C1, CP1, and P1), right-medial sites
(F2, FC2, C2, CP2 and P2) and right-lateral sites (F6, FC6, C6, CP6,
and P6). In the 170-270 ms and 300-450 ms time windows, the
difference waves of consistency effects (low minus high) in high

and low phonetic combinability conditions were normalized separately according to the procedure described in McCarthy and Wood
(1985). A five-way ANOVA including time windows (P200 vs.
N400), combinability (high vs. low), hemisphere (left vs. right), laterality (medial vs. lateral), and caudality as within-subject factors
was performed. The analysis showed a significant three-way interaction between time windows, hemisphere and caudality
(F(4, 120) = 3.486, p < .05, e = .79). Post- hoc tests showed that the
two-way interaction between hemisphere and caudality was more
significant at P200 (F(4, 120) = 10.742, p < .001, e = .737) than at
N400 (F(4, 120) = 3.675, p = .03, e = .807). For P200, caudality effect
at P200 was significant in both the left hemisphere
(F(4, 120) = 19.423, p < .0001, e = .372) and the right hemisphere
(F(4, 120) = 10.30, p < .001, e = .388). Specifically, in the left hemisphere, anterior electrodes revealed larger consistency effects than
did the posterior electrodes (F5/1 versus P5/1: p < .01; FC5/1 versus
P5/1: p < .01). However, in the right hemisphere, only central electrodes revealed larger P200 consistency effects than did posterior
electrodes (C6/2 versus P6/2: p < .05). As for N400, the caudality effect at N400 was pronounced in the left hemisphere
(F(4, 120) = 15.224, p < .0001, e = .417) and less significant in the
right hemisphere (F(4, 120) = 8.156, p < .01, e = .438). In the left
hemisphere, central electrodes revealed larger N400 consistency
effects than did the posterior electrodes (FC5/1 versus P5/1:
p < .01; C5/1 versus P5/1: p < .05). However, no any paired comparison of electrodes was significant in the right hemisphere. The distributional analysis demonstrated that the consistency effects at
P200 and N400 have different distributional characteristics.
3.5. Reanalysis based on phonological alternatives and phonological
family size
According to Lee et al. (2007), phonological alternatives is
defined as the number of pronunciations associated with a given

62

C.-H. Hsu et al. / Brain & Language 108 (2009) 56-66

phonetic radical, while phonological family size is defined as the
number of homophones within a selected phonological subgroup.
In this study, the simultaneous manipulation of phonological consistency and combinability implies that the difference in terms of
phonological alternatives and phonological family size between
high and low consistency will be much larger in the reading of high
combinability characters than in the reading of low combinability
characters. Based on the two-stage framework, the P200 indexes
reflect the variation in the mappings between orthography and
phonology, while the N400 indexes reflect the lexical competition
within the selected pronunciations (phonological subgroup). In
addition to the interaction at N170, we expected to observe interaction between consistency and combinability at both P200 and
N400. However, the data did not support this hypothesis. One possible explanation for the current findings is that we did not directly
manipulate the phonological family size and phonological alternatives. Instead, we assumed that these two indices might covariate
with the manipulation of consistency and combinability.
To further explore this possibility, we directly examined the phonological alternatives and phonological family sizes for all the stimuli. The mean of these values is provided in Table 2. The repeated
ANOVA measures revealed a significant interaction between consistency and combinability (phonological alternative: F(1, 29) = 6.883,
p < .05; phonological family size: F(1, 29) = 35.980, p < .001). However, when examining the distribution of the two indexes, we found
that the phonological family sizes of highly consistent and combinable characters ranged from 4 to 12, which partially overlapped with
those of the other three conditions (which ranged from 1 to 5). The
phonological family sizes for some of these characters (ranging from
4 to 5) could be smaller, and it is not necessary to display their difference between such characters and the low consistency/ high combinability characters.
To further examine whether the difference between the phonological family sizes of high and low consistency characters with
high combinability is insufficient to show consistency-by-combinability interaction at P200 and N400, we performed an additional
analysis by deleting seven items from the high consistency/high
combinability condition whose phonological family sizes were
lower than 5. The family sizes of the remaining 23 items averaged
at 7.74 and ranged from 6 to 12. Two participants were excluded
from further analysis due to an insufficient number of accepted trials in their data. Fig. 4 provides the reanalyzed ERP waveforms of
all four conditions and illustrates the consistency effects in the
high and low combinability conditions. The same designs of repeated-measure ANOVAs used in the previous analyses were performed on the corrected data sets to examine whether
consistency-by-combinability interaction could be found at N170,
P200, and N400. A planned comparison will be performed to test
for simple main effects of consistency on high and low combinability characters.
3.5.1. N170
Identical to the previous analysis, the peak amplitude of N170
was analyzed with a four-way ANOVA including the within-subject

factors of consistency, combinability, hemisphere, and electrodes
(P5/6, P7/8, PO5/6, and PO7/8). Neither character consistency
(F(1, 28) = .52, p > .1) nor phonetic combinability (F(1, 28) = 1.792,
p > .1) showed significant main effects. The two-way interaction between consistency and combinability (F(1, 28) = 4.813, p < .05), and
the three-way interaction among consistency, combinability, and
electrodes (F(3, 84) = 4.137, p < .05, e = .7) were significant. Posthoc tests demonstrated that the interaction between consistency
and combinability was significant at PO7/8 (F(1, 28) = 11.936,
p < .01), P5/6 (F(1, 28) = 10.010, p < .01) and PO5/6 (F(1, 28) =
14.116, p < .001). Specifically, there were significant phonetic combinability effects in high consistency characters at PO7/8
(F(1, 28) = 12.951, p < .01), P5/6 (F(1, 28) = 9.024, p < .01) and PO5/6
(F(1, 28) = 11.857, p < .01). That is, high consistency/high phonetic
combinability characters elicited more negative N170 than did high
consistency/low phonetic combinability characters at bilateral-posterior sites. However, the combinability effect in the reading of low
consistency characters was not significant for any electrode
(p > .1). On the other hand, the simple main effects of consistency
were significant in high phonetic combinability characters at PO7/
8 (F(1, 28) = 9.452, p < .01), P5/6 (F(1, 28) = 6.015, p < .05) and PO5/
6 (F(1, 28) = 10.286, p < .01). That is, high consistency/high phonetic
combinability characters elicited more negative N170 than did low
consistency/high phonetic combinability characters. However, the
consistency effect in the reading of low combinability characters
was not significant for any electrode (p > .1).
3.5.2. P200
The mean amplitude of P200 was analyzed by a three-way ANOVA that included consistency, combinability, and electrodes as
within-subject factors. The data revealed a significant consistency
effect (F(1, 28) = 8.346, p < .01). Low consistency characters revealed more positive P200 than did high consistency characters.
The main effect of combinability was not significant
(F(1, 28) = 2.456, p = .13), although the tendency of low phonetic
combinability characters remain to reveal more positive P200 than
did high phonetic combinability characters. The two-way interaction between consistency and combinability was not significant
(F(1, 28) = 1.244, p = .27). However, the planned comparison revealed a significant consistency effect in the reading of high combinability characters (F(1, 56) = 7.514, p = .008) thought not in the
reading of low combinability characters (p > .1).
3.5.3. N400
Identical to the previous analysis, the mean amplitude of N400
was divided for a midline analysis and lateral analysis. The midline
N400 was tested by a three-way ANOVA, which included character
consistency, phonetic combinability, and electrodes as within-subject factors, while the lateral N400 was tested by a four-way ANOVA, which included character consistency, phonetic combinability,
hemisphere, and electrodes as within-subject factors.
The midline analysis showed a significant consistency effect
(F(1, 28) = 6.813, p < .05), i.e., high consistency characters revealed
more negative N400 than did low consistency characters. The

phonetic combinability effect (F(1, 28) = 2.137, p = .15) and the
consistency-by-combinability interaction (F(1, 28) = 1.352, p = .25)
were not significant. The planned comparison demonstrated a significant consistency effect in the reading of high combinability
characters (F(1, 56) = 7.514, p = .008), but not in the reading of
low combinability characters (p > .1).
The lateral analysis revealed a significant consistency effect
(F(1, 28) = 8.098, p < .01) and a marginally significant combinability
effect (F(1, 28) = 3.841, p = .06). High consistency characters revealed more negative N400 than did low consistency characters.
In addition, high phonetic combinability characters revealed more
negative N400 than did low phonetic combinability characters. The
consistency-by-combinability interaction was not significant
(F(1, 28) = 0.003, p = .95). The planned comparison showed a marginally significant consistency effect in the reading of high combinability characters (F(1, 56) = 3.808, p = .050), and a significant

consistency effect in the reading of low combinability characters
(F(1, 56) = 4.137, p = .04).
In summary, for N170, the combinability effect was only found
in the reading of high consistency characters; further, characters
with higher phonetic combinability elicited greater negativity at
N170 than did those with lower phonetic combinability. Moreover,
the planned comparison showed that low consistency/high combinability characters produced more positive P200 and less negative N400 than did high consistency/high combinability characters.

4. General discussion
The present study aims to explore the relationship between
phonetic combinability and phonological consistency in the reading of Chinese phonograms. The main findings reveal a significant

64

C.-H. Hsu et al. / Brain & Language 108 (2009) 56-66

interaction between phonetic combinability and consistency at
N170 and consistency and combinability effects at P200 and
N400. These findings supported those in Lee et al. (2007) regarding
the consistency effect and further suggest the interplay between
orthographic density and the mapping of orthography to phonology in the different stages of lexical processing. The various aspects
of the psychological processes involved in reading linked to N170,
P200, and N400 will be discussed separately below.
4.1. N170
Interaction between phonetic combinability and consistency was
found at N170 in the bilateral occipital area, which demonstrated
that high phonetic combinability/high consistency characters elicited greater negativity at N170 than did low phonetic combinability/high consistency characters. The data are congruent with the
perceptual expertise account of N170. Studies have suggested the
N170 component as an index of orthographic detection at the initial
perceptual categorization stage (Bentin, Mouchetant-Rostaing,
Giard, Echallier, & Pernier, 1999; Maurer et al., 2005; Rossion, Joyce,
Cottrell, & Tarr, 2003). Increased N170 responses were elicited in the
stimulus category with which a person has extensive visual experience, such as the identification of faces (Rossion et al., 2003) and the
identification of birds/dogs (Tanaka & Curran, 2001). These results
suggest that extensive visual experience with an object category
leads to fast, specialized processing within the first 200 ms. In addition, the reading-related N170 effect can be found in the contrasts
between words and strings of meaningless symbols, forms, consonant strings, or shapes (Maurer et al., 2005; Schendan, Ganis, & Kutas, 1998). The perceptual expertise account may also account for
the combinability effect found at N170 in the current study and suggests that radical analysis occurs in the earlier stages of Chinese
reading. High combinability characters imply larger orthographic
neighborhoods, thus, they elicit greater activation at the perceptual
level than do low combinability characters.
The consistency-by-combinability interaction found at N170
suggests that the mapping of orthography to phonology influences
the earlier stages of orthographic processing (Goswami & Ziegler,
2006; Lee et al., 2007). This effect provides further support for the
phonological mapping hypothesis of the N170 word effect (Maurer
& McCandliss, 2007), according to which the left lateralization of
the reading-related N170 may reflect the involvement of spellingto-sound mapping during visual word recognition. Cross-linguistic
studies have shown that the reading of pseudowords elicits a lefthemisphere modulation at N170 in German, but not in English
(Maurer et al., 2005). A study involving Koreans who were educated
in both Chinese and written English reported a left-lateralized N170
effect for both English and Korean words but a bilateral N170 effect
for Chinese characters and pictures (Kim, Yoon, & Park, 2004). The
prominent difference in the comparisons between German and
English, and between English and Chinese lies in the level of orthography-to-phonology transparency. Such cross-linguistic differences
provide support for the phonological mapping hypothesis of the leftlateralized N170 effect. In addition, the consistency-by-combinability interaction found in the current study was a bilateral effect rather
than a left-lateralized effect. This also confirms the following proposition of the phonological mapping hypothesis: ``The left-lateralization of the N170 responses to visual words should be more
pronounced in scripts using grapheme-phoneme conversion rules,
but less pronounced in logographic scripts which are based on
lexical morphemes" (Maurer & McCandliss, 2007).
4.2. P200 and N400
This study demonstrated that low consistency characters produced more positive amplitude at P200 and less negative ampli-

tude at N400 than did high consistency characters. This finding
replicates Lee et al.'s (2007) results and supported the two-stage
framework for lexical access by using P200 and N400 to index
the earlier and later stages of lexical processing. For low consistency characters, more phonological alternatives can be associated with a given phonetic radical. This will cause greater
interference at the phonological level and thus show greater positivity at P200. On the other hand, given that phonetic combinability is matched between the high and low consistency
conditions, the phonological family size within a selected pronunciation or phonological subgroup of high consistency characters will be larger than that within a similar subgroup of low
consistency characters. Therefore, high consistency characters
would involve greater semantic competition at this stage and
display greater N400 than would low consistency characters.
The same framework can be used to explain the combinability
effect found at P200 and N400, wherein high phonetic combinability characters demonstrated less positive P200 and more
negative N400 than did low phonetic combinability characters.
According to the two-stage framework, high combinability (more
orthographic neighbors) facilitates character processing at the
orthographic level due to larger orthographic activation, consequently demonstrating less positivity at P200. A larger neighborhood size increases semantic competition, which in turn,
exaggerates the N400 effect ( Holcomb, Grainger, & O' Rourke,
2002).
The raw analysis of P200 and N400 demonstrated significant
main effects of consistency and combinability. However, there
was no interaction between these two factors. Although the
two-stage framework can account for these main effects, the
hypothesis that the consistency effect should be more salient
in the reading of phonograms with high phonetic combinability
was not supported. Lee et al. (2007) suggested that the number
of alternative pronunciations and the phonological family size
associated with a given character may be reflected at P200 and
N400. This study did not manipulate the phonological family size
and phonological alternatives directly and assumed that these
two indexes would covariate with the manipulation of consistency and combinability. To be more specific, a word with larger
combinability also implies that it has a larger phonological family size. By examining the phonological alternatives and phonological family sizes for all the stimuli, we found seven high
consistency and high combinability characters with relatively
small phonological family sizes. After deleting these items, the
planned comparison in the reanalysis revealed a significant consistency effect at P200 and N400 in the reading of high combinability characters. These findings support our speculation and
suggest that in the reading of Chinese phonograms, early specification of the pronunciations is carried out by selection among
the phonological alternatives associated with a given phonetic
radical. Then, presumably, semantic competition is performed
in the later stages among the candidates within a phonological
family. Most importantly, the lexical processing of character recognition correlates to the statistical mapping we observed between orthography, phonology, and semantics. Therefore, the
orthography-to- phonology transformation is not determined solely by the consistency between orthography and phonology but
also by the orthographic neighborhood size of the constitution
(e.g., the phonetic and semantic radicals) of the characters. Nevertheless, these results showed a tendency toward a larger consistency effect in the reading of high phonetic combinability
characters at P200 and N400 which were mainly based on
post-hoc reanalysis. Further investigation is needed to verify
how different aspects of phonological consistency influence the
reading of Chinese, in terms of the number of alternative pronunciations and the phonological family size.

C.-H. Hsu et al. / Brain & Language 108 (2009) 56-66

4.3. Implications for models of chinese character recognition
The current findings regarding combinability effects at P200
and N400 further support the lexical constituency model. Based
on this model, the radical-based inputs predict that words with
high combinability (i.e., those with more orthographic neighbors
sharing the same radical) result in larger orthographic activation
facilitate character processing at the early orthographic level, and
display less positive P200. In the later stage, a radical activates
more characters that share the same radical to reach the threshold,
and greater inhibition emerges at the lexical level and is reflected
by a larger N400. The data were congruent with previous studies
that demonstrated that P200 was reduced when a character shared
a radical with the preceding character and interpreted it as a graphic processing component (Liu et al., 2003). Meanwhile, this model emphasizes threshold-style, rather than cascade-style,
activation of phonology. The idea is that in an alphabetic system,
the word-level level units do not wait for a complete specification
of all the letter units before activating word-level phonology,
which is the so-called cascade style (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry,
Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001). However, in Chinese, the word-level
phonology is not activated prior to a full orthographic specification
of the characters, which is the threshold style. Based on this
assumption, the model predicts no phonological effect at the sublexical stage. Furthermore, characters sharing the same phonetic
radical but corresponding to a variety of pronunciations should elicit greater phonological interference or competition at the lexical
stage. However, our data showed an interaction between phonetic
combinability and consistency at N170 and a phonetic consistency
effect at P200, which suggest that the phonological computation
starts from the sublexical stage. Furthermore, given that phonetic
combinability was matched between the high and low consistency
conditions, the reading of high consistency characters, in fact,
elicited greater N400 than did the reading of low consistency characters. These findings cannot be reconciled by the current threshold-style lexical constituent model and suggested that the
greater N400 for the reading of high consistent characters resulted
from the lexical competition within a phonological family.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the data presented in this study support Lee
et al.'s (2007) findings regarding the consistency effect on several
ERP components that index the various stages of lexical processing.
Furthermore, our data demonstrates that the mapping of orthography to phonology interacts with the orthographic neighborhood
density. N170 has been used to index the perceptual expertise effect. Our data revealed that characters with larger orthographic
neighborhoods (i.e., characters that share the same phonetic radical) elicit greater N170 negativity, supporting the hypothesis that
a radical acts as a functional unit in Chinese character recognition.
Moreover, the combinability effect at N170 was modulated by phonological consistency, which supports the phonological mapping
hypothesis and suggests that the earlier stages of the visual word
recognition process are shaped by the mapping of orthography to
phonology even in Chinese. On the other hand, the presented combinability and consistency effects at P200 and N400 suggest that
both orthographic and phonological analyses are involved in the
early stages of radical activation and in the later stages of lexical
identification for Chinese character recognition. The reanalysis directly addressed the possible contribution of phonological alternatives and family size to the consistency effect observed at P200 and
N400 and suggested that the phonetic consistency effect mainly
originated from phonograms with high combinability and large
neighborhoods. Such a modulation effect may not be accounted

65

for by the lexical constituent model with the prior assumption of
threshold-style activation. Instead, we suggest that the consideration of cascaded-style processing and the implementation of the
feedback connections between orthographic, phonological, and
semantic lexicons in the framework of Chinese character recognition might be able to reconcile the current findings. Future computational and experimental studies could further examine the
relationship between semantic and phonetic radicals and their
interaction with orthography, phonology, and semantics.
