Abstract
We investigated the association between individual differences in metaphor understanding
and Theory of Mind (ToM) in typically developing children. We distinguished between
two types of metaphors and created a Physical and Mental Metaphors task, echoing a
similar distinction for ToM. Nine-year-olds scored lower than older age-groups in ToM
as well as in the interpretation of mental, but not physical, metaphors. Moreover, nineyear-olds (but not older children) who are better in ToM are also better in interpreting
mental, but not physical, metaphors. This suggests that the link between metaphor and
ToM is stronger when metaphorical interpretation involves mental aspects, and it is
more evident in early rather than later childhood.
Keywords: pragmatics; experimental pragmatics; figurative language

Introduction
Learning to understand metaphors is a complex task requiring the ability to adjust the
literal meaning of words and infer the speaker's meaning based on the communicative
context (Carston, 2010). As such, metaphor is a typical test ground in developmental
pragmatics (Grigoroglou & Papafragou, 2017; Noveck, Bianco, & Castry, 2001).
Classic literature is mostly based on verbal explanation tasks, requiring children to
paraphrase metaphorical sentences, and indicates that full-fledged metaphor
comprehension skills are not reached until adolescence. However, more recent
literature pointed out that simpler tasks, such as elicited repetition or object
substitution pretense, might reveal rudimentary metaphorical abilities already in
preschool children (Pouscoulous, 2014).
Whereas some authors emphasized the role of task demands, other authors reported
differences related to metaphor types. For instance, in a seminal study, Winner and
(c) Cambridge University Press 2018

394

Lecce et al.

colleagues (Winner, Rosenstiel, & Gardner, 1976) compared cross-sensory metaphors
(communicating an experience in one sensory modality by referring to another
sensory modality; e.g., Her perfume was bright sunshine) and psychological-physical
metaphors (communicating a psychological experience by appealing to the physical
domain; e.g., The prison guard was a hard rock) in a sample of children from six to
fourteen years. Comprehension was not accurate until the age of ten, and in general
psychological-physical metaphors were more difficult than cross-sensory ones. Other
studies too suggested a facilitation for metaphors based on perceptual aspects
(Vosniadou, Ortony, Reynolds, & Wilson, 1984; Wang & Dowker, 2010). Surprisingly,
the distinction between the sensory and psychological aspects of metaphors has
never been considered with respect to Theory of Mind (ToM), while it seems evident
that the two types differently capitalize on the ability to attribute mental states: one
case requires an inference about physical aspects of the metaphor's topic, whereas
the other involves an inference about mental aspects of the metaphor's topic. This
observation - i.e., that not all metaphors are equal when it comes to attribution of
mental states - constitutes the starting point of this work.
The role of ToM in metaphor processing is a largely debated topic in literature on
Autism Spectrum Disorder (Vulchanova, Saldana, Chahboun, & Vulchanov, 2015;
Whyte & Nelson, 2015). Earlier studies claimed that (first-order) ToM is necessary
to support metaphor comprehension (Happe, 1993), whereas more recent studies
emphasize the role of vocabulary abilities (Kalandadze, Norbury, Naerland, & Naess,
2018; Norbury, 2005). In contrast, very little has been done on typical development.
Considering other non-literal phenomena, Caillies and colleagues (Caillies & Le
Sourn-Bissaoui, 2008) found that ToM is to some extent a prerequisite for idiom
comprehension in five-, six-, and seven-year-olds, since idioms with plausible literal
meanings (e.g., break the ice) require some appearance/reality distinction. A more
sophisticated ToM is often assumed to be responsible for irony (Filippova &
Astington, 2008; Massaro, Valle, & Marchetti, 2013), although results are conflicting
(Bosco & Gabbatore, 2017). For metaphor, however, despite a sizable literature on
developmental trends, few studies have considered individual differences in ToM.
Moreover, none has distinguished between metaphor types, which seems to us a
useful strategy to unpack the broad findings of association between ToM and
pragmatics in development (Matthews, Biney, & Abbot-Smith, 2018).
This study focused on the relationships between ToM and metaphor understanding
in development by adopting an individual differences approach and by also considering
different types of metaphors. The study has two main aims. First, we aimed at
investigating similarities and differences in developmental changes of the two focus
constructs - metaphor understanding and ToM - in children from nine to twelve.
This age range was selected because it is crucial for the development of both ToM
(Lecce, Bianco, Devine, & Hughes, 2017) and metaphoric understanding (Winner
et al., 1976). Importantly, we distinguished (both in ToM and in metaphors)
between items that require inference on mental attributes and those requiring
inferences on physical attributes. Specifically, we used a set of materials including
metaphors with preferred physical (e.g., Dancers are butterflies) and preferred mental
interpretation (Daddy is a volcano), echoing the distinctions between physical and
mental inferences tested in a classic ToM task such as the Strange Stories. We called
this task the `Physical and Mental Metaphors task'. Both accuracy and interpretation
were measured, allowing for a fine-grained analysis focusing on the mechanisms of
metaphor interpretation rather than simply on the ability to understand it. We

expected to observe a change in performance at the age of ten, both for ToM and for
metaphor understanding, in line with previous literature, and that such change would
be more evident for the interpretation of mental metaphors. Second, we aimed at
assessing the relationship between individual differences in ToM and interpretation
of physical vs. mental metaphors in different age-groups. Here, we expected
significant associations between ToM and the interpretation of mental, but not
physical, metaphors. In doing so, we controlled for children's receptive language and
working memory, which are known be related to both metaphors (Carriedo, Corral,
Montoro, Herrero, Ballestrino, & Sebastian, 2016; Norbury, 2005) and ToM (Happe,
1995; Lecce et al., 2017).
Method
Participants
We recruited 217 participants, ranging in age from nine to twelve years. The sample was
made up of four age-groups: 62 nine-year-olds (33 F, Mage = 9;6, SD = 3 months, age
range = 9;0-9;12), 48 ten-year-olds (21 F, Mage = 10;5, SD = 3 months, age range =
10;0-10;12), 51 eleven-year-olds (26 F, Mage = 11;5, SD = 3 months, age range = 11;0-
11;12), and 56 twelve-year-olds (20 F, Mage = 12;4, SD = 3 months, age range = 12;1-
12;10). Participants were recruited through local elementary and secondary schools.
All of the children were fluent Italian speakers, and none had a history of developmental
delay or learning disorder. Most of the children came from affluent families. Specifically,
when the Family Affluence Scale (FAS; see below for details; Currie, Molcho, Boyce,
Holstein, Torsheim, & Richter, 2008) was used to categorize the sample, 84.90% of the
sample was classed as `high affluence' (range = 6-9), 14.70% as `middle affluence' (range
= 3-5), and just one child (0.5%) as `low affluence' (range = 0-2). In terms of family
structure, 21.10% of the children were singletons, 56.90% had one sibling, 17% had two
siblings, 3.70% had three siblings, and 1.40% had four or more siblings.

Procedure
Parental written consent was obtained for all participants. Data collection took place at
the beginning of the school year. Children completed all the tasks individually at school
during class time.

Measures
Socio-economic status
This was measured with the Family Affluence Scale (Currie et al., 2008), a short
questionnaire with questions on family wealth: family car ownership (range = 0-2),
participants having/not having their own unshared room (range = 0-1), number of
computers at home (range = 0-3), and number of times the participants went on a
holiday during the past year (range = 0-3). Responses were summed into an overall
index (range = 0-9).
Verbal ability
This was measured with the Italian version of the Vocabulary subtest of the Primary
Mental Abilities (PMA) (Rubini & Rossi, 1982), requiring children to find the

396

Lecce et al.

synonyms of 50 target words choosing among four alternatives. A time limit of 6 min
was set. Total scores ranged from 0 to 50.
Working memory
This was measured with the Backward Digit Span task from the Italian version of the
WISC-R (Orsini, 1997). Children listened to a series of digit sequences and were asked
to recall them in reverse order. Children completed seven sequences of digits. The
number of digits in each sequence increased from two to eight. Each sequence was
marked as a pass (1) or fail (0), and total scores ranged from 0 to 7.
Theory of Mind
This was evaluated with the Strange Stories task (Happe, 1994), which consists of short
stories depicting social situations followed by an open-ended question that requires
participants to explain a character's behavior. We administered five mental stories,
two involving double bluff, two involving misunderstanding, and one involving
persuasion, together with three physical/control stories. After reading the stories,
children were asked to explain a character's sentence in a written format. No time
limit was imposed. In line with scoring guidelines (White, Hill, Happe, & Frith,
2009), we rated children's answers on a 3-point scale: 0 for an incorrect answer,
1 for a partially correct and implicit answer, and 2 for a full and explicit answer.
Total scores ranged from 0 to 10 points for mental stories and from 0 to 6 for
physical stories. A second rater independently coded 25% of the responses and
inter-rater agreement was established using Cohen's kappa (k = .85).
Physical and Mental Metaphors task
We constructed a set of metaphors in Italian, following the prototypical `X is Y'
structure, where X is the topic and Y the vehicle of the metaphor, and distinguishing
between two types of metaphor: physical and mental. In the physical metaphors,
persons (X) are associated with non-human entities (Y) based on physical features;
in the mental metaphors, persons (X) are associated with non-human entities (Y)
based on psychological features. Thus, in order to understand physical metaphors,
inferences on appearance features or behaviors of the topic are needed, whereas, in
order to understand mental metaphors, inferences on mental states of the topic are
needed. The physical metaphors were: (1) Dancers are butterflies, (2) Climbers are
squirrels, and (3) Players are elephants. The mental metaphors were: (4) Soldiers are
lions, (5) Daddy is a volcano, and (6) The teacher is an icicle. Metaphors 1, 2, 3, and
4 were taken from Bambini, Ghio, Moro, and Schumacher (2013); Metaphor 5 was
adapted from Pinto, Melogno, and Iliceto (2006).
We selected the metaphors in such a way that they were easy to understand for
children, and balanced for lexical frequency and familiarity, differing only in the
preferred interpretation (either physical or mental). To verify this, a number of
measures were collected, following the standards for the construction of metaphor
datasets (Bambini, Resta, & Grimaldi, 2014). See Table 1 for collected values and
statistics. All target words were included in a frequency dictionary of child language
(Marconi, Ott, Pesenti, Ratti, & Tavella, 1994), with no differences in lexical
frequency between the target words in the physical and in the mental sets.
Familiarity was checked with an online rating task, by means of a 7-point Likert
scale, administered to 52 young adults. Participants were required to answer the
question "How familiar is this metaphor?", selecting a value from 1 ("not familiar at

Notes. Frequency measures were collected using the Lessico Elementare (Marconi et al., 1994), a frequency dictionary of school-age children's language including 6095 lemmas, whereas familiarity
scores (on a 7-point scale), scores in the categorical task (physical vs. mental interpretation), and scores in the parametric task (physical and mental attributes, on a 7-point scale) were collected
from samples of young adults. For frequency, familiarity, and the parametric task scores, the Table reports mean and SD in parenthesis. For the categorical task scores, the Table reports mean
agreement and range in parenthesis. For the statistics on frequency, we employed the Welch Two Sample t-test on log-transformed values. The chi-squared analysis on categorical scores was also
run on each metaphor, being highly significant in all cases (metaphor 1,  2 = 31, df = 1, p = < .001; metaphor 2,  2 = 31, df = 1, p = < .001; metaphor 3,  2 = 23.52, df = 1, p = < .001; metaphor 4,  2 =
17.065 df = 1, p = < .001; metaphor 5,  2 = 23.5, df = 1, p = < .001; metaphor 6  2 = 31, df = 1, p = < .001).

all") to 7 ("totally familiar"), and trying to use all values in the scale. Familiarity was
explained to participants in the following way: "Familiarity judgment expresses how
much the metaphor sounds familiar to you, that is how much it seems to you that
you have heard or used the metaphor in the presented form or in a similar form."
Obtained scores were around medium values (i.e., around the middle of the scale),
indicating that the selected metaphors are not lexicalized, with no differences across
sets. The distinction between physical and mental metaphors was checked through
two tasks: (i) categorical and (ii) parametric. (i) Categorical task: 31 young adults
blind to the hypothesis of the study were asked to classify each metaphor as referring
either to physical or to mental attributes. For metaphors in the physical set,
agreement on physical interpretation was >95% and for metaphors in the mental set,
agreement on mental interpretation was >90%, with highly significant chi-square for
each set and for each metaphor. (ii) Parametric task: 52 young adults blind to the
hypothesis of the study were asked to rate each metaphor for physical attributes
("How much does this metaphor express physical attributes?") and for mental
attributes ("How much does this metaphor express mental attributes?") with an
online task and by means of a 7-point Likert scale. Metaphors in the physical set
scored significantly higher on physical attributes than metaphors in the mental set.
Metaphors in the mental set scored significantly higher on mental attributes than
metaphors in the physical set. Interestingly, within each set, when considering the
difference between the two interpretations (the absolute value of the difference
between the mean score on the physical attributes and the mean score on the mental
attributes), the value was significantly higher for metaphors in the physical compared
with the mental set. Overall, these data support the distinction between the physical
and the mental sets, and also indicate that metaphors in the physical set tended to
have a straightforwardly physical interpretation, while metaphors in the mental set
were also open to physical interpretations.
Children were required to explain the meaning conveyed by each metaphor, after an
example item considered together with the examiner. Questions and answers were oral.
Children's answers were coded according to the level of (i) accuracy (defined as the
ability to articulate the link between the topic and the vehicle) and (ii) interpretation
(either physical or mental). Distinguishing these two levels - often blended in
previous studies - allowed us to make a fine-grained analysis on interpretation rather
than simply on the ability to understand a metaphor. Specifically, this scoring
allowed us to take into account cases in which children gave plausible, yet physical
interpretations of metaphors in the mental set, and vice versa. Accuracy was coded
on a three-step scale following previous studies in the field of figurative language
comprehension (Melogno, Pinto, & Di Filippo, 2017; Vulchanova, Vulchanov, &
Stankova, 2011): Incorrect responses scored 0, correct metaphorical responses scored
2, and responses where the participant had attempted a metaphorical albeit
somewhat incomplete interpretation received a score of 1. More specifically, a 0 score
was assigned when the child: (a) declares he/she does not know/understand, (b)
interprets the metaphor literally (e.g., for the metaphor "Soldiers are lions", "They
hunt well"), or (c) gives an incorrect response ("They are careful"). A 1 score was
assigned when children's answer: (a) is incomplete ("They are very good") or (b)
refers to a non-salient feature of the metaphor vehicle ("They run as fast as lions").
A 2 score was assigned when children's answer is complete and refers to the salient
features of the metaphor vehicle ("They are strong"; "They are courageous").
Accuracy total scores ranged from 0 to 6 points for both the physical and the mental

Journal of Child Language

metaphor sets. Interpretation was coded on a two-step scale. A 0 score was given if
children's answer referred to physical attributes ("They are strong") or actions ("They
run fast") of the topic. A 1 score was given if children's answer referred to
psychological attributes of the topic ("They are courageous"; "They are aggressive").
Interpretation total scores ranged from 0 to 3 points for both the physical and the
mental metaphor sets. A second rater independently coded 25% of the responses and
inter-rater agreement was established using Cohen's kappa (for the physical set,
k = .96 for accuracy and k = .88 for interpretation; for the mental set, k = .98 for
accuracy and k = .94 for interpretation).
Data analysis
We performed three sets of analyses. The first set was intended as a validation of the
materials in the metaphor task, to ensure high accuracy for all items and different
interpretations across the physical and the mental sets. The second set included a
series of ANOVAs to assess developmental changes for each study-variable. The
scores on control (verbal ability and working memory) and focus variables (ToM
and metaphor interpretation for the physical and the mental sets) were submitted to
an ANOVA with Age-Group (four levels) as between-subject variable. The third set
of analyses comprised correlations and partial correlations (controlling for verbal
ability, working memory, and socioeconomic status) between ToM and metaphor
interpretation for the physical and the mental sets.
Results
Metaphor understanding and interpretation
We first checked the level of accuracy in the children's answers in the Physical and Mental
Metaphors task. As expected, the great majority of children scored high on this index, with
98.2% and 92.2% of children showing a performance that was equal or bigger than 3 on
the total score for the physical and the mental metaphor set, respectively. This result
allowed us to focus on interpretation, rather than accuracy, in the main analyses. As
expected, children scored higher in interpretations of metaphors in the mental set (total
score = 1.92, SD = .77) than in the physical set (total score = 0.07, SD = .26), that is they
were more likely to refer to mental states when interpreting a mental metaphor than a
physical one (t(216) = 32.88, p = .000). The correlation between interpretation scores for
physical and mental metaphors was not significant (r(217) = -0.04, p = .56), as a further
indication that the type of interpretation was different for each set.
Developmental effects
Descriptive analyses for all age-groups are reported in Table 2. The ANOVA showed a
main effect on verbal ability (F(3,213) = 23.98, p < .001,  2p = .25). Post-hoc Bonferroni
comparisons showed that verbal ability of nine-year-olds was significantly lower than
that of each of the other age-groups, and that verbal ability of ten-year-olds was
significantly lower than that of twelve-year-olds. No other contrast reached
significance. The ANOVA also showed a significant effect on working memory
(F(3,213) = 5.98, p = .001,  2p = .08). Post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons showed that
the working memory of nine-year-olds was significantly lower than that eleven- and
twelve-year-olds. No other contrast reached significance.

Regarding ToM, we found a main effect of mental (F(3,213) = 7.09, p < .001,
 2p = .09), but not control Strange Stories (F(3,213) = 2.36, p = .07,  2p = .03).
Bonferroni comparisons showed that ToM of nine-year-olds was significantly lower
than that of each of the other age-groups. No other contrast reached significance.
Regarding metaphor interpretation, our analyses showed a main effect on mental
(F(3,213) = 3.59, p = .01,  2p = .04) but not physical metaphors (F(3,213) = 1.67,
p = .18,  2p = .02). Post-hoc analyses showed that the mental interpretation of
nine-year-olds was significantly lower than that of eleven- and twelve-year-olds. No
other contrast reached significance. Here it is also important to note that, in each
age-group, accuracy in the mental set was actually significantly higher than accuracy
in the physical set (ts  2.66, p = .01).
Associations between ToM and metaphors
Results of the correlational analysis on each age-group between individual differences in
interpreting mental vs. physical metaphors and the Strange Stories task are reported in
Table 3. Individual differences in interpreting mental metaphors were significantly
correlated with those in mental stories of the Strange Stories in nine-year-olds (r(62)
= 0.37, p = .003), but not in any other age-group. This association (interpretation of
mental metaphors with mental Strange Stories) remained significant even when we
controlled for verbal ability, working memory, and socioeconomic status (r(57) =
0.34, p = .008). Importantly, the association remained significant also when we
controlled for the above factor plus accuracy in the interpretation of mental
metaphors (r(56) = 0.32, p = .01). Table 3 also shows that in nine-year-olds and in
eleven-year-olds there was a significant association between the interpretation of
mental metaphors and control stories of the Strange Stories task; however, the value
of these correlations fell below significance when we controlled for verbal ability,
working memory, and socioeconomic status (r(57) = 0.27, p = .06, and r(57) = 0.23,
p = .12, respectively). Overall, in nine-year-olds, the association between metaphor
interpretation and Strange Stories was specific for mental items and did not extend to
the physical/control ones. There was no significant correlation between the
interpretation of mental metaphors and control stories of the Strange Stories task and,
on the same lines, no significant association between the interpretation of physical
metaphors and mental stories of the Strange Stories task. No significant correlation
between ToM and metaphor interpretation was found in any other age-groups.
Discussion
This study investigated the relationships between ToM and metaphor understanding by
distinguishing between two types of metaphors in the Physical and Mental Metaphors
task. The first aim was to explore developmental changes in metaphor comprehension
and in ToM across middle childhood. Although all children scored high in accuracy,
our findings showed that nine-year-olds performed lower than the other age-groups
(who did not differ significantly from one another) in the interpretation of mental,
but not physical metaphors. This confirms our hypothesis and is in line with
previous evidence suggesting that metaphor comprehension starts to be accurate at
about ten years of age (Winner et al., 1976). Interestingly, idiom comprehension also
starts approximating adult-like knowledge around age ten (Kempler, VanLancker,
Marchman, & Bates, 1999; Vulchanova et al., 2011), indicating that this stage might

be critical for different forms of figurative language. Moreover, we observed a similar
result for ToM development, where nine-year-olds performed significantly lower
than the other age-groups. Again, this result is in line with existing literature
showing that the development of ToM, measured via the Strange Stories, does not
follow a linear pattern of change across middle childhood (Lecce et al., 2017; Lecce,
Zocchi, Pagnin, Palladino, & Taumoepeau, 2010). The important and novel finding
here is the observation of a parallel in developmental timing, with the age of ten
marking a significant difference with respect to the age of nine both in ToM and in
the interpretation of mental metaphors. This parallel in development suggests that
there may well be a relationship between ToM and the interpretation of the
psychological attributes of metaphors.
This consideration brings us to the individual differences issue, and the second main
result of this study. Independently of verbal ability and working memory, nineyear-olds (but not older children) who are better in ToM are also more likely to
better understand mental, but not physical, metaphors. This suggests that: (i) the
association between metaphor comprehension and ToM is not general, but rather
specific for those metaphors whose interpretation requires an inference on mental
states, and (ii) the association between interpreting mental metaphors and ToM
changes across development, being stronger in earlier developmental phases. We
believe that these findings have important implications on the relation between
metaphor and ToM and, more generally, on the relation between pragmatics and ToM.
About (i), our results support the theoretical distinction between physical and
mental metaphors, and suggest that not all metaphors are interpreted through the
same strategy, i.e., not all metaphors recruit ToM skills to the same degree. The level
of the inference to be drawn (e.g., physical vs. mental) might indeed play a role in

modulating the involvement of the ToM system. Although we acknowledge that
pragmatic interpretation always requires a certain degree of attribution of intentions
(Sperber & Wilson, 2002), our data suggest that this might be a basic level of the
communication process, beyond which ToM involvement might vary depending on
the metaphor's type. Metaphor capitalizes on the context-based enrichment of lexical
meanings through promoting and elaborating some properties of the encoded
concepts, while dropping others (Carston, 2010). When the relevant properties refer
to mental aspects (as, e.g., in the case of Daddy is a volcano), the ToM load is likely
to increase. A similar view is supported by a recent study on children with Autism
Spectrum Disorder, where cognitive training differently affected psychological and
sensory metaphor comprehension (Melogno et al., 2017). This suggests that the
interpretation of the two types of metaphor requires, at least in part, different skills.
Crucially, in everyday communication, metaphors often refer to emotions and
mental states, whereby they illuminate psychological experiences through concrete
concepts (Kovecses, 2003). Studies on adults processing metaphors have often pointed
to the involvement of ToM brain circuitry (Bambini, Gentili, Ricciardi, Bertinetto, &
Pietrini, 2011), which - we argue - might be especially driven by the mental aspects of
metaphorical interpretations. Future studies employing a larger number of stimuli than
the sample used here, and possibly measuring brain correlates, might further elucidate
how specific the involvement of ToM is for certain metaphors.
About (ii), i.e., a stronger relation between the interpretation of mental metaphor
and ToM at an earlier age, our results offer a novel developmental angle to the
debate over the relation between metaphor (and pragmatics) and ToM. A closer
inspection to the literature on ToM and other non-literal language aspects reveals
that evidence in favor of a relation between the two is usually based on data from
young children (Caillies & Le Sourn-Bissaoui, 2008). Thus, a likely scenario is that
the link between metaphor interpretation and ToM is stronger in earlier ages, but it
becomes looser in later stages. A similar pattern can be found considering the
association between ToM and language (receptive and expressive), which is strong in
preschoolers (Milligan, Astington, & Dack, 2007) and seems to become weaker across
middle childhood (Lecce et al., 2010).
An alternative interpretation might be that our results are due to the fact that all agegroups are good in physical metaphors, suggesting that they have mastered them, and it
is only in the domain of mental metaphors that differences can be observed. However,
this interpretation is unlikely for two reasons. First, our main analyses focused on
interpretation rather than on accuracy, and thus our results cannot be simply
explained by a difference in the level of difficulty between the two sets of metaphors.
Second, when we checked differences in the level of accuracy between the two sets,
we found that, in each age-group, the accuracy in the mental set was actually
significantly higher than accuracy in the physical set. Hence, the explanation that the
link between ToM and metaphor interpretation becomes weaker over development
seems more likely.
More generally, our result is in accordance with Karmiloff-Smith's model of the
progressive modularization and specialization of cognitive skills (Karmiloff-Smith,
1995). Interestingly, the literature on metaphor processing in adults is compatible
with this view, as it does not offer compelling evidence of a strong relationship with
ToM, while in contrast emphasizing the role of other components such as working
memory and executive control (Chiappe & Chiappe, 2007; Columbus, Sheikh,
Cote-Lecaldare, Hauser, Baum, & Titone, 2015). Very few studies explicitly tested the

404

Lecce et al.

relation between adults' performance in metaphor tasks and in ToM. In an eyemovement study, participants' reading patterns were shown to be influenced by
cognitive factors but not by socio-cognitive skills such as those measured in the
Emotional Stroop task (Olkoniemi, Ranta, & Kaakinen, 2016). A study on the
Reading the Mind in the Eyes test showed that individual differences in ToM were
related to figurative language comprehension skills, but this relation was not
independent from the general intelligence level (Peterson & Miller, 2012). It is
possible that the relation between metaphor comprehension and ToM is stronger in
neurodevelopmental disorders and other clinical conditions such as schizophrenia
(Bosia et al., 2016; Champagne-Lavau & Stip, 2010; Happe, 1993), although the issue
is debated (Andres-Roqueta & Katsos, 2017; Norbury, 2005), but this does not seem
to explain individual differences in the healthy population. To properly test this
account, and the hypothesis that the link between metaphor interpretation and ToM
progressively loosens from middle childhood into adult full-fledged competence,
future studies involving younger and older child groups, and possibly adopting a
lifespan perspective, are needed.
Our study has important limitations that should be acknowledged and that
correspond to future research directions. The first regards the ToM measure used:
the Strange Stories task. Here, it is important to note that, for time reasons, we have
included only three physical/control stories, and this may have reduced the
variability in the total score. Future studies with a higher number of items are
therefore needed. In addition, as recently outlined by Bosco and colleagues, the
Strange Stories task is a verbal task that may imply the ability to understand
language in the given context (Bosco, Tirassa, & Gabbatore, 2018). Although we
acknowledge that, generally speaking, there may be an overlap between ToM and
pragmatics in the Strange Stories, we argue that this is not a major issue in the
present study for at least two reasons. First, we selected a subset of Strange Stories
items, avoiding the items more closely related to non-literal speech. Second, this
overlap cannot explain our finding with respect to the change in the association
between ToM and metaphor across ages. Future studies are certainly needed to
explore the link between ToM and metaphor understanding using non-verbal ToM
tasks, such as the Triangle task (Castelli, Happe, Frith, & Frith, 2000). The second
limitation regards the use of a vocabulary task to assess children's language. The
literature - especially on atypical development - offers much evidence on the impact
of language comprehension abilities, including competence in structural aspects, on
figurative language understanding (Gernsbacher & Pripas-Kapit, 2012; Vulchanova
et al., 2015). Although the Physical and Mental Metaphors task was developed to be
easy to understand, future studies using more comprehensive measures of language
(including grammar) are needed to disentangle the relationship between the
development of linguistic competence and of metaphor understanding. The third
limitation concerns our participants, who belong primarily to affluent families. Given
that ToM development, at least in preschool years, is associated with family
background (Slaughter & De Rosnay, 2017), future research on ToM and metaphors
in low-income children would be interesting.
Perhaps the most important limitation of the present study lies in its design and in
the type of information provided by the correlational analysis, which can suggest
association but cannot support claims on causality between ToM and metaphor
understanding. Although a correlation study can be viewed as a first necessary step
when investigating a new topic, this approach leaves open the question of whether

Journal of Child Language

405

ToM is a prerequisite for metaphor, or for specific types of metaphor only. Future
research should investigate more deeply the nature and the direction of the
relationship between ToM and the understanding of mental vs. physical metaphors.
One obvious candidate is to use a longitudinal study; such a design would indeed
enable us to understand if ToM promotes the development of pragmatics in typically
developing children or if, to the contrary, pragmatics predicts the development of
ToM. A developmental study would also help discriminate between divergent
theoretical positions such as pragmatic accounts of ToM (Westra & Carruthers,
2017) and more ToM oriented accounts of pragmatics (Sperber & Wilson, 2002).
Overall, our study contributes to the clarification of the relations between ToM and
pragmatics in middle childhood, with two main strengths. The first is the distinction
between two types of metaphor, physical and mental. These two types require
inferences on two different levels, an aspect which has been little considered in the
literature on metaphor. The second is the developmental angle of the study,
which covers a wide age-range and showed not only that there is a parallel in
developmental timing between the interpretation of the mental aspects of a metaphor
and ToM, but also that the association between the two is stronger in earlier ages.
Besides the theoretical implications, our work might also have practical ones.
Non-literal language is a fragile aspect of children's pragmatic competence, and our
work might help shaping training programs based on a careful consideration of the role
of ToM for the understanding of certain linguistic expressions.
