ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

The representation of abstract and concrete concepts has long been a debated question in the
literature. In previous work, we created a semantic space which was able to model abstract and
concrete concepts in a single multidimensional space. In this study, we tested the validity of our
semantic space by comparing it with Latent Semantic Analysis in a word relatedness task during
eyetracking. We measured reaction time, gaze measures, and pupil dilation. The results of our
study revealed that the newly created space was valid and not just a product of our data. Our
ability to simulate a high dimensional semantic space represents a step forward in our
understanding of the representation of concepts.

Introduction
Cognitive representational differences between concrete
and abstract words have been an extensive focus of
semantic memory research. Many have postulated that
concrete concepts such as DOG and HAMMER are represented in the brain differently than abstract concepts
such as LOVE and MAGNITUDE as they require separate
orthogonal representational systems (e.g. language
versus visual semantics; Paivio, 1991). These putative
multiple semantics approaches have been buoyed by
performance discrepancies between concrete and
abstract words across various cognitive-linguistic
domains; a phenomenon termed the word concreteness
effect. There is a growing push in the literature that
strives to find a way to model abstract and concrete concepts in a manner that allows for comparisons across
concepts of differing concreteness (Reilly, Peelle, &
Grossman, 2007; Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis, & Garrett,
2004). These models attempt to more parsimoniously
model the representation of concepts relative to more
classic theories of abstract/concrete concept representation. The paucity of research into the representation
of abstract concepts, however, has made it difficult to
describe a unified model, and for this reason theories
such as the Dual Coding Theory (Paivio, 1991), remain
the dominant account of abstract-concrete word
representation.
We recently reported an innovative way of elucidating
the cognitive topography of abstract concepts and concrete concepts using a combination of factor analysis

and hierarchical clustering (Crutch, Troche, Reilly, &
Ridgway, 2013; Troche, Crutch, & Reilly, 2014). The validity of these data, however, remains an open question.
In this study, we used eyetracking and a word relatedness task to determine the validity of the previously
reported data.
Concreteness is a psycholinguistic construct that
describes the extent to which an object can be experienced through the senses (Paivio, Yuille, & Madigan,
1968). The concreteness effect can be described as the
collective advantage that concrete concepts have over
abstract concepts in a variety of domains. This advantage
has been seen in recall accuracy (Walker & Hulme, 1999),
word recognition(Schwanenflugel, Harnishfeger, &
Stowe, 1988), word list memory (Allen & Hulme, 2006),
naming latency (Bleasdale, 1987), age of acquisition (Gilhooly & Logie, 1980), and sensitivity to neurological
injury (Bonner et al., 2009; Breedin, Saffran, & Coslett,
1994; Franklin, Howard, & Patterson, 1995; Jefferies, Patterson, Jones, & Lambon Ralph, 2009; Warrington, 1975,
1981). Two dominant theories attempt to explain the
concreteness effect: the Context Availability Model
(Schwanenflugel et al., 1988; Schwanenflugel & Shoben,
1983) and the Dual Coding Theory (DCT; Clark & Paivio,
1991; Paivio, 1991).
The CAM proposes the dissociation between abstract
and concrete concepts is due to differences in verbal
context. In the CAM, verbal context can be understood
as information (supplied by discourse or the individual's
prior knowledge) that allows for the enriched association

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

between concepts. Increased association is postulated to
lead to a richer representation of the concept in the brain
(Schwanenflugel et al., 1988; Schwanenflugel & Shoben,
1983). Concrete concepts, therefore, display the advantage seen in the concreteness effect due to greater availability of contextual information. Stronger availability of
contextual information for concrete concepts can be
illustrated by comparing a concrete concept such as
DOG with an abstract concept such as MAGNITUDE.
While associated perceptual information for a concept
such as DOG (e.g. leash, bowl) is readily available, analogous relations for a concept such as MAGNITUDE are less
available.
Dual Coding Theory (DCT) is an expansive theory that
not only explains the concreteness effect but also can be
understood as a more general cognitive theory (Paivio,
2013). DCT is premised upon the existence of two parallel
semantic systems. One component system is dedicated
to verbal semantics (i.e. linguistic associations), whereas
the other is dedicated to sensory-based feature knowledge (i.e. imaginal semantics). Paivio argues that these
systems (or codes) are dissociable but also highly interactive. Concrete words have both sensory and verbal representations and are as such dually coded. In contrast,
abstract words inherently lack sensory salience and are,
therefore, exclusively coded within the verbal semantic
system.
Both the DCT and CAM argue that the impoverished
representations of abstract concepts have led to differences between abstract and concrete concepts. More
recently, two theories have moved from attempting
to explain the differences between abstract and concrete concepts in a quantitative way to a qualitative
one. The first theory postulated by Crutch and colleagues (Crutch & Jackson, 2011; Crutch & Warrington,
2005) argues that abstract and concrete concepts
differ based on their relative reliance on association
or similarity. They postulate that abstract concepts
rely more heavily on associations while concrete concepts rely more heavily on similarity. In other words,
concrete concepts such as DOG would rely more
heavily on a similar concept such as CAT than an
associated concept such as LEASH to support the
concept. On the other hand, LOVE would rely more
on an associated concept such as HATE than a similar
concept such as AFFECTION.
Kousta and colleagues (Kousta, Vigliocco, Vinson,
Andrews, & Del Campo, 2011; Vigliocco et al., 2013)
offer a theory that focuses on the role of emotion information. Weak embodiment theories have argued that
emotion may play a role in the representation of concepts (Andrews, Vigliocco, & Vinson, 2009). Kousta
and colleagues, however, frame their theory similarly

699

to DCT and argue that concrete concepts are supported
by both the verbal and sensorimotor systems. They
differ in that Kousta and colleagues argue that abstract
concepts are not only supported by verbal systems but
also by emotion information. At first glance this theory
would seem to be incompatible with well-established
concreteness effects in the literature, however, Kousta
et al. (2011; Vigliocco et al., 2013) found that when
certain psycholinguistic characteristics, such as imageability and context availability, are controlled for, the
concreteness effect disappears and even slightly
reverses. These findings have been supported by
more recent work (Moffat, Siakaluk, Sidhu, & Pexman,
2015; Newcombe, Campbell, Siakaluk, & Pexman,
2012) although they are not without controversy (See
Paivio, 2013).
These theories offer weak embodiment accounts for
the representation of abstract concepts. Embodied theories hold that the brain decomposes objects into discrete sets of features and stores such features within a
massively distributed network mirroring perception
(e.g. visual features are stored proximal to the visual
cortex; Barsalou, 2008; Gallese & Lakoff, 2005; Martin,
2007). Determining the features of concrete concepts
has been mostly investigated through the use of
feature listing approaches (Cree & McRae, 2003;
Garrard, Lambon-Ralph, Hodges, & Patterson, 2001;
Tyler, Moss, Durrant-Peatfield, & Levy, 2000). While this
approach has shown some utility for abstract concepts
(Wiemer-Hastings & Xu, 2005) these feature listing
approaches are better suited for concrete concepts.
This is best illustrated by trying to determine the features
of DRILL as opposed to the features of MAGNITUDE. From
a psycholinguistic perspective, it became increasingly
clear that discerning the semantic topography of
abstract concepts as well as concrete concepts would
require a unique approach that extended beyond sensorimotor features. Crutch and colleagues piloted a solution to the shortcomings of the feature listing
approach in the form of the abstract conceptual
feature (ACF) rating approach (Crutch, Williams,
Ridgway, & Borgenicht, 2012). This method involved participants rating 50 abstract concepts on a 7 point Likert
scale across a variety of cognitive dimensions. Our
group, along with Crutch and colleagues, then expanded
on the previous work and had participants rate 400
nouns (200 abstract & 200 concrete) across an increased
list of dimensions.
These two forays into feature rating approaches
helped to elucidate the representation of abstract concepts, but weaknesses in our approach remained. The
original dimensions of the ACF were biased towards
abstract concepts which lead to an underspecified

representation of concrete concepts in our model. It
was, therefore, necessary for our most recent feature
rating approach (Troche, Crutch, & Reilly, 2017) to
include a greater number of dimensions that could elucidate the representation of concrete and abstract concepts. In the conceptual feature rating (CFR) approach
(the word abstract was removed from the approach
to indicate how this approach focuses on all concepts
not just abstract) participants were asked to rate concepts across a variety of dimensions on a 7 point
Likert scale. We increased the corpus of words to
include not only a greater number of abstract and concrete concepts but also a number of words of middling
concreteness which were not included in our previous
work. This allowed us to create a continuous semantic
space which is closer to the true nature of concepts
as opposed to the bimodal space we had previously
created. The greatest difference between the ACF and
the CFR approach were the dimensions chosen to be
included. We kept the previous dimensions of
Emotion, Polarity, Social Interaction, Thought, Morality,
Time, Space, and Quantity but also included the dimensions of Visual Form, Auditory, Tactile, Olfactory/Gustatory, Visual Colour, and Self-Generated Motion.
We reduced our 14 dimensions using a factor analysis and found that, as with our previous work, the
dimensions reduced into three latent variables representing endogenous information (e.g. emotion,
thought, polarity), exogenous information (e.g. perceptual salience) and magnitude information (e.g. time,
space, quantity). Since the data reduced to three
dimensions, we could successfully plot the ratings in
a three-dimensional space to create a visualisation of
our semantic space. We also ran a cluster analysis to
determine the way the items clustered in our newly
created semantic space. Inspection of this space and
a cluster analysis revealed that each of the latent variables played a distinct role in the representation of
concepts. The exogenous variable was the main
driving factor in separating concepts across concrete
(high exogenous) and abstract (low exogenous) lines.
The endogenous information, however, led to binding
of concepts such that words high in endogenous information were drawn together regardless of their level of
concreteness (e.g. father & chocolate with love & hope).
The magnitude information was found to play a major
role in fine-grained distinctions between concepts such
as HATE and DISLIKE.
The stability of our findings across multiple iterations
of our feature rating approach was indicative of the
reliability of this approach. It was, however, necessary
to formally test the validity of the Conceptual Feature
Rating (CFR) semantic space. We determined we could

test the validity of the semantic space by determining
how well the space could model the relatedness of concepts. In our semantic space, items that are close in distance should be more related. Therefore, participants
performed a word relatedness task in order to determine
if the semantic space could successfully model relatedness. This also involved, however, finding a model for
us to compare to our own. Latent Semantic Analysis
(LSA) another common and well-researched method of
determining word relatedness (Landauer & Dumais,
1997) was considered an ideal method of comparison
due to the similarities in the approach with our own
and the well-documented validity of this approach
(Howard & Kahana, 1999, 2002; Zaromb et al., 2006).
Both LSA and CFR create a multidimensional semantic
space. They also both determine relatedness between
concepts based on the distance between concepts in
their respective space. For LSA, this space metric is
angle cosine while for our space the distance metric is
Euclidean distance.
We compared our space to the LSA space through the
use of the word relatedness task in which participants
were asked to determine which words of a triad were
most related. Associates were either close in the CFR
space or close in the LSA space. Items were also drawn
from the three corners of the semantic space to determine the validity of the entire space and ensure that
one portion of the space was not more valid than
another.

Method
Experiment overview
In this experiment, we tested the validity of CFR semantic
space. We did this by comparing our model to another
common metric (Latent Semantic Analysis; Landauer &
Dumais, 1997) on a word relatedness task. LSA was an
ideal metric with which to compare our semantic space
due to the similarities in their approach with our own
and due to the well documented validity of the LSA
space for determining semantic relatedness (Howard &
Kahana, 1999, 2002; Zaromb et al., 2006).

Participants
Participants (N = 23) were recruited through the LINSLHS participant pool as well as through the community.
Participants were native English speakers, eight of whom
were male. Mean age was 22.61 years (range 18-35);
mean education was 15.52 years (range = 12-20). Participants were compensated either course credit or $10 for
their time.

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

Experiment design
Participants were shown a triad of words as can be seen
in Figure 1. They were asked to determine which of the
two bottom words was most associated or related with
the top word. It has been suggested that the speed
and ease in which such a task is performed is directly
related to the relationship between the associates
(Crutch et al., 2012). The more highly associated the
words are the more quickly, and easily the relationship
can be recognised. The two associated words were
either close in the conceptual feature rating (CFR)
space or close in the LSA space. It is important to recall
that both the CFR and LSA ratings create a semantic
space through which distance metrics describe object
relatedness. Distance in our space is related to the
ratings we gathered on each concept in our original
work. Each word was rated across 14 dimensions and,
therefore, two items would be close in this space if
they were rated similarly across these 14 dimensions.
For the LSA space, distance was determined through
lexical co-occurrence (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). In
other words, the more two words tended to occur in literature the closer they would be in the space. The items
for the triads were drawn from the edges of the semantic
space (i.e. Words high in the endogenous, exogenous, or
magnitude factor). This was done to determine if some
portions of the semantic space were more valid than
others. For the sake of clarity & continuity throughout
the rest of the methods and results the endogenous
factor will be named Factor 1, the exogenous Factor 2
and the magnitude Factor 3.

Materials and procedure
Ninety word triads in total were created. Thirty of the
triads were created with items high in Factor 1, 30 high
in Factor 2, and 30 high in Factor 3. Of those subgroups,
15 were close in our semantic space and 15 were close in
the LSA space.
The relatedness between concepts in our space is
related to their distance. Therefore, the Euclidean distance ((x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2 + (z1 - z2)2) between each
of the words was determined. Items with distances

close to zero were more related than those further from
zero. For LSA, the relatedness between concepts is
related to the cosine of angles and vectors between concepts. Items with cosines closer to 1 are more related than
cosines closer to zero. Cosine values were determined
using the matrix comparison feature of the LSA Boulder,
Colorado website (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). The list of
750 words was input into the matrix comparison
feature, and the output was the cosines between all of
the concepts. To create equivalence across the two relatedness measures, both were subjected to a Blom transformation (Blom, 1958) which is a transformation that
involves inverse ranking the scores and creating a standardised measure. This also placed the variables in a similar
metric. The CFR space scores were then reverse scaled
so that for both scales, higher numbers meant a stronger
relationship between concepts. Due to the transformation
of the data, the scores were no longer distance metrics
but relatedness scores. The higher the relatedness score
the more related the concepts were.
The triads consisted of three items. The probe and
target were highly related to each other while the
probe and distractor item remained somewhat related
but to a lesser extent than the target and probe. Items
were considered highly related if the target and probe
had relatedness scores between 2.75 and 2.0. Distractor
items were deemed related to a lesser extent if their
relatedness to the probe was between 1.5 and 1.0.
Since the Blom transformation is a standardising transformation, these relatedness scores are equivalent to z
scores or standard deviations. In other words, a relatedness score of 2.0 in either metric meant the relatedness
between words was closer than 97.72% of words while
a relatedness score of 1.0 meant the relatedness
between words was closer than 84.13% of words.
The triads were created using the following procedure
to reduce bias in the stimulus selection procedure. First,
the 50 words with the highest ratings per factor were isolated. These 50 words were then placed in a randomised
order. We also created 3 levels of relatedness: 2.75-2.50,
2.49-2.25, 2.24-2.0. Fifteen triads per factor were highly
related in the CFR space while 15 were highly related
in the LSA space; therefore the 15 triads were required
to have 5 items in the 2.75-2.50 range, 5 in the 2.49-
2.25 range, and 5 in the 2.24-2.0 range. These 15 relatedness ranges were also randomised. A visualisation of the
number of items per metric, factor and relatedness range
can be seen in Figure 2. From the randomised list of
words and ranges, the top word and range were
selected. The word with the highest relatedness score
to the probe that was within the relatedness range was
chosen. If the relatedness score between this target
and probe in the current relatedness metric was 1.0

702

greater than the relatedness score in the opposing
metric, it was chosen as the target for that probe word.
If it was not greater than 1.0, then the word with next
highest relatedness score to the probe within the relatedness range was chosen. If none of the words within
that relatedness range were greater than 1.0, then the
next word in the randomised word list would be
chosen until a word within that relatedness range with
a difference greater than 1.0 was found. Once the
target and probe were determined a list of words with
relatedness scores of 1.0-1.5 to the probe were compiled
for the current relatedness metric. This list was compared
to the same list in the other relatedness metric. The
difference between items found on both lists was calculated, and the word with the smallest difference between
metrics was chosen as the distractor. This procedure was
repeated for all factors and relatedness metrics until 90
triads in total were created. A flow chart of the procedure
can be seen in Figure 3.
The triads were well matched across all factors and
relatedness metrics. The average relatedness between
probe and target across factor, metric and factor by
metric can be found in Table 1. The average relatedness
between probe and distractor across factor, metric and
factor by metric can be found in Table 2.
Words in the triads were written in Arial font with a
57 font size all in lowercase. The position of the

distractor and target were pseudorandomized such
that an equal number of targets were displayed on the
left and right. This was done to control for the well documented left looking bias in vision (Altmann, Saleem,
Kendall, Heilman, & Rothi, 2006; Guo, Hall, Hall, Meints,
& Mills, 2007). Items were displayed on a 21-inch
screen with a resolution of 1680 x 1050 using Experiment Centre 3.0 stimulus presentation software from
Sensomotoric Instruments (SMI). Attached to the
monitor was a RED 120 Hz eye tracking unit from Sensomotoric Instruments. This unit along the iViewX 2.0 programme recorded eye movements and pupil size.
Reaction time was also recorded through the iViewX programme based on keyboard button press. Participants
were seated 24 inches from the screen, and they completed a five-point calibration on screen before the
experiment began.
Participants were each read the same instructions
and then completed four practice trials. A trial consisted of a fixation cross followed by a random triad.
The fixation cross was displayed for 5000 ms and the
triad for 10,000 ms for a total trial time of 15,000 ms.
There were 90 trials for a total run time of 22 min
and 30 s. Participants indicated their selection for the
triad using keyboard button press. The triad would
not advance on selection but remain for the entire
10,000 ms stimulus time.

Data analysis
There were four outcome measures: reaction time
revisits to target, total fixations of the target, latency to
peak pupil dilation.

Reaction time
It has been suggested that in odd-one-out tasks or relatedness tasks the length of time taken to complete the
task is a reflection of the ease of which a theme can be
determined amongst the items (Crutch, Connell, & Warrington, 2009). In other words, items that are highly
related will lead to a quicker response than those that
are more distant. The more related the word, the
greater the reduction in reaction time.
Total fixations
In eyetracking, fixation is the point in time when the eye
settles on one point, and a saccade is a quick rapid movement to the next fixation. Increases in total fixations
during a word relatedness task have been suggested to

be indicative of task difficulty. Specifically, when the
relationship between the target and probe becomes
weaker the total number of fixations increases (Noyes,
1980; Phillips, 1981; Rayner, 1998; Rayner & Fisher, 1987).

Total revisits
Revisits are classified as the moment when a fixation
occurs to an area of interest that has already had a
prior fixation. A fixation is only counted as a revisit if
the participant has fixated outside of the area of interest
and has now fixated again inside of the area of interest.
Revisits have been argued to occur in greater frequency
when task difficulty increases (Rayner, 1998).
Latency to peak
Eye movements can be recorded during eyetracking
studies, but pupil size changes (pupillometry) can be
recorded as well. Early work in pupillometry indicated
that the pupil responds to changes in light but also to
changes in arousal (Hess & Polt, 1960). It has also been

704

J. TROCHE

suggested that the pupil responds to changes in cognitive load (Kahneman & Jackson, 1966). While we know
pupil diameter increases as an effect of cognitive load,
there are several variables which represent nuanced
measures of cognitive load. In this study, we examined
latency to peak. Latency to peak, which is the time it
takes for the pupil to reach its max diameter, has been
indicated as a sensitive measure of processing load (Koelewijn, Shinn-Cunningham, Zekveld, & Kramer, 2014; Van
Der Meer et al., 2010; Zekveld, Kramer, & Festen, 2011). As
processing load increases the latency to peak pupil
dilation increases as well.
These four outcomes measures were input into 4
linear mixed effect models using the lme4 package
(Bates & Sarkar, 2006) in the R environment (R Core
Team, 2017). The fixed effects were relatedness metric
which had two levels (CFR; LSA) and factor which had
three levels (Factor1; Factor2; Factor3). We also included
the random effects of subject and item to see if these
improved our model.

Results
Accuracy
Overall, participants correctly responded for 1793 of
2070 trials (86.6%). Accuracies broken down by
factor, metric and factor by metric can be found in
Table 3.

Linear mixed effect models
Four separate Linear Mixed Effect Models were performed for the four outcome measures. Models were
built up first with fixed effects, then by adding random
effects, and finally interactions. The improvement in fit
was determined using chi-square tests on the log-likelihood values (See Table 4). Means and standard errors
for each outcome measure by metric and factor can be
found in Tables 5 and 6.

Reaction time
For RT, the best model included the fixed effects of
metric and factor, as well as the random effects of
subject and item but not factor by metric (Table 4).
There were significant fixed effects of metric [t(6) =

word pairs [t(6) = -3.898, p < .05; Table 7]. Pairwise comparisons using linear mixed effects models with Bonferonni correction revealed that word pairs drawn from
Factor 1 (Table 8) had significantly slower RTs than
both word pairs drawn from Factor 2 [t(6) = -4.288,
p < .05] and Factor 3 [t(6) = -4.403, p < .05].

Total fixations
For total number of target fixations, the best model
included fixed effects for metric and factor but not
factor by metric. The best model also included the
random effects of subject and item (Table 4). There
were significant fixed effects of metric [t(6) = -2.51, p
< .05] and factor [t(6) = -4.241, p < .05]. Fixations for
CFR word pairs were significantly fewer than LSA word
pairs [t(6) = -2.51, p < .05; Table 7]. Pairwise comparisons
using linear mixed effects models with Bonferonni correction revealed that word pairs drawn from Factor 1
(Table 8) had significantly more fixations than both
word pairs drawn from Factor 2 [t(6) = -4.430, p < .05]
and Factor 3 [t(6) = -3.924, p < .05].
Total revisits
For total revisits to target, the best model included fixed
effects for metric and factor but not factor by metric. The
best model also included the random effects of subject
and item (Table 4). There were significant fixed effects of
metric [t(6) = -2.165, p < .05] and factor [t(6) = -2.371,
p < .05]. There were significantly fewer revisits for CFR
word pairs as compared to LSA word pairs [t(6) = -2.165,
p < .05; Table 7]. Pairwise comparisons using linear mixed
effects models with Bonferonni correction revealed that
word pairs drawn from Factor 1 (Table 8) were trending
towards a higher number of revists as compared to pairs
drawn from Factor 2 [t(6) = -2.108, p = .11] and Factor 3
[t(6) = -2.363, p = .08] but this did not reach statistical
significance.
Latency to peak
For latency to peak pupil dilation, the best model
included the fixed effects of metric, factor, as well as
the random effects of subject and item but not factor
by metric (Table 4). There were significant fixed effects
of metric [t(6) = -3.548, p < .05] and factor [t(6) =
-3.144, p < .05]. Latencies to peak for CFR word pairs
were significantly shorter than LSA word pairs [t(6) =
-3.548, p < .05; Table 7]. Pairwise comparisons using
linear mixed effects models with Bonferonni correction
revealed that word pairs drawn from Factor 1 (Table 8)
had significantly longer latencies to peak pupil

Discussion
Outcome variables
The results of our experiment revealed the validity of our
newly created semantic space. For a word relatedness
task our space was better able to model relatedness as
compared to the LSA space. This trend was seen across
all four of our outcome variables. These findings, along
with the fact that the LSA has been consistently found
to be valid in the literature (Howard & Kahana, 1999,
2002; Zaromb et al., 2006), point to the validity of our
space. It should be noted that there were a few limitations in this study.

Concreteness effects
One trend of note in our results was that across our
outcome variables, triads drawn from the Endogenous
space were more difficult and required a greater processing load than triads created from the other two
factors regardless of the space they were drawn from
(i.e. CFR or LSA). Compared to the other areas of the
CFR space, the Endogenous space was more likely to
contain abstract concepts and, therefore, the items

drawn from this space for this experiment were also
more abstract than items drawn from the other
regions. The greater number of abstract items in the
Endogenous region is likely because items high in
emotional/social features are more likely to be abstract
(Kousta et al., 2011), although as we noted in our previous work the endogenous factor did pull concepts
irrespective of their concreteness together (e.g. LOVE;
CHOCOLATE). Because the endogenous items were
more likely to be abstract and since we saw this as
main effect with both spaces (i.e. CFR and LSA) we
interpret this effect of factor as occurring due to the
concreteness effect, the collective advantage of concrete concepts over abstract concepts in a variety of
domains. While some recent work has challenged the
concreteness effect (Kousta et al., 2011), our work and
the vast body of literature indicate the validity of this
effect (Allen & Hulme, 2006; Schwanenflugel, Akin, &
Luh, 1992; Walker & Hulme, 1999).

create a complete theory of semantic memory. The
concreteness effect led researchers to describe concrete and abstract concepts as uniquely distinct
objects and the dominant theory at the moment, the
dual coding theory, postulates that distinct parallel
systems support the representation of abstract and
concrete concepts. In the Conceptual Feature Rating
space, we were able to model concepts in a unified
space. The location and relatedness of the objects in
the space had to do with their overall reliance on
Exogenous information, Endogenous information, and
Magnitude information. Each of these factors played a
distinct role in how the concepts were represented in
the space. The Exogenous information played an
important role in the separation of concepts along concrete and abstract lines. This can be seen as a factor
analogous to imageability. The endogenous information, however, bound concepts regardless of their
level of concreteness. The concepts of LOVE and CHOCOLATE (high in endogenous information) were considered related while MAGNITUDE and CORN (low in
endogenous information) were highly unrelated.
These findings fit well with the assertion that emotion
and other internal states can change the way a
concept is understood and represented (Andrews
et al., 2009; Kousta et al., 2011). Finally, the magnitude
information seemed to play an important role in the
fine-grained distinctions between concepts. For
instance the difference between HATE and DISLIKE.
Overall our space represents a graded view of concreteness which fits well with work that has described concreteness not as a bimodal distribution but as a

continuous distribution (Kousta et al., 2011; Vigliocco
et al., 2013). This finding also represents a paradigm
shift in the way we describe and understand the relationship between abstract and concrete concepts. Previous
work has focused on the differences between abstract
and concrete concepts, but these theories have made
it difficult to understand the relationship between
these concepts in a single semantic memory system.
Our work allows us to not only describe the differences
between abstract and concrete concepts which have
been well documented but also to investigate the way
these concepts interact. This makes it possible to move
past the artificial dichotomy of concrete-abstract and
to describe concepts in a more meaningful way. It is
important to note that this work does not negate previous findings or seminal theories of the differences
between abstract and concrete concepts but it does
allow us to describe and understand the way concepts
interact as part of a larger semantic memory system.
Understanding concepts in this manner will allow us to
move forward in creating better evaluation and treatment techniques for not just concrete but also abstract
concepts as well. We remain with very few evaluation
and treatment options for abstract concepts even
though these concepts are often the most susceptible
to loss and the most important for interpersonal communication (Bonner et al., 2009; Breedin et al., 1994;
Franklin et al., 1995; Jefferies et al., 2009; Warrington,
1975, 1981).
It should be noted that there were a few limitations
for this work. According to a power analysis using the
R package SIMR (Green & MacLeod, 2016), we were
slightly underpowered (N = 23, .63) as a sample size of
28 would be required to reach .80 power. Participants
also had a decent amount of variability in their performance, although running a linear mixed effects model with
random effects for subject and item did account for this
variability in our statistical model.

At this time we remain with a limited amount of ratings
since our previous work contained 750 nouns. Even
though compared to other psycholinguistic databases
this is few ratings; this current work displays that the
original method we used to gather the ratings is valid
in creating a unified semantic space. The method can
be quickly used to scale up the work and include a
greater number of concepts including not just nouns
but possibly verbs as well.
We also cannot, at this time make an assessment as to
whether we are modelling similarity or association or a
combination of both in our semantic space. This

LANGUAGE, COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE

distinction, which has been shown by Crutch and colleagues to be an important distinction in the concreteness literature is an important area of future study.
Future work should also explore the neuroanatomical
framework of the Conceptual Feature Rating space. The
three factors (Endogenous, Exogneous, Magnitude)
seem to map well on to the brain, but none of our previous work can say with certainty where these factors
might live in the brain or how they interact. Work
using functional neuroimaging and lesion models
might help elucidate this question.
Now that we have validated the method used to
gather the ratings, we believe the method itself may
hold value in helping us understand the changes in the
semantic memory system due to certain progressive
neurological diseases. Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, and Parkinson's disease are just a few neurodegenerative diseases
that cause deficits in the semantic memory system, deficits which we still do not completely understand (Grossman et al., 2004; Piatt, Fields, Paolo, Koller, & Troster,
1999; Reilly, Peelle, Antonucci, & Grossman, 2011; Reilly,
Troche, & Grossman, 2011). By allowing individuals with
these diseases to complete the Conceptual Feature
Rating approach and comparing their ratings to agematched controls we may be able to better characterise
the semantic deficits in these disorders. Due to the widespread neuroanatomical nature of the semantic system,
after norming, the conceptual feature rating approach
might hold efficacy as an early diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis. Overall the Conceptual Feature Rating
method and its accompanying data remain an important
foundation for further investigation into the normal functioning of the semantic system as well as understanding
disorders of the semantic system.
