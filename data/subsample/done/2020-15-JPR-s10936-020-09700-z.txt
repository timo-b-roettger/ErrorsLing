Abstract
The importance of phonological awareness (PA) for the acquisition of literacy skills has
been widely recognized. Across languages, PA is commonly examined using the Oddity
test, however, for Chinese-speaking children, Pinyin invented spelling is recommended as
being a more powerful tool to assess PA. However, it is still unclear whether this holds true
for learners of Chinese as a second language (CSL). To address this issue, we administered
an oddity test and a Pinyin invented spelling task to explore Chinese PA in 43 Arabic and
40 English CSL learners at pre-intermediate and intermediate levels. The results generated
two major findings. First, Pinyin invented spelling revealed more significant cross-group
differences in Chinese PA between the Arabic and English CSL learners than the oddity
test. Second, the participants' performance in Pinyin invented spelling was a stronger predictor of character-reading and character-writing skills than their performance in the oddity
test. The overall findings suggest that Pinyin invented spelling may be a more powerful
measurement of Chinese PA for CSL learners in comparison to the conventional test, in
line with the findings reported for Chinese-speaking children. The theoretical implications
for understanding the role of phonological skills in the growth of Chinese literacy skills
and practical suggestions for measuring Chinese PA are proposed.

Introduction
The development of literacy skills is essential for achieving academic success for both
native speakers and second language (L2) learners. Reading and writing are two important types of literacy skills. Reading involves accessing meaning via decoding the printed
words, while writing involves producing printed words via phonological and/or semantic

representation. Although reading and writing are two different cognitive activities, phonological skills are assumed to be essential for the development of competency in both
skills, as seen in different theoretical frameworks, such as the Universal Phonological Principle (Perfetti 2003; Perfetti et al. 1992), the Psycholinguistic Grain Size Theory (Ziegler
and Goswami 2005) and the Obligatory Phonological Mediation Hypothesis in Spelling
(Rapp et al. 1997). For instance, the Universal Phonological Principle claims that "contact
with printed words in any writing system automatically arouses phonological properties
associated with the words" (Perfetti et al. 1992, p. 227). Phonological skills are universally required for reading in any language because correct mapping between phonology
and orthography is essential for the successful decoding of printed words. In addition, the
strong association between phonological processing skills and spelling ability in alphabetic
orthographies has been well documented (Al Mannai and Everatt 2005; Caravolas 2004;
Moll et al. 2014). At the phonological level, phonological awareness (PA), the ability to
perceive and manipulate phonological structure in spoken language, is an essential metalinguistic skill for the development of reading and writing, and it has been investigated by
numerous researchers across different languages.
Various measures, such as the oddity test, syllable or phoneme deletion tasks and
invented spelling tasks have been used to examine PA in English and Chinese (Ding et al.
2014, 2018; Lin et al. 2010; Song et al. 2015; Stanovich et al. 1984; Yopp 1988). In Chinese, Pinyin (an official Roman writing system in Chinese) invented spelling is recommended as a more powerful tool to measure Chinese-speaking children's PA (Ding et al.
2014, 2018; Lin et al. 2010), yet it is unclear whether Pinyin invented spelling is also a
robust tool for investigating PA in learners of Chinese as a second language (CSL). Thus,
the present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of different measures in tapping Chinese PA among CSL learners. Before reporting the details of the experiment, in the following sections we first set out the background to the study, covering relevant research into PA
in Chinese children and CSL learners, in order to identify the research gaps in the field that
this study aims to address.

Chinese Children's Phonological Awareness
Similarly to English PA (Stanovich et al. 1984; Yopp 1988), Chinese children's PA has
been examined using different tasks, such as the oddity test, deletion tasks and Pinyin
invented spelling (Ding et al. 2014, 2018; Lin et al. 2010; Song et al. 2015). These tasks
differ in their ability to tap PA. In comparison to deletion tasks, Pinyin invented spelling
has been recommended as an optimum measure for Chinese PA (Ding et al. 2014, 2018;
Lin et al. 2010) for the following reasons. First, there is evidence that Pinyin invented spelling may be better able to distinguish different literacy competencies. For instance, Ding
et al. (2014) reported that although both Pinyin invented spelling and the deletion task significantly correlated with Chinese character recognition, Pinyin invented spelling was more
powerful for differentiating the poor from the average readers and good readers, and the
average from the good readers, while the deletion task only differentiated the good readers
from the poor readers.
Another crucial reason is that Pinyin invented spelling was found statistically to be a
stronger predictor of Chinese character reading and writing skills than other tasks. It has
been widely acknowledged that PA plays a critical role in the development of reading and
spelling skills in the L1 (Bradley and Bryant 1983; Goswami and Bryant 2016; Hulme and

13

Snowling 2013; Swanson et al. 2003; Ziegler et al. 2010) and the L2 (Keung and Ho 2009;
McBride and Kail 2002; Uchikoshi and Marinova-Todd 2012; Yeung and Chan 2013). PA
significantly correlates with character-reading skills among Chinese-speaking children,
as shown in a meta-analysis study (Song et al. 2015). Studies found that Pinyin invented
spelling outweighs conventional tasks such as deletion tasks in tapping Chinese PA. For
example, Lin et al. (2010) measured Chinese PA using both syllable deletion and Pinyin
invented spelling among 296 kindergarten children. The results showed that, compared to
syllable deletion ( = 0.14), invented Pinyin spelling was a stronger longitudinal predictor of Chinese word-reading ability ( = 0.20). Similarly, Ding et al. (2018) observed that
children's performance in Pinyin invented spelling accounted for a significant amount of
the variance in children's performance in reading characters, but their performance in the
tasks of syllable deletion and phoneme deletion was not a significant predictor in character
reading.
PA is also a significant predictor of spelling in alphabetic languages (Caravolas 2004;
Moll et al. 2014), but findings regarding its contribution to character writing are inconsistent. Using conventional tasks (i.e., deletion tasks and the oddity test) to measure PA,
Yeung et al. (2011) and Liu et al. (2016) found that although PA significantly correlated
with character writing, its predictive power was not significant in the regression model that
included orthographic skills and morphological awareness. Likewise, relying on the task
of Pinyin invented spelling, Wang et al. (2014) did not observe a significant correlation
between PA and character writing. In contrast, Ding et al. (2018) observed that PA measured using deletion tasks did not significantly predict children's performance in character
writing, but children' performance in Pinyin invented spelling significantly explained 5.1%
of the variances in character writing. The unstable relationship between PA and character
writing largely undoubtedly lies in the vagueness of grapheme-phoneme mapping in characters. The transformation from phonological input to orthographic output in writing characters does not depend on the conversion from phoneme to grapheme, because no orthographic unit in characters corresponds to a phonological unit in speech. Thus, the ability
to manipulate the phonological structure of Chinese might not be critical for character
writing. In addition, the tasks administered for investigating PA might be another critical
underlying reason, and more studies are still needed in order to explore this issue further.
As for the reasons underlying the observed advantage of Pinyin invented spelling over
the deletion tasks in measuring Chinese PA, it is assumed that Pinyin invented spelling taps
into Chinese PA at both the segmental (i.e., onset, rime and syllable) and suprasegmental
(i.e., tone) levels. In contrast, deletion tasks only focus on the syllable or phoneme, ignoring the suprasegmental feature. Chinese is a tonal language and the Chinese character is
morphosyllabic, therefore, tone awareness (Hao and Zhou 2019; Li and Ho 2010; McBride
et al. 2008; Siok and Fletcher 2001) and syllable awareness (McBride-Chang et al. 2005;
Shu et al. 2008; Tong 2008) are critical for the recognition of Chinese characters. More
importantly, deletion tasks have been found to be relatively easy for Chinese children to
manipulate, and even struggling readers perform well on deletion tasks (Ding et al. 2014,
2018; Lin et al. 2010), and this may be related to the unique characteristics of the Chinese
language, specifically, that each character corresponds to a syllable and a morpheme. This
means that deleting a syllable from a multisyllabic word or phrase is akin to deleting one
character from a set of characters, which is a common and easy task for Chinese children
(Ding et al. 2014). Furthermore, the structure of Chinese syllables is relatively simple, and
a Chinese syllable has a maximum of four phonemes. Finally, Pinyin learning may help an
individual understand the phonological structure in Chinese and achieve good performance
in PA tasks (Charles et al. 1986; Cheung et al. 2001; McBride-Chang et al. 2004).

The ability of invented spelling to tap into PA has also been documented in earlier studies concerning English speakers (Yopp 1988). Knowledge of phonemes can be assessed
using invented spelling tasks (Tangel and Blachman 1992) and invented spelling may
be a proxy for PA (Mann et al. 1987; McBride and Ho 2005). The significant predictive
power of invented spelling in reading and spelling skills has been found in both concurrent
and longitudinal studies (Mehta et al. 2018; Ouellette and Senechal 2017). Ouellette and
Senechal (2017) contend that invented spelling is not just a mere proxy for PA, but rather
"the analytic processs of invented spelling invokes other cognitive capabilities pertinent to
literacy acquisition and potentially improves the quality of phonological and orthgraphic
representation" (p. 77). These results suggest that invented spelling can be used to explore
meta-linguistic awareness and cognitive skills beyond PA.
Another commonly used task in measuring PA is the oddity test, which is also termed
the odd-man-out task. This test requires participants to detect the odd one out of a set of
three or four items. For instance, to examine onset awareness in English, a set of three
words, "good, guy, fight", could be used, and fight is the odd word because it has a different onset from the other two words. The nature of the oddity test is auditory discrimination, which is one of the least difficult tests for PA and easier than tasks such as blending,
isolation and deletion, and has a weak prediction in word reading skills (Yopp 1988). The
oddity test has also been widely used to examine PA in Chinese children (Huang and Hanley 1995; 1997; Liow and Poon 1998; Shu et al. 2008; Song et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2004).
Similarly to the differences observed between deletion tasks and Pinyin invented spelling, the oddity test concentrates on a specific aspect of the phonological structure, such
as onset, rime, phoneme or tone. Considering the rational underlying the advantage of
Pinyin invented spelling over deletion tasks, it is reasonable to assume that Pinyin invented
spelling might also outperform oddity test in tapping Chinese PA, which yet needs further
empirical evidence.

CSL Learners' Phonological Awareness
Compared with the numerous studies on PA in Chinese-speaking children, research on
CSL learners' PA is scant. In contrast to the various tasks used in studies concerning Chinese-speaking children, measurements to tap CSL learners' PA focus on the oddity test,
and Pinyin invented spelling has not been administered among CSL learners.
Mixed results have emerged from different studies using the oddity test. For instance,
Zhang and Wu (2007) found that the participants' PA was above chance (M = 0.52) after
the first week of the first semester among 25 beginner CSL learners from Indonesia. Similarly, Zhang and Roberts (2019) observed that first-year CSL learners achieved abovechance performance (M = 0.80) in PA among English and Arabic participants. In contrast,
Gao and Gao (2005) found that the participants' accuracy rate in the oddity test was significantly below chance (M = 0.21) among 22 beginning and 16 intermediate CSL learners
with mixed L1 backgrounds. These mixed results might be caused by differences in the
materials used in the oddity tests and the different L1 backgrounds and L2 proficiencies of
the participants across the various studies, and also suggest that more research is needed to
explore the power of the oddity test in exploring CSL learners' PA.
The contribution of PA to the development of CSL learners' literacy skills has also been
examined. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies explored this issue among CSL

13

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2021) 50:375-396

379

learners, yet with different research findings. Using oddity task, Zhang and Roberts (2019)
observed that the total effect of PA on character reading ( = 0.30) and character writing
( = 0.28) was significant among English and Arabic CSL learners at pre-intermediate and
intermediate levels, but the direct effect of PA was only significant on character reading.
In contrast, Hao and Zhou (2019) did not find a significant contribution of PA on character
reading among beginner CSL learners. The task used by Hao and Zhou (2019) was similar
to the oddity test and requires the participants to judge whether the syllables they had heard
included the target onset or rime; a task involving auditory discrimination. However, it is
still unclear whether measuring PA via Pinyin invented spelling influences the results about
the contribution of PA to Chinese literacy skills. Therefore, more studies are necessary
to explore whether measuring PA using different tasks might yield different findings with
regards to the relationship between PA and Chinese literacy skills among CSL learners.
As mentioned above, Pinyin invented spelling has not been used to measure CSL learners' Chinese PA, and has been recommended as an optimum task for exploring Chinese
PA for Chinese children. In addition to the differences in cognitive abilities required and
the comprehensiveness in tapping into Chinese PA between Pinyin invented spelling and
oddity test, the two tasks further differ in the following aspect for CSL learners. CSL learners have acquired one or more languages before learning Chinese, thus the influence of L1
background is unavoidable. The influence of L1 background on oddity test might mainly
happen at the phonological level because the nature of oddity test is auditory discrimination. In contrast, it has been found that CSL learners' performance in Pinyin invented spelling could be influenced by the phonological and orthographic properties in L1 (Hu 2010;
Lin 2009). Thus, it appears safe to assume that Pinyin invented spelling might be also a
more comprehensive and difficult task than oddity test for CSL learners and that Pinyin
invented spelling would be also a powerful task to tap into Chinese PA among CSL learners, an issue the present study aims to address.

The Current Study
The review of research findings on Chinese PA reported above reveal a number of research
gaps. Firstly, previous studies have only compared the power of Pinyin invented spelling
and deletion tasks in tapping into Chinese PA, and the differences between Pinyin invented
spelling and the classical method-oddity test in measuring Chinese PA have not be examined. Secondly, mixed results have been reported on the contribution of PA to character
writing, which warrants further research. Finally, most previous studies focus on Chinesespeaking children, paying little attention to CSL learners. Thus, the current study aims to
explore whether Pinyin invented spelling outperforms conventional oddity test in measuring Chinese PA among CSL learners.
Carrying out such a study among CSL learners is important. First, the fast growing
number of CSL learners around the world and the unique characteristics of Chinese characters have attracted attention from researchers concerning second language acquisition and
more studies are needed to explore the uniqueness of CSL learning. Second, evidence from
CSL learners could deepen our understanding of the influence of different measurements
on researching PA and of the similarities and differences in cognitive processing of Chinese characters among the native Chinese speakers and CSL learners.
The current study selected Arabic and English CSL learners as participants mainly
because of the unique characteristics of phonological and orthographic properties across

13

380

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2021) 50:375-396

Chinese, English and Arabic. In terms of vowels, Chinese has 10 short vowels and four
diphthongs; English has seven short vowels, five long vowels, and eight diphthongs; and
Arabic has three short vowels and three long vowels. With regard to consonants, Chinese
has 22 consonants, English has 24 and Arabic has 28. Chinese has four tones, yet neither
English nor Arabic has tones. More importantly, Chinese Pinyin and English utilize the
same Roman writing system, which differs greatly from the Arabic writing system. Thus,
Chinese Pinyin and English are more similar in terms of phonological and orthographic
properties than Chinese Pinyin and Arabic.
The differences and similarities between the three languages might lead to differences in
performance between the English and Arabic CSL learners' in Chinese PA. Previous studies have found the influence of L1 background on both PA (Durgunolu et al. 1993) and
spelling (Figueredo 2006) tasks. In particular, Arabic ESL learners performed less well
in tasks involving vowel manipulation in English than their counterparts whose L1s have
a rich repertoire of vowels (Ryan and Meara 1991; Saigh and Schmitt 2012) and in the
spelling of vowels (Thompson and Thomas 1983; Saigh and Schmitt 2012) and some consonants in English words (Allaith 2009; Allaith and Joshi 2011; Ibrahim 1978). Considering the comparisons between the three languages and the above findings, it may be that the
English CSL learners outperform their Arabic counterparts in Chinese PA.
There are two research questions addressed by the current study.
RQ 1Whether cross-group differences in Chinese PA between Arabic and English CSL
learners vary between the oddity task and the Pinyin invented spelling task?

Hypothesis 1 It was hypothesized that the English CSL group would outperform the Ara-

bic group in Chinese PA, especially for rimes which are composed mainly of vowels, and
that Pinyin invented spelling would reveal more cross-group differences between the Arabic and English groups.
RQ 2Whether the contribution of PA to character reading and character writing skills
differs between the oddity test and the Pinyin invented spelling task

Hypothesis 2 It was hypothesized that PA measured via Pinyin invented spelling would
contribute more to character reading and writing than that measured via oddity test.

Material and Methods
Participants
The 83 L2 participants comprised two groups, English and Arabic learners of Chinese as
a second language, all living in their native countries (the UK or Egypt) and studying Chinese as a major subject at university (Table 1). The participants were recruited from among
2nd-year and 3rd-year learners. The 3rd-year English group studied in China for about one
year due to the requirement of course policy in the UK and some participants in 2nd-year
English group stayed in China for some time due to tourism or volunteer work or other reasons. However, the Arabic groups did not have such experience.

As described above, the Arabic and English groups differed in learning contexts and
length of staying in China, therefore, to make sure the they were comparable in global
CSL proficiency, the participants' CSL proficiency was examined using the standardized
HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) test. There has been no consensus about the most suitable
test to examine CSL learners' proficiency. According to Zhang (2018), HSK is recommended as a powerful Chinese proficiency test. A simplified version of HSK test designed
by Zhang (2018) was administered in the present study, including listening and reading
comprehension. Speaking and writing section were excluded mainly due to the time limit.
Nonetheless, Zhang (2018) claims that this simplified HSK test was valid in investigating
CSL learners' overall proficiency to some extent. There were eight questions in each section, which were randomly selected from HSK level 3 and HSK level 4, corresponding to
pre-intermediate and intermediate levels, respectively, according to the syllabus of HSK
test.1 It was administered in a paper-and-pencil format and took approximately 20 min.
One score was assigned to a correct answer and zero to an incorrect or unanswered item.
The maximum score was 16, and the Cronbach's alpha reliability was 0.80. The Arabic and
English groups did not differ significantly in terms of their overall scores, and the effect
size was small,2 t(81) = 1.27, p = 0.21, Cohen's d = 0.28, Hedge's g = 0.28. The results suggest that the two groups were comparable in overall Chinese language proficiency irrespective of their different background and experiences.

Measures
The Oddity test
There is not yet a standardized test for Chinese PA, and questionnaires used to test PA in
L2 Chinese are not available. Thus, an oddity test based on the comparison of the phonological properties of Arabic, Chinese and English was developed. The test comprised four
subtests on syllable, onset, rime and tone awareness, with eight questions for each subtest.
A subtest for phoneme awareness was not included because it is not a salient psycholinguistic grain size for Chinese reading (Li et al. 2012).
The oddity test was administered in the form of a paper-and-pencil task. For each subtest, the participants were required to listen to a set of three items and then to detect the
odd one out. Disyllabic words were used for syllable awareness and single-syllable words
for onset, rime and tone awareness. For example, among "po, bng, p", the odd word was

The present study adopts the criteria for effect size proposed by Cohen (1988) and Cohen's benchmarks
are .40 = small, .70 = medium and 1.00 = big.

"bng". All the stimuli were selected from The Graded Chinese Syllables, Characters and
Words for the Application of Teaching Chinese to the Speakers of Other Languages (The
State Language Affairs Commission 2010) and were recorded by an adult female native
Chinese speaker in a professional sound-proof language laboratory. The audio recording
was played only once and the participants had five seconds to answer each question. The
accuracy rate on each subtest was calculated by dividing the number of correct answers by
8. The Cronbach's alpha reliability of the oddity test was 0.72.

Pinyin Invented Spelling
A list of 15 pseudo disyllable words was used for the Pinyin spelling task. The selected
syllables covered most of the onsets and rimes in Chinese. The distribution of the four
tones was balanced across the disyllables. The participants were required to write down
the disyllable words in Pinyin after hearing the stimulus twice and had ten seconds to write
each one. The timing limit of 10 s was adopted according to the results of a polit study,
in which 90% of the participants (n = 10) were able to write down the disyllables within
ten seconds. All the stimuli were recorded by an adult female native Chinese speaker in a
professional sound-proof language laboratory. The task was administered in the form of a
paper-and-pencil task. The Cronbach's alpha reliability of the Pinyin invented spelling task
was 0.87.
The scoring of syllable spelling focused on the accuracy of the spelling of the 30 single
syllables. One point was assigned to a correctly spelled syllable, and a score of zero was
assigned to a syllable with error(s) in onset, rhyme or tone. The scoring of the onset, rhyme
and tone spelling focused on the individual unit. For instance, to calculate the accuracy
rate for onset spelling, one point was assigned if the onset of one syllable was correct,
regardless of whether there were errors in rhyme or tone. The accuracy rate for the syllable,
onset, rhyme and tone was calculated by dividing the number of correct responses by 30.

Character Reading and Writing Tests
The tests for character reading and writing tests were adopted from Zhang and Roberts
(2019). The character reading test included 108 characters, which were balanced according
to difficulty, stroke number, frequency and phonetic regularity. The 108 characters were set
out on one A4 sheet of paper from high to low frequency. The task asked the participants
to read the displayed characters aloud. If they did not know, they were required to say "I
don't know'. The test stopped if the participant made five errors or did not respond to five
characters in a row in this study, following Zhang and Roberts (2019). There was a 3 min
time limit on the task. A score of one was assigned if the syllable was pronounced correct,
and zero if the pronounced syllable was wrong or missed. Tone was not analyzed because
of its difficulty, which is also a common practice in CSL research. The Cronbach's alpha
reliability of character reading was 0.93.
The character writing test included 24 target characters, which were also balanced in
difficulty, stroke number, frequency and phonetic regularity. This task was administered
using a paper-and-pencil test. The task was to write the target character according to the
pronunciation and translated meaning of the displayed words. The Pinyin of the target
character was printed in bold and italic. For instance, the target character for "du lai le (all
came)"is. A score of one was assigned to a correct answer, and zero to a wrong answer
or unanswered item. The Cronbach's alpha reliability of character writing was 0.80.

The LLAMA Test
To control for the participants' language-learning aptitude, in particular their phonological working memory (PWM) and phonetic coding ability (PCA), sections D and E of the
LLAMA tests were administered (Meara 2005). LLAMA tests have been used in previous
studies (Bokander and Bylund 2019; Granena 2013, 2018; Granena and Long 2013; Xiang
et al. 2012; Yi 2018), and have showed good reliability and validity. In addition, LLAMA
software is compatible with laptops, and it is convenient for administering. For instance,
the scores of each section were displayed automatically after the participants finished the
tests. Moreover, LLAMA tests are easily accessible as they could be downloaded and used
free of charge.
Section D of the LLAMA test is a sound recognition task that tests PWM, and includes
two phases. In the learning phase, the participants first heard a string of 10 words spoken
in an artificial language, and they were asked to remember these words. In the test phase,
the participants heard another string of words including the 10 words they had heard before
in the learning phase and 20 words they had not heard before. The participants were tasked
with distinguishing the words they had learned and those they had not after hearing the
words one by one.
Section E is a sound-symbol correspondence task that tests PCA. There were two phases
in this section. In the learning phase, the participants had 2 min to learn the sound-symbol
correspondence rules of an artificial language. A list of 24 spellings in an artificial writing system was then displayed on the screen. The participants were required to click each
spelling to hear the sounds and to determine how these spellings correspond to the sounds
in the artificial language. In the test phase, the participants first heard a word and then saw
two possible spellings on the screen, and they were required to select the correct spelling.
There were 21 items in the test phase.
Both the Section D and E of LLAMA tests were administered on a laptop. Although the
LLAMA test manual did not mention time limit for both sections, all the participants completed section D within 10 min and Section E within 15 min.

Procedure
All participants were given an informed consent form, informing them of the aim and the
main tasks in the study, printed in their native languages, Arabic or English. The participants completed the tasks in the following order to prevent potential priming effects: the
LLAMA test, the oddity test, Pinyin invented spelling and HSK tests, and then the background information questionnaire. All the participants were tested individually, and were
paid for their participation after completing the test. Most participants completed the four
measures within 40 min.

RQ 1: The Effect of the Oddity Test and Pinyin Invented Spelling
on CrossGroup Differences
The first research question concerns whether Pinyin invented spelling reveals more crossgroup differences between Arabic and English CSL learners than the oddity test. To answer
this question, a series of independent samples t tests were carried out for the oddity test and
Pinyin invented spelling task between the English and Arabic groups. The results are summarized in Table 3.
For the oddity test, the Arabic and English groups differed significantly only in syllable
discrimination and onset discrimination. The effect sizes for both groups were large, and
the English outperformed the Arabic group in syllable and onset discrimination. The two
groups did not differ significantly in rime or tone discrimination.
For the Pinyin invented spelling task, significant cross-group differences were observed
in syllable, onset and rime spelling, and the effect sizes range from medium to large. The
English group outperformed the Arabic group in syllable, onset and rime spelling. The two
groups did not differ significantly in tone spelling.

RQ 2: The Effect of the Oddity Test and Pinyin Invented Spelling
on Character Literacy Skills
The second research question is whether Pinyin invented spelling contributes more to character reading and character writing skills than the oddity test. Correlation, multiple regression and path analyses were carried out to investigate this question. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were conducted to provide evidence for the path analysis.

Multiple Regression
The average of the scores for syllable, onset, rime and tone awareness represented the overall performance on the oddity test. The syllable spelling accuracy was considered to represent the overall performance on the Pinyin invented spelling task because it took onset,
rime and tone into account.
The correlation matrix between measured variables and the results of the multiple
regression analyses are summarized in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The VIF indexes of the

two multiple regressions indicate that high multicollinearity does not exist. Pinyin invented
spelling significantly predicted the participants' character-reading and character-writing
performance, and the L1 background was a significant predictor of character writing, both
with large effect sizes. The oddity test did not significantly predict either character reading
or character writing, and its effect sizes were very small.

Path Analysis
To further investigate the relations of the oddity test and Pinyin invented spelling with
character literacy skills among the CSL learners, path analysis was carried out using
AMOS 23.0.
Path analysis is confirmatory and should be theory- or evidence-based. However, there
is no available theoretical framework for our research questions; thus, the selection of the
variables and paths in the model was mainly based on the correlation matrix between the
measured variables (Table 4) and the results of multiple regression analysis (Table 5).
PCA did not significantly correlate with character writing in the correlation matrix or
predict character writing in the multiple regression analysis, thus the path from PCA to
character writing was not depicted in the path analysis. Age and length of stay in China
did not correlate with either the oddity test, Pinyin invented spelling, character reading or
writing; thus, the two variables were excluded from path analysis. Gender, L1, PCA and
PWM are the participants' background and meta-cognitive variables, and they are assumed
to contribute to participants' performance on the oddity test and Pinyin invented spelling
task, which in turn contribute to character reading and writing. Considering the consensus
on the role of PA in spelling skills, a direct path from the oddity test to Pinyin invented
spelling was added. Based on the strong relationship between character reading and writing
in the correlation matrix and the possible contribution of reading to writing, a direct effect
of reading on writing was depicted (Fig. 1). This model shows adequate goodness-of-fit
indices (Table 6).
As shown in Table 7, the total effects of Pinyin invented spelling on character reading
and writing were significant, as were the total effects of oddity test on character reading
and character writing. However, the direct effect of Pinyin invented spelling on character
reading was significant, and its direct effect on character writing was marginally significant. In contrast, the direct path from oddity test to character reading or character writing
was not significant. The indirect effects of oddity test on character reading and character
writing were significant, as was the indirect effect of Pinyin invented spelling on character
writing.

Discussion
The present study compared the power of two different measures, the oddity test vs. Pinyin
invented spelling, for exploring Chinese PA in English and Arabic CSL learners. Two main
findings emerged. Firstly, it was found that Pinyin invented spelling uncovered more crossgroup differences in PA than the oddity test among the two CSL groups. Secondly, Pinyin
invented spelling, rather than the oddity test, significantly predicted character-reading and
character-writing skills. The overall results suggest that Pinyin invented spelling is a more
robust tool than the oddity test for exploring PA in CSL learners.

The Effect of the Oddity Test and Pinyin Invented Spelling
on CrossGroup Differences
In the current study, Pinyin invented spelling appears to be better able to uncover the crossgroup differences among English and Arabic CSL learners. In line with our hypothesis,
the English outperformed the Arabic group in Chinese PA as measured using the oddity
test and the Pinyin invented spelling task. Although the effect size of L1 background on
syllable discrimination was larger than that on syllable spelling, the effect sizes of L1 background on onset spelling and rime spelling were larger than those on onset and rime discrimination. More importantly, the two groups' differences in rime discrimination was not
statistically significant, in contrast to those for rime spelling. These findings align with previous research that has observed poorer performance in vowel perception or manipulation
by Arabic ESL learners (Ryan and Meara 1991; Saigh and Schmitt 2012; Thompson and
Thomas 1983). The major reason for this result may relate to the cognitive loads required
for the two different tasks.
On the oddity test, perception skills and short-term working memory are essential for
detecting the odd one out of the three items (Yopp 1988). Our CSL participants were educated university students and possessed fully-fledged perception skills and working memory; therefore, the oddity test might be a relatively easy task for them. In fact, we also

administered the oddity test to a group of native Arabic speakers and a group of native
English speakers who did not have any experience with learning Chinese. The results
showed that the two groups' overall performance on the oddity test was above the chance
level: Arabic (syllable = 0.57, SD = 0.18; onset = 0.65, SD = 0.12; rime = 0.67, SD = 0.17;
tone = 0.83, SD = 0.24; mean = 0.68, SD = 0.11), t(42) = 10.73, p < 0.0001; English (syllable = 0.70, SD = 0.16; onset = 0.78, SD = 0.11; rime = 0.70, SD = 0.10; tone = 0.93,
SD = 0.10; mean = 0.78, SD = 0.06), t(39) = 10.73, p < 0.0001. This finding is similar to
struggling Chinese children's fairly good PA performance as measured by syllable deletion
and phoneme deletion (Ding et al. 2014). In addition, the subtest of oddity test focuses on a
specific component of Chinese syllables, such as onset, rime or tone. These results suggest
that the oddity test is an easy task for adult CSL learners because of their cognitive maturity and ample experience with language learning.
Unlike the oddity test, both perception and production skills are required for the Pinyin
invented spelling task. In addition to correct perception of the syllable structure, the Pinyin
invented spelling task involves the transition from phonological processing to orthographic
processing, in which awareness of and the ability to master the phonology-orthography

13

390

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2021) 50:375-396

correspondence play an important role (Tainturier and Rapp 2001). Moreover, the Pinyin
invented spelling task requires the participants to concentrate on onset, rime and tone
simultaneously (Ding et al. 2014, 2018; Lin et al. 2010). More importantly, the task of
Pinyin invented spelling requires the production of orthographic representations of Chinese
Pinyin. Pinyin utilizes the same Roman writing system as English, which is very likely to
put the English group at an advantage and the Arabic group at a disadvantage. To sum,
Pinyin invented spelling is a more comprehensive and difficult task that imposes a greater
cognitive load than the oddity test for adult CSL learners, and might invoke other cognitive
abilities pertinent to literacy acquisition beyond PA such as orthographic processing skills
(Ouellette and Senechal 2017).

The Effect of the Oddity Test and Pinyin Invented Spelling on Character
Literacy Skills
The finding that the effects of PA measured via the oddity test and Pinyin invented spelling on character reading and character writing were significant is in accord with theories
such as Universal Phonological Principle (Perfetti 2003), the Psycholinguistic Grain Size
Theory (Ziegler and Goswami 2005) and the Obligatory Phonological Mediation Hypothesis in Spelling (Rapp et al. 1997), as well as with the results of previous studies in Chinese children (Ding et al. 2014, 2018; Lin et al. 2010; Song et al. 2015) and CSL learners
(Zhang and Roberts 2019). Additionally, Pinyin invented spelling appears to be a much
stronger predictor than the oddity test, as seen in the results of multiple regression analysis
and path analysis, and the results are in line with previous studies (Ding et al. 2014, 2018;
Lin et al. 2010). There are three possible reasons accounting for the relatively stronger
effect of Pinyin invented spelling on character literacy skills.
Firstly, the Pinyin invented spelling task suits the unique characteristics of Chinese language. Chinese is a morphosyllabic and tonal language, thus the ideal measurement of Chinese PA should be comprehensive and tap an individual's abilities to manipulate at the
syllable, onset, rime and tone levels. Traditional tasks such as syllable deletion, phoneme
deletion or oddity tests concentrate on a specific aspect rather than the holistic structure of
Chinese phonology. The task of Pinyin invented spelling moves beyond the level of syllable and phoneme awareness and examines the awareness of phonological structure, and
corresponds to the features of Chinese as a syllable-based and tonal language (Ding et al.
2018).
Secondly, Pinyin is used as an aid for learning characters. For both CSL learners and
Chinese-speaking children, introduction to Pinyin routinely appears prior to the introduction of characters in classroom practice and textbooks. Pinyin is mainly used to represent
the pronunciation of Chinese characters because transparent phonological clues are not
available in the orthographic units of the characters. More importantly, Pinyin normally
appears above or near each character in the textbooks or dictionaries, and character writing
skills are normally examined by asking the learners to write out characters according to the
displayed Pinyin or vice versa, these practices might reinforce the mapping between Pinyin
and Chinese character reading and writing (Ding et al. 2018). Therefore, mastery of Pinyin
may greatly boost CSL learners' confidence and ability to learn new characters.
Pinyin learning might be particularly useful for the acquisition of Chinese literacy
skills for CSL learners speaking alphabetic L1s, because they rely heavily on phonological skills to achieve success in character learning (Everson 1998; Jiang 2003).

13

Journal of Psycholinguistic Research (2021) 50:375-396

391

Everson (1998) and Jiang (2003) found a strong correlation between knowing pronunciation and knowing meaning among CSL learners speaking alphabetic L1s, rather
than their counterparts with Chinese-character background such as Korean and Japanese CSL learners. These findings are similar to those reported in ESL learners who
speak alphabetic L1s rely more on phonological information in English word naming
in comparison to those speaking non-alphabetic L1s (Brown and Haynes 1985; Koda
1988; 1989; Zhao 2011).
Thirdly, Pinyin learning may enhance the development of PA. The benefit of learning Pinyin for improving PA has been observed in studies of Chinese-speaking children (Cheung et al. 2001; McBride-Chang et al. 2004; Ren et al. 2006; Shu et al.
2008). Lin et al. (2010) argued that Pinyin practice helps Chinese children manipulate
the phonological units of Chinese syllables in both top-to-bottom (such as by segmenting a Pinyin syllable into its onset and rime) and bottom-to-top (such as by combining
an onset and rime into a Pinyin syllable) ways, which in turn strengthens the children's
sensitivity and ability to manipulate the structure of Chinese syllables.
It has been further observed that the effect of Pinyin invented spelling on character writing was mediated by character reading, aligning with the finding reported by
Zhang and Roberts (2019). An individual can successfully write a Chinese character
without knowing its pronunciation, and the independent role of orthographic processing in character writing has been observed in previous research (Han et al. 2007; Law
et al. 2005; Zhang and Wang 2016). The mediation effect of character reading on the
relationship between Pinyin invented spelling and character writing might be due to
the strong correlation between Pinyin invented spelling and character reading, which
in turn significantly predicts character writing. The significant contribution of Pinyin
knowledge or Pinyin invented spelling to Chinese character reading and the significant
prediction of character reading in character writing have been found in studies involving Chinese children (Ding et al. 2014, 2018; Lin et al. 2010; Siok and Fletcher 2001).
Additionally, reading intervention might facilitate the development of spelling skills,
with its beneficial effect being maintained over time (Graham et al. 2017). Therefore, it seems reasonable that character reading bridges the effect of Pinyin invented
spelling on character writing, but more research is needed to explore the underlying
mechanism.
This study has several theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, the
overall findings provide evidence from CSL learners for the theories that argue for the
contribution of phonological skills to the growth of literacy skills across different languages, such as Universal Phonological Principle (Perfetti 2003), the Psycholinguistic Grain Size Theory (Ziegler and Goswami 2005) and the Obligatory Phonological
Mediation Hypothesis in Spelling (Rapp et al. 1997). Moreover, the present study confirms the close relationship between reading and writing, and, in particular, the facilitating effect of reading on writing might be universal across different languages (Ding
et al. 2018; Graham et al. 2017). From a practical perspective, the results of this study
demonstrate that different tasks differ in the power to tap PA (Stanovich et al. 1984;
Yopp 1988). Also, it provides further support for the proposed advantage of Pinyin
invented spelling over conventional tasks such as deletion tasks or oddity test among
Chinese children (Ding et al. 2014, 2018; Lin et al. 2010). The results imply that
researchers and instructors are recommended to use Pinyin invented spelling alongside
the conventional measurements to measure Chinese PA among native Chinese speakers
and CSL learners.

Limitations
We are aware of a number of limitations in the present study. Firstly, using tasks such
as syllable deletion or phoneme deletion alongside oddity tests and Pinyin invented
spelling might have led to a deeper understanding of the influence of different tasks
on the measurements of Chinese PA. Secondly, the total score, timing limit and the
times played for each item in oddity test and Pinyin invented spelling differed, which
might lead to the different reliabilities of each test and further influence the research
findings. Thirdly, only English and Arabic CSL learners were recruited for the present
study, and they were studying Chinese in a Chinese-as-a-foreign-language context; thus,
whether the findings can be generalized to CSL learners speaking other languages or
in a Chinese-as-a-second-language context should be researched further. Also, the two
CSL groups differed in the length of stay in China and learning contexts, which might
interact with L1 background in influencing the research findings. Future research could
recruit participants with more homogeneous characteristics and experience. Finally, our
study recruited only 83 CSL participants, and the samples might not be suitable for path
analysis, which requires large sample sizes (Klein 2010; Stage et al. 2004). Although
the present study is limited in several ways, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to explore the influence of different tasks on the measurement of PA among CSL
learners. The results are of theoretical and practical significance, and shed light on our
understanding of how findings might differ depending on the assessments administered
and of the role PA plays in the acquisition of Chinese literacy skills.
