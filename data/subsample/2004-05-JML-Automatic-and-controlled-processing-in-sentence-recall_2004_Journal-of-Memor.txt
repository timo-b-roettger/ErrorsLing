Abstract
Immediate serial recall is better for sentences than word lists presumably because of the additional support that
meaningful material receives from long-term memory. This may occur automatically, without the involvement of attention, or may require additional attentionally demanding processing. For example, the episodic buffer model (Baddeley,
2000) proposes that the executive component of working memory plays a crucial role in the formation of links between
different representational formats and previously unrelated concepts. This controlled integrative encoding may be more
important in sentence than word recall. Three experiments examined the effect of an attention-demanding concurrent
visual choice reaction time task on the recall of auditorily presented stories, sentences, and lists of unrelated words, in
order to investigate the relative importance of automatic and controlled processing for these materials. The concurrent
task was found to disrupt the recall of strings of unrelated sentences more than random word lists, suggesting that controlled processing played a greater role in the sentence recall task. On subsequent learning trials, however, recall of the
unrelated words was also disrupted by the concurrent task, possibly due to the development of chunking. The large dual
task decrement for unrelated sentences did not generalise to the recall of more naturalistic prose, suggesting that the
requirement to integrate phonological with long-term linguistic information is not attentionally demanding per se;
instead, the integration of unrelated concepts is effortful once recall extends beyond the capacity of the phonological
loop. Our results suggest that sentence recall reflects contributions from both automatic linguistic processes and attentionally limited working memory.

memory (STM) and those with the classic amnesic syndrome. Amnesic patients are severely impaired on
long-term prose recall tasks such as the logical memory
test but have intact digit span (Baddeley & Warrington,
1970; Milner, 1966). Conversely, STM patients have
greatly reduced digit span in the context of relatively intact delayed prose recall (Shallice & Warrington, 1970;
Vallar & Shallice, 1990). In the original working memory (WM) model of Baddeley and Hitch (1974), span

for verbal materials was assumed to be limited by the
time-based capacity of the phonological loop, operating
independently from long-term memory (LTM). However, more recent research has emphasised the extent
to which the two systems work together. Phonological
STM is thought to play a crucial role in learning longterm phonological representations of new words
(Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, 1998; Baddeley,
Papagno, & Vallar, 1988; Gathercole & Baddeley,
1989, 1990a, 1990b), and LTM can also contribute to
performance on span tasks, with higher spans possible
when the contribution from LTM is greater (e.g.,
Hulme, Maughan, & Brown, 1991). The difference between word and sentence span provides a particularly
clear example of this: twice as many words can be recalled in the correct order when they form a meaningful
sentence (Brener, 1940).
Different levels of long-term knowledge (sub-lexical,
lexical, and super-lexical) contribute to performance on
immediate serial recall tasks. At the sub-lexical level,
word-like nonwords, containing sequences of phonemes
that occur frequently in real words, are repeated more
accurately than nonwords that are less word-like (Gathercole, Frankish, Pickering, & Peaker, 1999). At the lexical level, LTM representations of the sounds and
meanings of familiar words make an important contribution to word span. Span is higher for words than
for nonwords (Hulme et al., 1991), and higher for
words that frequently occur in English compared with
less frequent words (Hulme et al., 1997). In addition,
span is greater for high compared with low imageability
words (Bourassa & Besner, 1994), for concrete compared with abstract words (Walker & Hulme, 1999),
and for words taken from the same semantic category
(Poirier & Saint Aubin, 1995). Neuropsychological evidence also points to the role of lexical-level representations in span tasks (see Martin & Saffran, 1997; Martin
& Lesch, 1996; Martin, Shelton, & Yaffee, 1994).
Semantic dementia patients, who show a specific and
progressive decline in semantic memory, are better at
repeating words that they understand relatively well
compared with words whose meanings have become degraded over the course of the disease (Jefferies, Jones,
Bateman, & Lambon Ralph, in press; Jefferies, Jones,
Bateman, & Lambon Ralph, 2004; Knott, Patterson,
& Hodges, 1997; Patterson, Graham, & Hodges, 1994).
Sentence span is substantially greater than word span
(Brener, 1940), reflecting the involvement of long-term
representations above the lexical level in span tasks. Miller and Selfridge (1950) studied the recall of word sequences with different degrees of approximation to
English prose. Higher order approximations were more
meaningful and more grammatical, and resulted in better
recall, suggesting that both syntactic and semantic factors
may play a role in increasing sentence span above word
span. Epstein (1961) found that grammatically marked se-

quences of nonsense syllables and unrelated words were
easier to recall than sequences that were not tagged in this
way. Similarly, Marks and Miller (1964) found that
Oanomalous sentencesO that were grammatically correct
but had little overall meaning (e.g., ONoisy flashes emit
careful floodsO) were recalled more accurately than jumbled anomalous sentences with a random word order.
The semantic relationships between words can also
influence immediate serial recall. Baddeley and Levy
(1971) found a semantic similarity effect in the recall of
meaningful noun-adjective pairs, so that sequences like
Opriest-moral, minister-religious, vicar-piousO were recalled more poorly than sequences like Opalace-magnificent, apple-delicious, rattlesnake-deadly.O This semantic
similarity effect disappeared when the nouns and adjectives were not semantically compatible, presumably because this caused the participants to fall back onto
phonological coding. Finally, if participants are given
information about the overall theme of a passage of
prose in the form of a title or a picture, recall improves
considerably (Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Dooling &
Lachman, 1971).
A number of theories have been proposed to account
for the difference between word and sentence span. They
make the common assumption that sentence span is
higher than word span because it derives additional support from long-term representations that are involved in
sentence comprehension. Sentence recall is constrained
not only by lexical-level representations but also by syntactic and semantic representations of the theme or overall meaning of the sentence. These syntactic and
semantic factors increase the predictability of words in
a sentence and may enhance memory in a process akin
to chunking (Miller, 1956). In addition, Potter and Lombardi suggested that the surface structure of sentences
could be reconstructed from long-term conceptual, lexical, and syntactic representations that were activated
during the processing of the sentence (Lombardi & Potter, 1992; Potter & Lombardi, 1990, 1998).
While there is general agreement that semantic and
syntactic constraints will aid sentence retrieval, there is
less agreement about their role in encoding. One possibility is that sentences activate semantic and syntactic
representations relatively automatically as they are processed and this activation enhances sentence retrieval
consequentially. This type of support for sentences is
envisaged by connectionist models that view verbal
STM as arising directly from the representations that
underpin language processing (MacDonald & Christiansen, 2002; Martin & Saffran, 1997). Alternatively, executive resources may play a necessary role in integrating
phonological, lexical, syntactic, and semantic representations in sentence span tasks, enabling sentence span to
extend far beyond the limited capacity of the phonological loop. Baddeley (2000), for example, proposed that
immediate prose recall depends on the episodic buffer

E. Jefferies et al. / Journal of Memory and Language 51 (2004) 623-643

component of WM: this is envisaged as an attentionally
limited temporary store, capable of integrating information from multiple sources into a single episode. Baddeley and Wilson (2002) used the concept of an episodic
buffer to explain marked individual differences in the
immediate recall of prose by amnesic patients. A subset
of patients who showed good immediate prose recall
proved to have well preserved executive and intellectual
capacity, suggesting to Baddeley and Wilson that they
may have been able to utilise the attentionally limited
episodic buffer system as a basis for immediate recall.
A similar distinction between automatic and attentiondemanding LTM support for WM has been suggested by
several other researchers. Engle, Kane, and Tuholski
(1999) proposed that WM performance is accounted for
by automatic activation of LTM and the capacity for
``controlled attention.'' These aspects of WM appear to
interact: individuals with superior performance on complex span tasks, which make simultaneous storage and
processing demands, show a greater benefit of domainspecific knowledge in their recall of baseball commentaries (Hambrick & Engle, 2002). This pattern is consistent
with the notion that individuals with greater attentional
capacity can more readily utilise information in LTM to
support recall. Similarly, CowanOs (1995) ``embedded processes'' model of WM distinguishes between information
in LTM, the activated portion of LTM, and the subset of
this activation that is in the focus of attention. Attention is
proposed to play a role in forming new links between disparate representations in LTM; therefore, attention-demanding binding may enable sentence span to extend
beyond the recall of unrelated words by facilitating the
integration of different levels of linguistic knowledge
and/or the various propositions within a sentence. Connections may also be established between activated representations that are not within the focus of attention,
allowing more automatic support for sentence span (see
Cowan, 1999). These two theories make similar predictions to those of the episodic buffer model (Baddeley,
2000), without positing a separate integrative store.
Another relevant perspective is Ericsson and KintschOs (1995) long-term working memory (LT-WM) theory. According to this viewpoint, there is a recall
advantage for meaningful material that occurs because
this information can be rapidly integrated with pre-existing structures in LTM. These remain readily accessible if
aspects of the information are successfully maintained in
STM. Consequently, LTM can act as an extension of
WM (LT-WM). In some circumstances, the creation of
these retrieval structures is likely to be attention
demanding; for instance, with practice, subjects can dramatically improve their digit spans by associating
groups of digits to pre-existing knowledge in a deliberate
and apparently effortful way (e.g., encoding digits as
running times for races: Chase & Ericsson, 1981). If
the construction of mental models during sentence com-

625

prehension is analogous to this process, sentence span
tasks should rely on attention. It should be noted, however, that Ericsson and Kintsch themselves did not focus
on the role of attention and it is not clear if retrieval
structures are always effortful to construct.
These theories might predict that normal participants
should show a larger detrimental effect of divided
attention on tasks that draw heavily on prior knowledge.
Britton and Tesser (1982) observed this pattern in participantsO reaction times on a secondary task. Knowledge
about the primary task was manipulated by presenting
additional information (for example, the previous page
of text in a reading task) or by selecting novices and experts within a particular domain. Likewise, prose recall
should be impaired to a greater extent than recall of an
unstructured word list by an attentionally demanding secondary task during encoding. One study examined retention of a prose passage under dual-task conditions
(Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). Memory for prose was found
to be more impaired when participants had to remember
sequences of six digits simultaneously, compared with a
load of three digits, or with repeating single digits. Load,
therefore, is an important factor in determining the degree to which memory for prose is disrupted by conditions
of divided attention. However, the study did not compare
prose with sequences of unrelated words, and was therefore not very informative about the nature of the processes disrupted by the secondary task. In addition, the
secondary task required participants to say irrelevant
material aloud, and would be expected to disrupt the
functioning of the phonological loop as well as requiring
participants to divide their attention between two tasks.
The present work examined the role of automatic and
controlled processes in WM for stories, sentences, and
words by means of a secondary task that was presumed
to disrupt attention-demanding processes. We used the
continuous choice reaction time (CRT) task employed
by Craik, Govoni, Naveh-Benjamin, and Anderson
(1996). Participants were required to press one of four
keys corresponding to the position of a visual stimulus
on the computer screen; a correct response caused the
stimulus to move immediately to a new location. This
method had a number of advantages. First, participants
were required to divide their attention continuously between two tasks, placing a load on the executive component of WM. The secondary task did not involve verbal
material or vocalisation, so should not have placed a load
on the phonological loop component of WM. Second,
Craik et al. showed that this task successfully disrupted
memory performance. Third, reaction times provide a
sensitive measure of the degree of disruption of the secondary task produced by the primary memory task.
The stories, sentences, and word lists were presented
to each participant three times in successive trials allowing the role of learning to be examined. With multiple
presentations, encoding tends to switch from phonolog-

626

ical to semantic, as reflected by both similarity effects in
serial recall (Baddeley, 1966a) and the development of
semantically based clustering in free recall (Tulving,
1962). It seems likely, therefore, that with repeated presentations, attention-demanding binding mechanisms
will become more important in the recall of unrelated
words (especially given that we used a fast presentation
rate of two items per second, which would have discouraged the formation of associations between unrelated
items on the first presentation). Consequently, any effect
of divided attention on word recall was expected to increase across learning trials.
It was anticipated that recall would be substantially
higher for sentences than word lists. If sequences of a
single fixed length were studied, it might be difficult to
avoid either ceiling effects in sentence recall or floor effects in word recall. Therefore, word and sentence span
was established for each participant at the start of the
testing session, and the length of material presented subsequently was set at 50% greater than span. This method
helped to ensure that the word and sentence span tasks
were of equivalent initial difficulty. The use of supraspan material made it possible to examine learning of
the sentences and words over several trials.
Experiment 1 compared recall of strings of unrelated
sentences and words under baseline control conditions
and while participants performed an attention-demanding concurrent task. This methodology allowed a
comparison of the relative importance of attentiondemanding processes in word and sentence recall. In
Experiment 2, this methodology was extended to look
at different lengths of material, ranging from just above
span to far beyond span. Beyond span, the amount of
material to be recalled is assumed to exceed the capacity
of the phonological loop. Performance is likely to be
supplemented by the involvement of LTM. If the contribution from LTM is greater for sentences than words,
participants may recall sentences better than word lists
above span, despite the fact that sequence length was adjusted so as to match performance at span. Experiment 3
examined participantsO recall of three types of verbal
material under single and dual-task conditions: (1) unrelated words, (2) sequences of short unrelated sentences,
and (3) related sentences that formed a story. The comparison of these two types of sentence material helped to
establish exactly which aspects of the encoding of sentences required controlled processing.

Experiment 1
Method
Design
A repeated measures design was used. Recall was
tested: (1) with or without a concurrent choice reaction

time (CRT) task, (2) with sentences or unrelated words
as the material to be recalled, and (3) across three repeated presentations (allowing the effect of learning to
be explored). The order of conditions was fully counter-balanced across subjects.
Participants
The participants were 24 psychology undergraduates,
who took part for course credit. The participants in all
three experiments were aged between 18 and 45, spoke
English as a first language, and had no reported history
of hearing or speech difficulties. Three subjects with
exceptionally slow reaction times (more than 3.5 SD
away from the mean) were excluded from the analysis
and replaced, because of the risk that they were not performing both tasks simultaneously.
Materials
The primary task involved serial recall of unrelated
words, and words that formed sentences. The number
of words that participants were asked to recall depended
on their span level, established at the start of the testing
session (see Procedure below). Participants were presented with sentences and word lists that were 50%
greater than their spans in order to reduce ceiling effects.
A total of 86 sentences were generated for this study.
They were factual in content, contained between four
and seven words and were designed to read naturally.
The sentences used simple syntactic structures and
avoided embedded clauses and conjunctions. Two, three
or four unrelated sentences were strung together to produce longer sentence material (examples are provided in
the Appendix). This method was preferred to using
increasingly long single sentences, as the potential confound between grammatical complexity and sentence
length was avoided. However, difficulty may not have
increased smoothly with the number of words tested because lists containing a larger number of sentences may
have been harder to recall. As the sentences comprising
each list were unrelated in meaning, sentence spans may
be lower than those reported elsewhere in the literature.
Sentences were not repeated during the course of the
experiment.
The lists of unrelated words were generated from the
sentences (examples are provided in the Appendix). As
word span is generally smaller than sentence span, only
a subset of the sentence words were included in the word
lists. The words used in the sentences were divided into
four categories: (1) nouns, (2) verbs, (3) adjectives and
adverbs, and (4) function words, according to the role
each word played in the sentence. Estimates of the frequency of each word in written English were obtained
from Kucera and Francis (1967) using the MRC psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981). The four word
types were divided into five frequency categories, and
the unrelated word lists were formed by drawing words

E. Jefferies et al. / Journal of Memory and Language 51 (2004) 623-643

pseudo-randomly from each of these categories so that
the overall proportion of words in each category was
the same for the sentences and word lists. Word lists that
contained related words or multiple copies of a single
word were discarded. As this method matched the unrelated word lists to the entire set of sentences, there may
have been some unsystematic differences in word characteristics between the conditions for individual participants, given that the materials presented depended on
span.
Two parallel versions of the test material were created for each span level. One version was used in conjunction with the secondary CRT task and the other
was used under control conditions of undivided attention. Each version was presented concurrently with the
CRT task for half of the participants. The sentences
and word lists were recorded using a microphone attached to a computer, and were copied onto a compact
disc. They were spoken in a monotone female voice, at
the rate of 2 words per second. Each word was recorded
separately and neighbouring words were placed together
using computer software (Wave Studio, Creative), to ensure that there were no differences in prosody between
the sentences and word lists.
The secondary choice reaction time (CRT) task was
based on a task used by Craik et al. (1996). The computerised task was presented using SuperLab software (Cedrus), and involved a visual display of four boxes in a
line. A star appeared at random in one of the boxes,
and the subject was required to press a corresponding
key on the keyboard as fast as possible (z, x, ., or /).
The task was self-paced, with the next trial being presented immediately after a correct response. The advantage of this method was that errors could be expressed as
a time cost, allowing a single measure (time taken to
produce correct response) to indicate performance.
The computer recorded reaction times (RT) for correct
and incorrect responses.
Procedure
Span was assessed for unrelated words and sentences
at the start of the testing session. The word lists and sentences were produced using the method described above,
and were played back from a tape. Testing was started at
four words for word span and at eight words for sentence span. No participants failed to obtain the minimum span tested. Participants were asked to repeat
back the words they had heard in the correct order, taking care to use exactly the same words. Four strings of
words were played at each span level. Span was defined
as the longest length at which two of the four strings
were repeated correctly. Testing was stopped when participants failed to recall all four of the strings.
Each participant received practice at the CRT task,
followed by a total of six blocks of practice on the sentence and word list recall tasks while performing the

627

CRT task concurrently. The length of the material on
the practice trials was 50% greater than the mean sentence and word spans obtained during pilot testing. In
each block of practice, the same words or sentences were
played twice, on two successive trials. There was a period of 10 s before the words were played, in which the
CRT task was performed alone. Subjects were required
to continue with the CRT task while they listened to
the words, and during a 10-s retention interval. If they
stopped or slowed noticeably on the CRT task, they
were prompted to continue. When a tone was sounded,
participants stopped performing the CRT task, and attempted to recall what they had heard in serial order.
After 15 s, the tone was repeated to indicate that the next
trial was starting, and the CRT task should be continued. The test trials were identical to the practice trials,
except that the retention interval was 20 s and each sentence or word list was presented three times in successive
learning trials. Trials without the concurrent CRT task
had the same structure, but participants were only
required to remember the words they heard. Written
records were made of participantsO recall attempts and,
where necessary, these were checked against an audio
recording of the experimental session.
Results
Span measures
Mean word span was 6.50 words (standard deviation
(SD = 1.06), and mean sentence span was 13.71 words
(SD = 1.90). There was a significant correlation between
the two span measurements (r = .61, p < .001) and sentence span was significantly larger than word span
(t(23) = 23.50, p < .001).
Recall accuracy
Figs. 1A and B show the mean percentage of words
recalled in each condition. As participants were asked
to recall the items in serial order, it was possible to
examine both the percentage of words recalled in total,
and the percentage of words recalled in the correct order. The results for these two measures were very similar
and for the sake of brevity only total recall is presented
for all three experiments.
A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
revealed significant main effects of material, secondary
task, and trial. The sentences were recalled better than
the word lists (F(1, 23) = 20.25, p < .001), the secondary
task significantly impaired retention (F(1, 23) = 8.77,
p < .01), and recall improved with repeated presentations of the same material (F(2, 46) = 240.17, p < .001).
There was a significant interaction between material
and trial (F(2, 46) = 15.26, p < .001) caused by faster
learning of the sentences than the word lists. Bonferroni:
tests indicated that the recall of words and sentences did
not differ on Trial 1 (t(23) < 1), whereas the sentences

were recalled more accurately than the words on Trials 2
and 3 (t(23) = 5.50, p < .001 and t(23) = 5.57, p < .001,
respectively).
The three-way interaction between material, secondary task, and trial was also significant (F(2, 46) = 5.13,
p < .05). The size of the dual task decrement for sentences did not change significantly across the three trials
in which the same material was repeated (F(2, 46) = 1.20,
ns). In contrast, the secondary task effect for word lists
increased over trials (F(2, 46) = 4.15, p < .05). Bonferroni: tests revealed that the secondary task did not significantly affect retention of the word lists on either
Trials 1 or 2 (t(23) < 1 and t(23) = 1.23, ns, respectively)
but did impair retention of the word lists on Trial 3
(t(23) = 3.44, p < .01). This finding suggests that presenting the word lists repeatedly facilitated the use of attention-demanding encoding processes.
The secondary task impaired retention of the sentences to a greater extent than the word lists on Trial
1 (F(1, 23) = 4.75, p < .05) but not on Trials 2 or 3
(F(1, 23) < 1 and F(1, 23) = 2.52, ns). Bonferroni: tests
indicated that on Trial 1, the secondary task impaired
recall of the sentences (t(23) = 2.63, p < .05) but did
not impair recall of the word lists (t(23) < 1). Therefore,
attentional processes may have played a larger role in
sentence than word span on Trial 1 when the material
was novel. On later trials this interaction did not occur,
presumably because attention-demanding processes
played a greater role in word recall following learning.

Recall errors
Different types of errors during word and sentence recall may reflect differences in the coding used in these
tasks. Incorrect responses were categorised as omission,
order, and item errors. Omission errors were calculated
by subtracting the correct responses and other error
types from the number of presented words. Order errors
were target words produced in the wrong place in the sequence. Item errors were further classified as phonological, semantic, morphological, repetition, and unrelated
errors. Phonological errors shared at least half of their
phonemes with a target word. Semantic errors were related in meaning to one of the target words. Morphological errors retained the correct word stem, but were
incorrectly marked (e.g., OwalksO became OwalkedO). These
errors were also semantically and phonologically related
to the target word, but were placed in this separate category. Repetition errors were target words produced
more than once. Errors that did not fall into one of these
categories were classified as Ounrelated.O A small number
of OunclassifiableO errors fell into more than one category
and were not analysed further.
Table 1 shows the mean number of omission, morphological, phonological, semantic, repetition, and unrelated errors for words and sentences as a percentage of
the number of items presented, and order errors as a percentage of total item recall. A series of t tests, corrected
for multiple comparisons, revealed that omission and order errors occurred more frequently in word recall

(t(23) = 4.69, p < .001 and t(23) = 5.33, p < .001, respectively). Semantic and unrelated errors were more common in sentence recall (t(23) = 5.37, p < .001 and
t(23) = 4.11, p < .05, respectively), possibly reflecting
the greater role played by semantic coding in this task.
All of these effects reached significance in nonparametric
tests (WilcoxonOs signed ranks).
Reaction times
RT was recorded during three periods in each trial:
before the words began to play (baseline), while the
words were playing (encoding), and after they had finished playing but before recall could commence (retention). Mean reaction times are shown in Table 2.
In the data set as a whole, reaction times were faster
during sentence than word recall (F(1, 23) = 22.84,
p < .001). In addition, reaction times were slower when
the CRT task was performed concurrently with the
memory task compared with when it was performed
alone (F(2, 46) = 53.05, p < .001). RT was slower in the
retention period relative to baseline (Bonferroni:
t(23) = 6.06, p < .001) and was slower during encoding
than retention (t(23) = 4.71, p < .001).
There was a significant interaction between material
and trial (F(2, 46) = 3.29, p < .05) apparently because
RT increased for words but not sentences over the three
trials in which the same material was repeated. Bonferroni: tests indicated that there was no significant RT difference between the words and sentences on Trial 1
(t(23) = 1.60, ns) whereas RT was slower for the words
on Trials 2 and 3 (t(23) = 3.59, p < .05, and t(23) =
4.13, p < .001, respectively). This finding is consistent
with the larger dual task decrement in retention observed for the word lists on later trials, and suggests that
attention-demanding processes played a greater role in
word span after learning had occurred.
There was a significant interaction between material
and period (F(2, 46) = 11.74, p < .001) because the overall RT cost of performing the memory task was greater
for the words than for the sentences. There was no significant difference between words and sentences in the
baseline period (t(23) < 1), but reaction times were
slower for the words during the encoding and retention
periods (t(23) = 4.73, p < .001, and t(23) = 3.42, p < .05,
respectively).

Discussion
In this experiment, participants were required to
perform a choice reaction time (CRT) task whilst
encoding and retaining sentences and word lists for serial recall. The CRT task was found to disrupt memory
for novel sentences to a greater extent than word lists.
Memory for the two materials was equivalent under
single task conditions, suggesting that the differential
effect of the secondary task could not be attributed
to overall difficulty. Although the chunking processes
underlying the span advantage for sentences could have
been relatively automatic (relying, for example, on preexisting associations between representations in LTM),
our results are consistent with the view that attention
played an important role in sentence recall, in line with
the proposals of Baddeley (2000) and Cowan (1995).
These accounts suggest that attention is required to
forge novel associations in WM: the formation of such
links may be crucial for sentence comprehension/recall,
given the need to assimilate the words comprising a
sentence (and in this experiment specifically, the need
to bind together several sentences with unrelated meanings; see Experiment 3). In contrast, the recall of relatively meaningless lists of unrelated words may initially
depend more on automatic phonological coding that
is comparatively resistant to the effects of divided
attention.
A larger number of semantic errors occurred during
the sentence span task, suggesting that semantic coding
played a greater role in the retention of sentences than
word lists. Fewer order errors occurred for the sentences, presumably because the sentence structure placed
constraints on the likely order of the words.
Over three trials in which the same material was repeated, the sentences were learned more quickly than
the word lists. In addition, the secondary task produced
a greater disruption to the recall of unrelated words following learning, so that on later trials, an equivalent secondary task decrement was observed for the two
materials. This finding suggests that although attention-demanding processes played a rather limited role
in the memory task for novel lists of unrelated words,
they made a more substantial contribution following
learning.

How can we account for this finding? On the first
trial, participants may have been largely unable to forge
links between the unrelated words, especially given the
rapid presentation rate of 2 items per second, and consequently they may have relied on relatively automatic
phonological coding. As the word set became more
familiar however, participants may have been able to enhance their recall by forming novel associations between
the list items: according to the theories of Baddeley
(2000) and Cowan (1995), such integrative encoding is
attention-demanding, potentially explaining the increase
in the impact of divided attention on word recall.
Reaction times on the secondary CRT task were
consistent with this interpretation. On the initial trial,
there was no RT difference for words and sentences.
It seems unlikely, therefore, that the larger dual task
decrement in retention observed for sentences could
be accounted for in terms of differential trade-offs between the memory and CRT tasks. During subsequent
presentations of the same material, RT increased for
the unrelated words, consistent with a greater role of
attention-demanding encoding following learning. On
these later trials, the sentences had benefited from rapid
learning and were recalled more accurately than the
word lists so the faster RT associated with the sentence
recall task may also have arisen because the sentences
were less taxing.
In sum, these results suggest that, on the first trial,
attention played a more substantial role in the memory
task for sentences than word lists. On subsequent trials,
the unrelated word lists also became sensitive to disruption by the secondary task. We have argued that this
pattern reflects the importance of attention-demanding
integrative encoding in sentence span, and a shift from
relatively automatic phonological to more controlled
integrative encoding of unrelated word lists following
learning. However, one caveat should be noted: the effect of divided attention purportedly arose during
encoding; however, as the CRT task was performed
both while the sentences and words were presented
and throughout a retention interval in this experiment,
it is not clear whether the dual task decrement reflected
the disruption of attentional control processes during
encoding or retention or both. In the following experiment, the retention period was eliminated from the
experimental design, allowing a more specific attribution
of the dual task decrement to the encoding period.

Experiment 2
This experiment examined the recall of word lists and
sentences with and without a concurrent secondary task,
to provide a replication and extension of Experiment 1.
Different lengths of material were examined, ranging
from 50% above span (as in Experiment 1) to 200%

above span. On trials where length was increased far
above span, percentage recall might be expected to decline more gradually for sentences than word lists because of the greater involvement of LTM in the
immediate recall of sentences. Word span might be expected to be less resistant to supra span increases in
length because of its greater reliance on the limited
capacity phonological loop.
Method
Design
A repeated-measures design was used to examine the
impact of material, secondary task, trial, and list length
on immediate recall. Participants were presented with
material at three lengths: 50% above span, 100% above
span, and 200% above span. The order of the conditions
was pseudo-randomly assigned across the subjects in a
way that controlled for practice effects.
Participants
The participants were 24 psychology undergraduates
who took part for course credit. Three participants with
exceptionally slow reaction times (more than 3.5 SD
away from the mean) were excluded from the analysis
and replaced.
Materials
`The materials were constructed from the pool of
sentences used in the previous experiment. As in
Experiment 1, the sentence material for each trial
was formed from several unrelated sentences (three to
five sentences for the 50% above span condition; four
to seven for the 100% above span condition; and 6-
10 for the 200% above span condition). Sentences were
not repeated during the course of the experiment. Two
parallel versions of the test material were created for
each span level. One version was used in conjunction
with the secondary CRT task, and the other was used
under single task conditions. Both versions occurred in
the single task condition for half the participants. The
secondary task was the choice reaction time task used
in Experiment 1. Other details are as described for
Experiment 1.
Procedure
Span was assessed for unrelated words and sentences
at the start of the testing session, using the method described for Experiment 1. Participants then received
practice at the CRT task alone, followed by six blocks
of practice at the sentence and word recall tasks while
performing the CRT task concurrently. The length of
the practice material was 50, 100, and 200% greater than
the average span for words and sentences obtained in
Experiment 1. The practice and test trials in Experiment
2 had a similar structure to those in Experiment 1,

E. Jefferies et al. / Journal of Memory and Language 51 (2004) 623-643

although the retention period was removed to allow a
more specific attribution of the influence of the secondary task to encoding processes. In trials involving the
CRT task, there was a 10 s period of CRT before the
words began to play, which was used to indicate baseline
reaction times, and participants were required to carry
out the CRT task while the sentences or words were
playing. When a tone sounded, participants stopped
the CRT task, and attempted to recall what they had
heard in correct serial order. Trials without the concurrent CRT task had the same structure but participants
were only required to try to remember the words they
heard. As in Experiment 1, each sentence or word list
was repeated three times to allow the effect of learning
to be examined.

significantly larger than word span (t(23) = 21.60,
p < .001).
Recall accuracy
Figs. 2A and B indicate the percentage of words recalled in any order for words and sentences when length
was 50% above span, Figs. 2C and D indicate recall at
100% above span and Figs. 2E and F recall at 200%
above span. The main effects of material, dual task,
length, and trial were all significant. Sentences were recalled more accurately than the unrelated words
(F(1, 23) = 68.65, p < .001), recall was poorer under
dual-task conditions (F(1, 23), = 11.24, p < .01), percentage recall was lower on longer lists (F(2, 46) = 210.68,
p < .001) and recall improved over repeated presentations of the same material (F(2, 46) = 445.31, p < .001)

Results
Span measures
Mean word span was 5.88 words (SD = 0.80) and
mean sentence span was 12.88 words (SD = 1.75). There
was a significant correlation between the two span measurements (r = .42, p < .05) and sentence span was

Shortest list length (50% above span). To allow direct
comparison with the results of Experiment 1, the data
from the three list lengths will be described separately,
starting with the 50% above span length that was used
in the previous experiment. At this list length, there
was a significant interaction between material and trial

(F(2, 46) = 24.35, p < .001) suggesting that, as in Experiment 1, the sentences were learned more rapidly than the
lists of unrelated words. Bonferroni: t tests indicated
that the recall of the words and sentences did not differ
on Trial 1 (t(23) = 1.79, ns), whereas the sentences were
recalled more accurately than the words on Trials 2 and
3 (t(23) = 5.03, p < .001 and t(23) = 6.12, p < .001,
respectively).
As in Experiment 1, the three-way interaction between material, secondary task, and trial was significant
(F(2, 46) = 7.97, p < .01). Divided attention impaired
word recall to a greater extent following learning
(F(2, 46) = 4.05, p < .05). Bonferroni: t tests revealed
that the secondary task did not affect retention of the
word lists on either Trials 1 and 2 (t(23) < 1.40, ns),
but did impair retention of the word lists on Trial 3
(t(23) = 2.79, p < .05). Therefore, attentional processes
may have played a greater role in the word span task
following learning. In contrast, the size of the dual task
decrement for sentences actually decreased across the
three trials due to ceiling effects (F(2, 46) = 4.46,
p < .05). The secondary task impaired sentence recall
on Trial 1 (t(23) = 3.53, p < .01), but not on Trials 2
and 3 (t(23) < 1.89, ns).
This experiment also replicated the finding of a larger
dual task decrement for sentences than for unrelated
words on Trial 1 (F(1, 23) = 11.74, p < .01), suggesting
that attentional processes played a larger role in sentence than word recall when the material was novel. This
interaction did not occur on Trials 2 and 3 (F(1, 23) <
2.40, p < .14), consistent with the notion that learning
increased the role of attentional processes in the word
span task.
Therefore, at 50% above span in both experiments:
(1) divided attention impaired the recall of novel sentences more than word lists and (2) the effect of the secondary task increased for word lists when they were
presented repeatedly.
Longer list lengths (100 and 200 % above span). The
material by trial interaction remained significant when list
length was increased to 100% above span (F(2, 46) =
43.57, p < .001) and 200% above span ( F(2, 46) = 51.24,
p < .001), reflecting the fact that the sentences were
learned faster than the word lists with repeated presentations. In fact, the strength of the material by trial interaction grew with list length (F(4, 92) = 4.92, p < .01),
apparently because on the shorter list lengths, sentence recall on later trials was limited by ceiling effects.
The three-way interaction between material, dual
task, and trial was marginally significant for the 100%
above span condition (F(2, 46) = 4.23, p < .05) but did
not reach significance for the 200% above span condition (F(2, 46) = 1.88, ns). The strength of this three-way
interaction appeared to weaken as list length increased,
consistent with the four-way interaction between mate-

rial, dual task, trial, and list length that was obtained
in the experiment as a whole (F(4, 92) = 6.33, p < .001).
For the two longer list lengths, divided attention did
not impair the recall of unrelated words on any trial,
even following learning (all t(23) < 1.08, ns). It is possible that the number of items in the lists, combined with
the rapid presentation speed, discouraged participants
from adopting attention-demanding integrative encoding to enhance word recall.
The larger dual task decrement for sentences compared with words, observed on Trial 1 in the 50% above
span condition, also reached significance for lists 100%
above span (F(1, 23) = 6.54, p < .05) but did not occur
for lists 200% above span (F(1, 23) < 1). On Trials 2
and 3, there was no material by dual task interaction
for any list length (all comparisons were ns). In summary, we found that conditions of divided attention impaired the recall of novel sentences to a greater extent
than unrelated words when list length was relatively
short but not when it was longer.
The material by length interaction in the experiment as
a whole reached significance (F(2, 46) = 13.33, p < .001).
As the length of material to be remembered was increased, percentage recall declined less rapidly for sentences compared with words. Bonferroni: tests indicated
that, in the experiment overall, there was a small but significant recall difference between words and sentences on
the shortest length, collapsing across the three trials
(t(23) = 2.97, p < .05). Sentence recall was substantially
better than word recall on the longer lengths, 100 and
200% above span (t(23) = 6.77, p < .001 and t(23) =
8.71, p < .001, respectively). The greater involvement of
LTM in sentence span may have made this task more
resistant to supra span increases in length. Word span
may have been less resistant because of its heavy reliance
on the limited capacity phonological loop.
Recall errors
Errors were coded as for Experiment 1. Table 1
shows the mean number of omission, morphological,
phonological, semantic, repetition, and unrelated errors
for words and sentences as a percentage of the number
of items presented. Order errors are also shown, expressed as a percentage of total item recall. A series of
t tests, corrected for multiple comparisons, revealed that
there were more omission (t(23) = 6.60, p < .001), morphological (t(23) = 5.27, p < .001), phonological
(t(23) = 5.95, p < .001), and repetition errors (t(23) =
2.98, p < .05) in word recall. In contrast, semantic errors
were more common in sentence recall (t(23) = 8.13,
p < .001), possibly reflecting the greater role played by
semantic coding in this task. All of these effects reached
significance in nonparametric tests (WilcoxonOs signed
ranks).
Although there was no overall difference in order errors for words and sentences, order errors were more

E. Jefferies et al. / Journal of Memory and Language 51 (2004) 623-643

numerous for the words at the shortest list length, consistent with the results of Experiment 1 (words mean =
16.8%, SD = 7.8; sentences mean = 8.5%, SD = 11.6;
Bonferroni: t(22) = 4.35, p < .001). In addition, there
was a material by dual task interaction for order errors
in this experiment (F(1, 22) = 6.41, p < .05). Post hoc
analyses indicated that the secondary task significantly
impaired order memory for word lists (single task condition = 15.7%, SD = 9.9; dual-task condition = 22.9%,
SD = 10.9; Bonferroni: t(22) = 3.82, p < .01). In contrast, the secondary task did not impair order memory
for sentences (single task condition = 15.7%, SD =
15.6; dual-task condition = 16.7%, SD = 17.0; Bonferroni: t(22) < 1). This finding is consistent with the notion
that attention plays a role in integrative encoding in
verbal STM. For sentences, there are long-term linguistic constraints on word order and these might operate
relatively automatically. In contrast, the order of unrelated words is arbitrary and attention might be required
to form links between these previously unrelated items.
It should be noted, however, that this interaction did
not reach significance (and is not discussed) for Experiments 1 and 3. It seems likely that this was because the
longer list lengths in the current experiment made an
important contribution to the material by trial interaction, although the higher order interaction with length
was not significant.
Reaction times
RT was recorded during two periods in each trial:
before the words began to play (baseline), and while they
were playing (encoding). Mean RT is shown in Table 3.

633

Overall, there were significant main effects of material
(F(1, 23) = 46.66, p < .001) and time period (F(1, 23) =
68.13, p < .001). RT was slower for words than for sentences and slower during the encoding period relative to
baseline.
There was a significant three-way interaction between
material, trial, and time period (F(2, 46) = 3.85, p < .05).
The RT cost of encoding increased for words (F(2, 46)
= 4.58, p < .05) but not sentences (F(2, 46) < 1) over the
three successive trials, in line with the findings of Experiment 1. For unrelated words, there was a marginally significant increase in RT during encoding between Trials 1
and 2 (uncorrected t(23) = 2.36, p < .05) but not between
Trials 2 and 3 (t(23) < 1). There was no change in baseline
RT across the three trials (t(23) < 1.17, ns). This pattern is
suggestive of a greater role for attention-demanding
encoding processes in word recall following learning
and is consistent with the larger dual task decrement in
retention observed for words on later trials.
As in Experiment 1, there was no RT difference between sentences and words on Trial 1 for the 50% above
span length (t(23) < 1), suggesting that the larger dual
task decrement in retention observed for sentences observed under these conditions could not be accounted
for in terms of differential trade-offs between the memory and CRT tasks.
The overall RT cost of encoding was greater for
words than for sentences (F(1, 23) = 32.42, p < .001). In
addition, the interaction between time period and trial
in the data set as a whole was marginally significant,
reflecting the pattern observed for unrelated words
(F(2, 46) = 3.18, p = .05).

Discussion
The experiment replicated the key findings of Experiment 1. For sequences 50% above span, a concurrent
choice reaction time (CRT) task during encoding was
found to disrupt the retention of novel sentences to a
greater extent than word lists, even though the two
materials were recalled equally well in the absence of
the CRT task. This finding suggests that attention may
play a role in the binding that underpins sentence recall,
as envisaged by Baddeley (2000).
The secondary task had relatively little effect on the
retention of the unrelated words when they were first
presented but a more detrimental effect on their recall
following learning, as in the previous experiment. This
result indicates that with multiple presentations, attention-demanding encoding processes play an increasingly
substantial role in word recall. Reaction times on the
CRT task were consistent with this pattern as they increased for words but not sentences when the material
was repeated. Repetition of the words may have allowed
participants to improve their recall through the formation of associations between unrelated items in WM: this
is envisaged as attention demanding by several theoretical perspectives (e.g., Baddeley, 2000; Cowan, 1995). It
seems likely that the dissimilar nature of the words
and the rapid presentation speed would have discouraged the formation of these links on the first trial.
As in Experiment 1, semantic errors were more frequent in sentence than word recall. In contrast, phonological errors were more common in word recall,
supporting the view that this task relied more heavily
on a phonological code. The error analysis also suggested that divided attention specifically impaired order
memory for unrelated words but not sentences. This
finding concurs with the hypothesis that encoding in
WM is more attention demanding when participants
are required to form new associations between previously unrelated LTM representations. The order of
unrelated words is arbitrary and consequently might require attention to learn, whereas there are pre-existing
linguistic constraints on word order for sentences that
might operate relatively automatically. It will, however,
be important to establish the generality of this finding in
future research.
As the amount of material to be remembered was
increased, percentage recall declined, although less
rapidly for sentences than for word lists. The greater
linguistic support in the sentence span task may have
made memory for this type of material more robust to
supra span increases in length. Word span, on the
other hand, may have been more reliant on the limited
capacity phonological loop and consequently unable
to withstand supra span increases in length. The retention of long lengths of material was relatively unaffected by conditions of divided attention, suggesting

that the contribution of linguistic factors depended
principally on automatic rather than controlled processes under these conditions. Although we did not
specifically predict this outcome, participants may
have been more likely to abandon attention-demanding encoding strategies when the task itself was very
taxing.

Experiment 3
The experiments discussed so far have suggested
that LTM support for WM relies on both attentiondemanding and more automatic encoding processes,
with their relative importance varying across tasks.
The recall of novel sentences was found to place greater demands on controlled processing than the recall of
unrelated word lists; however, it is not clear which aspects of the sentence recall task were effortful. There
are at least two possibilities, both of which are
broadly consistent with the proposals of Baddeley
(2000) and Cowan (1995). First, it seems likely that
sentence recall requires the integration of different linguistic codes as well as diverse propositions/concepts
in order to derive a mental model of the overall meaning of the sentence, and this process of semantically/
syntactically guided chunking may require attention.
Alternatively, as the sentential material was composed
of several short sentences that were unrelated in meaning, it is possible that divided attention interfered with
the binding of unrelated sentence chunks (or reduced
the number of unrelated sentences that participants
were able to maintain simultaneously), rather than
interfering with the process of within-sentence chunking per se. This experiment allowed a comparison of
these possibilities.
The second alternative is perhaps coherent with
CowanOs (2000) suggestion of a basic capacity limitation of four unrelated chunks that can be held in the
focus of attention at any one time: conditions of divided attention might be expected to reduce this capacity, preventing the formation of links between
unrelated sentences and causing participants to forget
entire sentences. The distinction between these two possibilities may also be relevant to the LT-WM model
(Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995): although the creation of
retrieval structures may be effortful in some circumstances, as in the case of digit span experts, it is unclear
whether mental model construction in sentence comprehension/recall draws on exactly the same processes
(Miyake & Shah, 1999). Consequently, the ability to
forge links between several unrelated sentences may
be more effortful than the parsing and comprehension
of a single sentence.
Although the items in the word lists were unrelated in
meaning, attention-demanding binding processes may

E. Jefferies et al. / Journal of Memory and Language 51 (2004) 623-643

not have been crucial in supporting their recall on the
first trial because the specific conditions in the experiments (e.g., fast presentation speed and relatively high
proportion of function words with few semantic associations) would have made it difficult for participants to
adopt such strategies, forcing them to fall back onto a
phonological code. Consequently, chunk size would
have been rather limited and a dual task decrement in
the ability to bind together unrelated chunks would have
had relatively little impact on overall recall. It seems
likely that participants would have started to construct
larger multiword chunks with repeated presentations
of the unrelated word list, producing a larger dual task
decrement on later trials. In addition, how can we account for the finding that the secondary task substantially impaired sentence recall at shorter but not longer
list lengths? At longer list lengths, the number of unrelated sentences would have greatly exceeded participantsO WM capacity as envisaged by Cowan (2000); as
a result, pre-established linguistic associations operating
relatively automatically would have been more critical in
determining recall than the ability to bind together unrelated sentences.
In Experiment 3, the recall of unrelated words and
unrelated sentences was examined as before, but in
addition, the design incorporated related sentences
that formed a story. If the construction of mental
models through semantically guided chunking is attention-demanding, a concurrent task might be expected
to have the greatest impact on story recall, which presumably involves the construction of complex mental
models spanning several sentences. In contrast, if divided attention specifically makes it difficult to bind
together unrelated chunks, the concurrent task should
have the greatest impact on the retention of unrelated
sentences.
Method
Design
A repeated-measures design was used. Recall of unrelated words, unrelated sentences, and stories was tested
with and without a concurrent secondary task. The
length of test sequences was 50% greater than each participantOs span for the three materials.
Participants
A total of 24 participants were paid to take part in
the experiment. They were a mixed group of undergraduate and postgraduate students and volunteers. Two
subjects with exceptionally slow reaction times (more
than 3.5 SD away from the mean) were excluded from
the analysis and replaced. The order of conditions was
pseudo-randomly assigned across subjects, so that each
condition appeared in each position an equal number
of times.

Materials
The unrelated sentences and words in both the span
tests and the experimental trials were derived from the
story material. The stories were composed of short sentences containing between five and eight words, each
with a unique content that built on the previous sentences. For the experimental trials, eight stories were constructed, each containing six sentences. Several versions
of each sentence that contained slightly different numbers
of words were produced, so that material for the full
range of spans could be constructed. Two of the stories
were selected to be the test stories, and versions were constructed for each span level. The remaining six stories
formed the unrelated sentence material. Sentences were
selected from these stories so that participants never
heard the same sentence twice, and so that sequences of
sentences never contained more than one sentence from
a story. The unrelated test words were drawn pseudorandomly from the story and unrelated sentence test
material. Words were not repeated within a trial.
Some additional controls were employed to ensure
that the three types of material were equivalent. The
words used in the stories and sentences were divided into
four groups: (1) nouns, (2) verbs, (3) adjectives and adverbs, and (4) function words. Each of these groups was
divided into four frequency categories, using estimates
of written word frequency from the Celex database
(Baayen, Piepenbrock, & van Rijn, 1993). The proportions of words in each of these categories were calculated
for the stories and sentences, and the composition of
both materials was adjusted so that the proportions in
the stories and sentences, and in the span and test materials were as similar as possible. Words were selected
pseudo-randomly from the stories and sentences to form
the unrelated word material. The words were chosen so
that the overall proportion of words in each frequency
category for each word type matched those obtained
for the story and sentence materials. Some repetition
of common function words was inevitable in the stories
and sets of sentences as a whole, but this was kept to a
minimum, and the number of repeats was equal in the
two materials.
The span tests were constructed from 144 short stories, varying in length from two to four sentences (10
to 28 words). Half of the stories, selected at random,
were used in the story span test and half were used in
the sentence span test. The sentence span test was constructed by selecting sentences pseudo-randomly from
the stories assigned to this condition, so that the material had little overall meaning. List length was increased
two words at a time in the sentence and story span tasks.
The word span test was constructed by drawing unrelated words pseudo-randomly from the story and sentence span tests. Length was increased one word at a
time. Other methodological details were as described
above for the experimental trials.

Two versions of the test stories, unrelated sentences,
and unrelated word lists were formed. One was used in
conjunction with the secondary CRT task, while the
other was used under single task conditions. The two
versions were assigned randomly to the single and secondary task conditions, but so that each occurred in
the single task condition for half the participants. The
secondary task was the choice reaction time task, employed in Experiments 1 and 2.
Procedure
Spans for unrelated words, unrelated sentences, and
stories were assessed at the start of the testing session. Participants heard four strings at each length, and had to repeat two of them correctly for a span of that length.
Participants then received practice at the CRT task alone,
followed by six blocks of practice at the recall task while
performing the CRT task concurrently. Participants received equal practice for each of the materials.
The practice and test trials had the same structure as
in Experiment 2. In dual task trials, there was a 10 s period of CRT before the words began to play, which was
used to indicate baseline reaction times, and participants
were required to carry out the CRT task while the verbal
materials were playing. When a tone sounded, participants stopped the CRT task and attempted to recall
what they had heard in correct serial order. Trials without the concurrent CRT task had the same structure, but
participants were only required to try to remember the
words they heard. As in Experiments 1 and 2, each sen-

tence or word list was played three times in successive
trials.
Results
Span measures
Mean span was 5.8 (SD = 0.85) for unrelated words,
15.4 (SD = 2.60) for unrelated sentences, and 15.4
(SD = 2.60) for stories. Word span correlated significantly with story span (r = .52, p < .01) but not sentence
span (r = .32, ns). The strongest correlation was between
sentence span and story span (r = .67, p < .001). Word
span was significantly lower than both sentence and
story span (t(23) = 18.95, p < .001 and t(23) = 20.47,
p < .001, respectively). There was no significant difference between sentence and story span (t(23) < 1), suggesting that the presence of a story structure did not
increase the number of words that participants could
remember without error. It seems likely that this is because the span test examined recall of surface structure;
in contrast, gist recall may have been superior for the
stories (Johnson-Laird & Stevenson, 1970; Sachs, 1967).
Recall accuracy
Figs. 3A-C show the mean percentage of words recalled in any order for unrelated word lists, unrelated
sentences, and stories. To facilitate comparison between
experiments, participantsO recall of the unrelated words
and sentences will be described first, followed by their
recall of the stories. In the experiment as a whole,

there were significant main effects of material (F(2,
46) = 45.69, p < .001), dual task (F(1, 23) = 17.73, p <
.001), and trial (F(2, 46) = 208.01, p < .001) and an
interaction between material and trial (F(4, 92) =
13.13, p < .001).
Unrelated words and sentences. The sentences were recalled more accurately than the word lists in the experiment as a whole ( F(1, 23) = 21.91, p < .001). There was
an interaction between material and trial (F(2, 46) =
20.52, p < .001), which indicated that the sentences were
learned more rapidly than the word lists, as in the previous
experiments. Bonferroni: t tests showed that words and
sentences were recalled at an equivalent level on Trial 1
(t(23) < 1); in contrast, the sentences were recalled more
accurately than the words on Trial 2 (t(23) = 5.85,
p < .001) and Trial 3 (t(23) = 8.39, p < .001). The threeway interaction between material, dual task and trial also
approached significance but was weaker than in the two
previous experiments (F(2, 46) = 2.70, p = .08). There
was no significant material by dual task interaction for
the first trial (F(1, 23) = 1.67, ns), apparently because divided attention had a somewhat larger effect on the retention of novel lists of unrelated words in this experiment.
Nevertheless, planned comparisons indicated that the secondary task significantly impaired recall of sentences
(t(23) = 3.52, p < .01) but not word lists (t(23) = 1.56,
ns) on Trial 1, in line with the results of Experiments 1
and 2. On later trials, divided attention had a significant
impact on the recall of both word lists (Trial 2:
t(23) = 2.85, p < .01; Trial 3: t(23) = 2.31, p < .05) and
sentences (Trial 2: t(23) = 2.65, p < .05; Trial 3:
t(23) = 2.65, p < .05).
Unrelated sentences and stories. Unrelated sentences
and stories. The stories were recalled more accurately
than the unrelated sentences in the experiment as a
whole (F(1, 23) = 25.15, p < .001). The material by trial
interaction was again significant (F(1, 23) = 9.32,
p < .001), although this was apparently the result of ceiling effects for story recall in later trials. Bonferroni: t
tests indicated that story recall was more accurate than
sentence recall on every trial (Trial 1: t(23) = 4.78,
p < .001; Trial 2: t(23) = 3.86, p < .01; and Trial 3:
t(23) = 2.38, p = .08). Therefore, the method of linking
list length to span for each material failed to equate
the difficulty of recalling unrelated sentences and stories
that were 50% above span length--presumably because
the presence of a story structure did not facilitate the recall of surface structure (and so did not allow story span
to exceed sentence span) but did enhance gist recall at
supra-span lengths.
There was a significant material by dual task interaction (F(1, 23) = 4.24, p < .05), which indicated that the
secondary task impaired recall of the unrelated sentences
(t(23) = 3.54, p < .01) but not the stories (t(23) < 1).

637

Although the interpretation of this interaction is complicated by the fact that task difficultly was not equated for
the two materials, the effect remained significant (F(1,
11) = 12.29, p < .01) for a group of subjects who did
not show better story than sentence recall under single
task conditions (t(11) < 1). This group comprised the
12 participants who, under single task conditions,
showed the smallest difference between story and sentence recall. The three-way interaction between material,
dual task, and trial did not reach significance in this
experiment (F(2, 46) < 1).
Recall errors
Errors were coded as for Experiments 1 and 2. Table
1 shows the mean number of omission, morphological,
phonological, semantic, repetition, and unrelated errors
for words, sentences, and stories as a percentage of the
number of items presented. Order errors are also shown,
expressed as a percentage of total item recall. A series of
t tests, corrected for multiple comparisons, was used to
compare errors on words/sentences and sentences/stories. There were more omission (t(23) = 3.58, p < .05),
morphological (t(23) = 3.54, p < .05), phonological
(t(23) = 4.80, p < .01) and order errors (t(23) = 4.11,
p < .01) for words compared with sentences. In contrast,
semantic errors were more common in sentence than
word recall (t(23) = 7.26, p < .001), possibly reflecting
the greater role played by semantic coding in this task.
There were more omission errors for sentences compared with stories (t(23) = 5.49, p < .001), but no other
significant error differences between these two conditions. All of these effects reached significance in nonparametric tests (WilcoxonOs signed ranks).
Reaction times
RT was recorded during two periods in each trial: before the words began to play (baseline) and while they
were playing (encoding). Mean RT is shown in Table
4. To facilitate comparison between experiments, RT
during the encoding of unrelated words and sentences
will be described first, followed by an analysis of RT
during the sentences/stories tasks. There was a main effect of time period in the experiment as a whole
(F(2, 46) = 147.33, p < .001), reflecting the RT cost of
concurrent encoding.
Unrelated words and sentences. There was a main effect
of material (F(1, 23) = 28.64, p < .001), indicating that in
the experiment as a whole, reaction times were faster for
sentences than for word lists. The material by trial interaction approached significance (F(2, 46) = 2.59, p = .09),
apparently because RT increased across the three trials
for word lists but not sentences. Bonferroni: t tests indicated that there was no significant RT difference between sentences and words on the first trial (t(23) < 1),
whereas on Trials 2 and 3, RT was slower for the unre-

lated words (t(23) = 2.87, p < .05 and t(23) = 4.03,
p < .01, respectively). This pattern is suggestive of a
greater role for attention-demanding encoding processes
in word recall following learning and is consistent with
the larger dual task decrement in retention observed
for words on later trials. The overall reaction time cost
of encoding was greater for words than for sentences
(F(1, 23) = 30.07, p < .001). In addition, the interaction
between time period and trial in the data set as a whole
was significant, reflecting the pattern observed for unrelated words (F(2, 46) = 3.66, p < .05).
Unrelated sentences and stories. There was a main effect
of material (F(1, 23) = 7.61, p < .05) and a material by
time period interaction (F(1, 23) = 8.68, p < .01), indicating that the RT cost of encoding was greater for unrelated sentences compared with stories. Bonferroni: t
tests indicated that there was no difference in baseline
RT between the sentences and stories (t(23) < 1). In contrast, RT during encoding was greater for the sentences
relative to the stories (t(23) = 3.20, p < .01), suggesting
that there may have been a trade-off between memory
and RT performance. ParticipantsO recall of the unrelated sentences was poorer than that of the stories despite their slower reaction times, suggesting that the
unrelated sentences relied more heavily on attention-demanding processes. No other interactions reached or approached significance.
Discussion
This experiment compared the impact of a secondary
CRT task on the recall of unrelated words, unrelated
sentences, and stories composed of related sentences.
In the two previous experiments, it was found that divided attention substantially impaired the recall of novel
unrelated sentences but only impaired the recall of unrelated words following learning. The current experiment
aimed to determine which aspects of the sentence recall
task involved controlled processing. If the construction
of mental models through semantically guided chunking
is attention-demanding, then a concurrent task might be
expected to impair story recall to a greater extent than
sentence recall; if in contrast, divided attention specifically interferes with the binding of unrelated chunks,
then a secondary task should have the greatest impact

on the retention of unrelated sentences. The results supported the second of these two possibilities. As in the
previous experiments, divided attention was found to
substantially impair the recall of unrelated sentences
but this effect did not generalise to the recall of stories.
The RT data were consistent with this pattern: the RT
cost of encoding was larger for unrelated sentences than
for stories.
The previous finding that divided attention impaired
the recall of novel sentences to a greater extent than
word lists did not quite reach significance in this experiment, although there was a trend in this direction. It is
not clear why this effect was weaker in the current experiment. However, if divided attention specifically interferes with the binding of unrelated items, it might be
expected that a concurrent task would have some effect
on word list recall. Moreover, it is clear from Experiments 1 and 2 that divided attention can impair the recall of unrelated words in some circumstances (i.e.,
following learning). It seems likely that although the recall of unrelated sentences is more vulnerable to disruption by a secondary task than the recall of unrelated
words, the size of this interaction may be sensitive to
the nature of the words in the lists. This possibility,
which is raised again in the General discussion, warrants
further investigation.

The effect of a concurrent task on sentence recall: A closer
look
Experiment 3 showed that a concurrent task specifically interfered with the maintenance of sentences that
were unrelated in meaning, indicating a special role for
attention in the binding of arbitrary combinations. The
secondary task effect did not generalise to the recall of
related sentences that formed a story, suggesting that
the processes which elevated sentence span above word
span (for example, the integration of different linguistic
codes; semantically and syntactically guided chunking)
were not themselves disrupted by divided attention. If
this interpretation is correct, the concurrent task might
be expected to cause forgetting of entire sentences in
the absence of a story structure. To address this issue,
each sentence that was presented to an individual subject

E. Jefferies et al. / Journal of Memory and Language 51 (2004) 623-643

was classified as having been recalled entirely correctly,
partially or not at all. The secondary task reduced the
number of correctly recalled sentences (Experiment 1:
F(1, 23) = 4.55, p < .05; Experiment 2: F(1, 23) = 8.23,
p < .01; and Experiment 3: F(1, 23) = 3.02, p < .1) apparently due to an increase in the number of sentences that
were entirely forgotten (Experiment 1: F(1, 23) = 3.26,
p = .08; Experiment 2: F(1, 23) = 14.83, p < .001; and
Experiment 3: F(1, 23) = 2.70, p = .11). There was no
influence of the secondary task on the percentage of
sentences that were partially recalled (Experiment 1:
F(1, 23) = 2.26, p = .15; and Experiment 2: F(1, 23)
< 1; and Experiment 3: F(1, 23) = 2.02, p = .17). In the
third experiment, the unrelated sentence and story conditions did not differ in terms of either completely correct or partial sentence recall (F(1, 23) = 2.80, p = .11
and 2.05, p = .17); however, unrelated sentences were
more likely to be completely forgotten than those from
stories (F(1, 23) = 5.82, p < .05). These findings are consistent with the view that the recall of unrelated sentences is particularly sensitive to the effects of a
concurrent task because divided attention disrupts the
maintenance of several unrelated chunks.

General discussion
Three experiments examined the effect of a concurrent attention-demanding visual choice reaction time
(CRT) task on the recall of auditorily presented stories,
sentences, and lists of unrelated words, in order to examine the relative importance of controlled and automatic
encoding processes for retention of these materials. List
length was based on span for each participant and for
each type of material, with the aim of equating recall under single task conditions. The pattern across the experiments was that on Trial 1, retention of words and
unrelated sentences was equivalent when attention was
undivided; when participants performed the CRT task
concurrently however, the retention of sentences was
markedly impaired whereas the retention of the unrelated words was relatively unaffected. In contrast to
the findings for unrelated sentences, the secondary task
had little effect on the recall of related sentences that
formed a story (Experiment 3), suggesting that the processes that underlie the span advantage for sentences relative to words (for example, semantically/syntactically
guided chunking and the integration of different linguistic codes) can operate relatively automatically. These
processes are likely to play a larger role in the recall of
stories than unrelated sentences (given that the meaningfulness of stories should encourage the formation of larger chunks) and yet the secondary task only impaired
recall of the latter material. The dual task decrement
for sentential material (composed of several short sentences) was affected by the semantic relatedness of the

639

sentences, suggesting that divided attention interfered
with the ability to form links between arbitrary combinations of sentences (reducing the number of unrelated
sentence chunks that participants were able to maintain
simultaneously) rather than interfering with the process
of within-sentence chunking per se.
Different types of errors occurred on the word and
sentence span tasks, lending support to the notion of
coding differences between the materials. Phonological
errors were more frequent on the word lists and semantic errors were more frequent on the sentences, suggesting a greater involvement of phonological coding in
word span and semantic coding in sentence span
(Baddeley, 1966b; Conrad, 1964). There were also fewer
order and morphological errors on the sentences, presumably because the sentence structure constrained
both the order and the morphological marking of the
words. In Experiment 2, the concurrent task influenced
order memory for unrelated words but not sentences, in
line with the view that controlled processing comes into
play when arbitrary associations must be maintained,
but this finding did not replicate across the
experiments.
Over three trials in which the same material was repeated, the sentences were learned more quickly than
the word lists. In addition, the concurrent reaction time
task impaired the retention of unrelated words to a
greater extent after they had been presented several
times, suggesting that attention-demanding encoding
processes made a more substantial contribution to word
recall as learning increased. With multiple presentations,
participants may have switched from using predominately phonological encoding (which is likely to be relatively ineffective but have a low attentional cost) to the
formation of multiword chunks; this would have enhanced recall considerably in the single task condition
but would have increased participantsO vulnerability to
the effects of divided attention.
As the amount of material to be remembered was increased above span (Experiment 2), percentage recall declined less rapidly for sentences than for word lists. The
greater involvement of long-term semantic/syntactic representations in the sentence span task presumably made
WM for this material more robust to supra span increases in length. Word span may have been less robust
because of its greater reliance on the limited capacity
phonological loop. The retention of longer lengths of
material was relatively unaffected by conditions of divided attention, possibly because participants were less
likely to use attention-demanding strategies when the
task was very taxing. In addition, the semantic/syntactic
factors which underpinned the more substantial sentence
recall advantage at longer list lengths were apparently
operating largely automatically; consequently, at longer
lengths, controlled processing may have played a relatively minor role in sentence recall.

Reaction times on the CRT task were consistent with
this pattern. RT was similar for the words and unrelated
sentences on the first trial, suggesting that the larger dual
task decrement in retention observed for sentences did
not result from a trade-off in memory and RT performance. The dual task decrement for unrelated sentences
manifested itself in memory performance rather than in
RT, in line with the results of Craik et al. (1996) who
found that performing an RT task during encoding
had a substantial effect on recall but a smaller effect on
RT. RT was slower for unrelated sentences than for stories, even though stories were recalled more accurately,
suggesting that the sentences were more effortful to encode. Over three trials in which the same material was
repeated, RT increased for words but not sentences/stories. This finding is consistent with the greater dual task
decrement in retention observed for word lists on later
trials and again suggests that attention-demanding
encoding processes played a greater role in the word
span task as learning increased.
In summary, we have obtained evidence for a large
role of automatic linguistic knowledge effects in sentence/prose recall, as well as a significant attentional
contribution to the retention of unrelated chunks of
information. The finding that the dual task decrement
for unrelated sentences did not generalise to the recall
of stories revealed that sentences/stories activate pre-existing semantic and syntactic representations in LTM
relatively automatically as they are processed; word
lists cannot activate these representations to the same
extent, accounting for the span advantage for prose.
This type of automatic support for sentences is envisaged by connectionist models that view verbal STM
as arising directly from the representations involved
in language processing (MacDonald & Christiansen,
2002; Martin & Saffran, 1992, 1997; Martin, Saffran,
& Dell, 1996).
Divided attention interfered with the ability to rapidly form links between arbitrary combinations of sentences, reducing the number of unrelated sentences
that participants were able to maintain simultaneously,
but did not interfere with processes such as (1) syntactic
parsing or (2) the creation of mental representations of
sentence meaning. There is some convergent evidence
to suggest that these processes operate relatively automatically. (1) Waters, Caplan, & Rochon (1995) found
that divided attention impaired comprehension of sentences that contained a large number of propositions,
but did not impair syntactically complex sentences to a
greater extent than simple ones. In addition, patients
with AlzheimerOs disease who have executive deficits
are largely unimpaired at comprehending syntactically
complex sentences but show greater difficulty for sentences containing multiple propositions (Kempler, Almor, Tyler, Andersen, & MacDonald, 1998; Rochon,
Waters, & Caplan, 1994, 2000; Waters et al., 1995;

Waters & Rochon, 1998). It seems, therefore, that syntactic parsing is relatively automatic, whereas the maintenance/binding of several different propositions is
effortful. Although we did not systematically manipulate
number of propositions in the current study, the concepts in the unrelated sentence condition were more diverse than those in the stories. (2) Recent research
suggests that the construction of models of sentence
meaning proceeds relatively automatically. Radvansky
& Copeland (2004) found that demanding WM span
tasks did not predict participantsO abilities to process
the meaning of prose as measured by, for example, the
detection of narrative inconsistencies. Interestingly,
WM span did correlate with the ability to remember
information that was poorly integrated into the story
as a whole. In addition, mental model construction does
not decline with age, despite older adultsO poorer attentional control (Radvansky, 1999; Radvansky, Copeland,
Berish, & Dijkstra, 2003; Radvansky, Zwaan, Curiel, &
Copeland, 2001). However, older adults do show specific
difficulty in retrieving nonintegrated facts (Radvansky,
Zacks, & Hasher, 1996). These studies are consistent with
our results suggesting that attention is critical for the
encoding of unrelated sentences but not stories.
The differential role of attention in sentence and
story recall is coherent with CowanOs (2000) suggestion
of a basic capacity limitation of four unrelated chunks
that can be held in the focus of attention at any one
time: conditions of divided attention might be expected
to reduce this capacity, preventing participants from
forming new associations between unrelated sentences,
and causing them to forget entire sentences. In contrast, retention of the stories may have been less reliant
on the capacity to maintain several unrelated chunks
because the meaningfulness of this material would have
encouraged the formation of larger chunks, potentially
spanning several sentences. It is also interesting to note
the implications of these findings for the LT-WM model of Ericsson & Kintsch (1995). In some situations in
which LT-WM is used, such as digit recall by memory
experts, meaning is effortfully imposed on arbitrary
strings of items in order to increase their memorability:
this may be analogous to our participantsO efforts to
remember sequences of unrelated sentences. However,
it appears that the recall of coherent prose does not
rely on exactly the same processes despite the involvement of LT-WM (see Miyake & Shah, 1999; for a similar suggestion).
Why did the secondary task have little impact on
word recall on the first trial, since these items were also
unrelated in meaning? One possibility is that the specific conditions in the experiments (fast presentation
speed and a relatively high proportion of function
words with few semantic associations) encouraged the
participants to rely primarily on a phonological code
to retain the word lists; in contrast, span for the sen-

E. Jefferies et al. / Journal of Memory and Language 51 (2004) 623-643

tence material extended far beyond the capacity of the
phonological loop. As the words in the lists were unrelated in meaning, chunk size is likely to have been
small and thus recall may not have been profoundly
affected by chunk capacity. Although across the
experiments, dual task interference effects broadly
followed the pattern unrelated sentences > unrelated
words > stories, it is important to note that in Experiment 3, the difference between the first two materials
did not reach significance: the concurrent task may
therefore have had a marginal effect on the retention
of unrelated words. It would be interesting to establish
whether divided attention has a more substantial effect
on the recall of novel word lists that contain several
semantically related clusters of words. Semantic grouping is expected to increase word span beyond the
capacity of the phonological loop (Poirier & Saint Aubin, 1995) and in these circumstances, recall may be
more reliant on the ability to maintain several unrelated chunks (in this case, groups of semantically related words). Whatever the role of attention in word
span tasks, our findings suggest that for sentential
material, attention-demanding processes are involved
in the formation of links between, or simultaneous
maintenance of, unrelated concepts/propositions but
that there is also a major contribution from syntactic/
semantic factors that operates relatively automatically.
