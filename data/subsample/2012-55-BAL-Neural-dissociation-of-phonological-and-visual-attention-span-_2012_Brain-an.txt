a b s t r a c t
A dissociation between phonological and visual attention (VA) span disorders has been reported in dyslexic children. This study investigates whether this cognitively-based dissociation has a neurobiological
counterpart through the investigation of two cases of developmental dyslexia. LL showed a phonological
disorder but preserved VA span whereas FG exhibited the reverse pattern. During a phonological rhyme
judgement task, LL showed decreased activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus whereas this region was
activated at the level of the controls in FG. Conversely, during a visual categorization task, FG demonstrated decreased activation of the parietal lobules whereas these regions were activated in LL as in
the controls. These contrasted patterns of brain activation thus mirror the cognitive disorders' dissociation. These findings provide the first evidence for an association between distinct brain mechanisms and
distinct cognitive deficits in developmental dyslexia, emphasizing the importance of taking into account
the heterogeneity of the reading disorder.

1. Introduction
The heterogeneity of the dyslexic population is widely recognized and leads to look for dyslexia subtypes and their specificities. Subtyping is required to reduce the heterogeneity and define
more homogeneous groups of participants with developmental
dyslexia. It should allow the identification of distinct subgroups
characterized by different cognitive disorders and different neurobiological dysfunctions. However, previous subtyping attempts
inspired by dual route models of reading (Coltheart, Curtis,
Atkins, & Haller, 1993; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler,
2001) have defined subtypes based upon dissociations between
reading patterns. Two subtypes, phonological and surface dyslexia,
respectively reflecting dissociations between irregular word and
pseudo-word reading, have been reported both in single-case
studies (e.g., Campbell & Butterworth, 1985; Castles & Coltheart,
1996; Dubois, Lafaye de Micheaux, Noel, & Valdois, 2007; Hanley
& Gard, 1995; Howard & Best, 1996; Valdois et al., 2003) and
group studies (for a review, Sprenger-Charolles, Siegel, Jimenez,

& Ziegler, 2011). However, while single-case studies of phonological dyslexia reported associations between phonological disorders (mainly poor phoneme awareness) and a selective deficit
in pseudo-word reading, most studies failed to identify any
consistent cognitive disorder for the surface dyslexia subtype
(see however, Dubois et al., 2007; Valdois et al., 2003). Moreover,
although some group studies supported poorer phoneme awareness skills in the phonological subtype (Manis, Seidenberg, Doi,
McBride-Chang, & Peterson, 1996; Stanovitch, Siegel, & Gottardo,
1997), others reported a similar phoneme awareness disorder in
both the phonological and surface dyslexia subtypes (SprengerCharolles, Cole, Lacert, & Serniclaes, 2000; Ziegler et al., 2008).
It was further found that most dyslexic individuals exhibited a
mixed reading profile characterized by poor irregular word and
pseudo-word reading. Accordingly, the classification of dyslexic
children into discrete subgroups resulted in a poor description
of the whole dyslexic population (Griffiths & Snowling, 2002).
In fact, dissociating reading profiles into phonological and surface
did not allow identifying distinct subtypes characterized by
distinct cognitive deficits. Subtyping attempts based on reading
patterns rather supported a unitary account of developmental
dyslexia as originating from an underlying phonological
impairment.

1.1. A phonological impairment at the core of developmental dyslexia
It is widely admitted that developmental dyslexia is a languagebased disorder (Bishop & Snowling, 2004; Snowling, 2008) characterized by difficulties in phonological processing (Frith, 1997;
Ramus & Szenkovits, 2008; Ramus et al., 2003; Snowling, 2001;
for a review, Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, 2004) that
hamper grapheme-phoneme mapping acquisition. The phonological disorder is thus expected to primarily impact pseudo-word
reading which directly relies on knowledge of grapheme-phoneme
correspondences. Interestingly, a single phonological disorder
might further account for mixed reading profiles in developmental
dyslexia. Indeed, the self-teaching hypothesis assumes that phonological decoding skills are necessary for orthographic lexical
knowledge build-up (Share, 1995, 1999). It has been further
hypothesized that, at least in more transparent languages than
English, surface dyslexia might occasionally occur in the context
of a phonological disorder, as the outcome of an initially mixed
reading profile but acquisition of recoding skills due to extensive
training (Ziegler et al., 2008). Theoretically, a single phonological
disorder might therefore account for the variety of reading patterns that have been reported in participants with developmental
dyslexia.
Beyond behavioral data, substantial evidence has established
the neurobiological origin of developmental dyslexia (see Demonet, Taylor, and Chaix (2004) or Pernet, Anderson, Paulesu, and
Demonet (2009) for reviews). Neuroimaging studies have repeatedly reported atypical activation of the left perisylvian fronto-
temporo-parietal network in adults with developmental dyslexia
as compared to controls. This network consists of three main areas:
the inferior frontal gyrus (mainly Broca's area BA 44/45), the inferior occipital-temporal area (BA 37 or visual word form area -
VWFA) and the parietal/temporal regions (BA 22, 39, 40). Temple
(2002) reviewed studies that used positron emission tomography
or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate
phonological processing in participants with developmental dyslexia (see also Eden & Zeffiro, 1998). The same three regions were
typically characterized by atypical activation when dyslexic individuals are engaged in tasks requiring phonological processing
such as rhyme judgment or sub-lexical sound deletion tasks. More
specifically, decreased fMRI activation was reported in the left
temporo-parietal cortex during phonological processing (Aylward
et al., 2003; Paulesu, Demonet, Fazio, et al., 2001; Rumsey et al.,
1992; Simos et al., 2000). Similar dysfunction has been consistently
found in the left inferior frontal cortex (including Broca's area)
although results are not consensual since either increased activity
(Brunswick, McCrory, Price, Frith, & Frith, 1999; Shaywitz et al.,
1998), or decreased activity (Brunswick et al., 1999; Paulesu
et al., 2001) or activity occurring at an a priori unexpected location
in the brain (Temple et al., 2001) have been reported in dyslexic
individuals. It was further demonstrated that a phonology-based
reading intervention led to increased activation in the left inferior
frontal gyrus and in the left temporo-parietal region (Eden et al.,
2004; Shaywitz et al., 2004; Temple et al., 2003). In contrast and
despite being activated during phonological processing tasks using
visual inputs, the left inferior occipito-temporal area (or VWFA) is
thought to be preferentially involved in visual word recognition
and letter string processing (Cohen et al., 2000, 2002; Gaillard
et al., 2006) and has been primarily described as a visual unimodal
area (Cohen & Dehaene, 2004).
1.2. A visual processing disorder in developmental dyslexia?
Although developmental dyslexia is classically interpreted as
resulting from a core phonological deficit, visual and visual attention processing deficits have also been reported in children with

specific reading acquisition disorders (Boden & Giaschi, 2007; Vidyasagar & Pammer, 2010). Most of these deficits have been linked
to functional abnormalities of the magnocellular visual system
(Stein, 2003, for a review). However, these low level disorders
and attentional impairments were found to typically co-occur with
phonological problems and correlate with pseudo-word reading
performance (Facoetti et al., 2010; Witton et al., 1998) so that
the phonological disorder remained as the most plausible proximal
cause of the poor reading outcome of dyslexic readers (Ramus
et al., 2003).
However, evidence that a visual attention (VA) span dysfunction can dissociate from phonological problems in some children
with developmental dyslexia opens new perspectives for the research on dyslexia subtypes. The visual attention (VA) span disorder was defined as a limitation in the number of discrete visual
elements which can be processed in parallel in a visual display.
Bosse, Tainturier, and Valdois (2007) demonstrated that a substantial number of dyslexic children exhibited a single VA span disorder that was related to reading performance independently of
the child's phonological skills. Single-case studies further revealed
a VA span disorder in dyslexic individuals with preserved phonological skills (Dubois et al., 2007; Lassus-Sangosse, N'Guyen-Morel,
& Valdois, 2008; Valdois et al., 2003; Valdois et al., 2011) whereas
other dyslexic individuals reversely showed preserved VA span
abilities in the context of impaired phonological skills (Lallier,
Donnadieu, Berger, & Valdois, 2010). The independence between
VA span abilities and phonological processing skills was further
supported by a study conducted on large samples of typically
developing children from first to fifth grade, in which strong evidence was provided for a specific link between VA span development and learning to read (Bosse & Valdois, 2009). In line with
the multi-trace memory model of reading (Ans, Carbonnel, &
Valdois, 1998), these findings suggest that in addition to phonological abilities, the VA span plays a significant role in the acquisition
of reading skills and developmental dyslexia.
Within this framework, a VA span disorder is primarily expected to impact irregular word reading, so that a surface-like reading profile would arise whenever the VA span is reduced enough to
hamper the entire letter sequence of most words to be processed in
a single step (Valdois, Bosse, & Tainturier, 2004). Accordingly, cases
of dyslexic children with a single VA span disorder have been reported in the context of a reading pattern of surface dyslexia (Dubois et al., 2010; Valdois et al., 2003). However, analytic processing
also requires the VA span to be large enough to process in parallel
all the letters of relevant orthographic units (such as multi-letter
graphemes or syllables). It follows that a VA span impairment
might further prevent normal processing of relevant orthographic
units within strings, thus resulting in a mixed dyslexia reading profile (Valdois et al., 2011). A VA span disorder might thus be found
in association with a surface or mixed reading pattern in children
who show no associated phonological problems.
To investigate the neural underpinnings of the VA span, an fMRI
study was conducted - using a visual flanked categorization task
(inspired from Pernet, Valdois, Celsis, & Demonet, 2006) which required character string processing but no verbal response - in a
homogeneous group of dyslexic children with a VA span disorder
but no phonological problem (Peyrin, Demonet, N'guyen-Morel,
Le Bas, & Valdois, 2011). By comparison with the baseline (fixation
cross), the visual categorization task elicited activations within the
superior and inferior parietal regions bilaterally and in the left inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally, including the VWFA. The extrastriate cortex bilaterally, and motor regions were further activated in
children who are normal readers. As compared to controls, dyslexic
children showed lower activation within the superior parietal lobule (BA7) bilaterally and the left supramarginal gyrus. When activations were contrasted during the flanked categorization task

C. Peyrin et al. / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 381-394

and a less-attention-demanding visual categorization control task,
activation of the left superior parietal lobule was significantly lower in the dyslexic children with a VA span disorder (Peyrin, Demonet, N'guyen-Morel, Le Bas, & Valdois, 2011). Similarly, a superior
parietal lobule dysfunction was found in young adults with developmental dyslexia when engaged in the letter report task typically
used to investigate VA span abilities at the behavioral level (Peyrin,
Lallier, & Valdois, 2008). Currently available data thus suggest that
a superior parietal lobule dysfunction (mainly in the left hemisphere) might characterize the subtype of dyslexic individuals with
an associated VA span disorder.
In sum, previous findings suggest that some dyslexic readers
suffer from a single VA span disorder while others exhibit a phonological impairment in the absence of VA span disorder. These cognitive disorders might further relate to different neurobiological
dysfunctions. Impaired phonological skills have been consistently
attributed to dysfunctions of a fronto-parietal network of the left
hemisphere including Broca's area and the temporo-parietal regions. In contrast, a VA span disorder might more specifically relate
to a superior parietal lobule dysfunction. However, previous studies did not provide any evidence for a dissociation between these
two brain regions in developmental dyslexia.
1.3. Purpose of the current study
The present study investigates the cerebral substrates of developmental dyslexia in two cases of highly educated young adults
who demonstrated a dissociation regarding phonological and VA
span deficits at the behavioral level. Under fMRI recording, the
two participants were presented with a rhyme judgement task tapping into phonological processing skills and a visual categorization
task engaging VA span abilities. Data obtained on these neuroimaging experiments in the two dyslexic individuals were compared to
those obtained in normal readers during the same tasks. Inasmuch
as performing rhyming tasks elicits activations in the left inferior
frontal lobe and in the inferior parietal lobule (e.g., Billingsley,
McAndrews, Crawley, & Mikulis, 2001; Lurito, Kareken, Lowe,
Chen, & Mathews, 2000; Seghier et al., 2004) and following related
findings in developmental dyslexia (Booth et al., 2004; Paulesu
et al., 1996; Temple, 2002; Temple et al., 2001), specific functional
atypical activation were expected in these regions, more specifically in the left inferior frontal gyrus (including Broca's area) and
the left inferior parietal lobule, for the dyslexic participant with a
phonological disorder. In contrast, preserved phonological skills
in the other dyslexic participant should result in normal activation
of the same fronto-parietal network.
Besides, assuming that the visual categorization task primarily
elicites activations within the superior and inferior parietal regions
in children who are normal readers and on the basis of data showing that a left superior parietal lobule dysfunction is observed in
children with a VA span disorder (Peyrin, Demonet, N'guyenMorel, Le Bas, & Valdois, 2011), we expected the dyslexic participant with a VA span disorder to exhibit decreased activation
within the superior parietal lobules. Normal superior parietal
lobule activation was in contrast expected in the participant who
showed preserved VA span but a phonological disorder.
2. Participants
Fourteen healthy skilled readers (seven female, seven male;
mean age  SD = 28.1  4.6) and two dyslexic young adults participated in this study. All participants were right-handed native
French speakers, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and
no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. None of the
skilled readers reported any learning impairment for reading or
spelling and none of them complained of difficulties during their

383

academic years. All participants were graduate students in psychology at the University of Grenoble. They gave their informed
written consent for participating in the study that was approved
by the local ethics committee.
One of the two dyslexic participants, LL, a 35 years old female
was a highly educated dyslexic who graduated in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Grenoble. She was research assistant
at the time of testing but naive with respect to the purpose and
background of the current research.1 The second dyslexic participant, FG, was a 22 years old graduate student in Computer Engineering. None of them reported any history of neurological or psychiatric
illness, or any severe problems in speech language development.
Hearing and visual acuity were found to be normal in both of them.
They both received conventional reading instruction when attending
primary school. FG and LL never repeated a grade but were both considered as slow readers during schooling period. FG received special
help for his reading/spelling difficulties from Grades 2-5 and during
highschool years. LL received neither special help nor remediation
for her reading difficulties. The two dyslexic participants had similar
socio-economic backgrounds.
The average scores of non-verbal IQ assessed with the Raven
Standard Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1998; mean = 54.2;
SD = 3.8) were within the normal range for the two dyslexic participants: 54 and 56 for LL and FG respectively. Moreover, they performed similarly well on the Complex Rey Figure Test, which
requires reproducing a complex geometric figure from memory
and is typically used to assess perceptive, memory, and attention
skills. The two dyslexic participants exhibited good planning skills
for the reproduction of the 36 elements composing the figure
(scores 36/36 for the two participants; LL speed = 10 51, FG
speed = 20 08, both within the normal range). On the ``Alouette
Reading Test'' (Lefavrais, 1965), a standardized reading test for
assessing text reading fluency and accuracy in French, LL and FG
achieved a similar reading age of 10 years 11 months and 10 years
10 months respectively, demonstrating the persistence of severe
reading difficulties.
3. Neuropsychological assessment
Because standardized tests for the neuropsychological assessment of young adults are not available in French, the two participants were given original tasks designed for the purpose of the
current study. Their reading and spelling abilities were assessed together with their phonological and VA span skills. Performance on
the neuropsychological tasks was compared to that of 20 chronological-age-matched skilled readers. For each task, modified t-tests
(Crawford & Howell, 1998) were carried out to compare the performance of each dyslexic participant with that of the control group.
3.1. Reading
3.1.1. Material
Reading abilities were assessed using two lists of 40 irregular
words and 40 pseudo-words. Words and pseudo-words were displayed in columns (lower case, Tahoma 14) and presented on separate sheets. The participants were instructed of the nature of the
items beforehand and asked to read them aloud as quickly and
accurately as possible. Both reading accuracy and reading rate (total time needed to read the entire list) were taken into account. The
two participants were also administered a grapheme-to-phoneme
conversion task in which they were asked to sound out 51 French
graphemes. Results are provided in Table 1.

LL sequential processing skills have been investigated in both the auditory and
visual modalities. Results are reported in Lallier et al. (2010).

3.1.2. Results
As shown in Table 1 and in comparison to the control group,
both dyslexic participants demonstrated very good knowledge of
grapheme-to-phoneme mappings (t(19) = 1.14, p > 0.05 for LL and
t(19) = 0.23, p > 0.05 for FG). LL did not show any specific reading
difficulty for irregular reading speed (t(19) = 1.30, p > 0.05) or
accuracy (t(19) = .60, p > 0.05). She also read pseudo-words as well
as her control peers (t(19) = 0.33, p > 0.05) although at a slower
rate (t(19) = 2.33, p < 0.05). LL performance thus suggests poor
reading skills affecting pseudo-word reading selectively. In contrast, FG showed significant reading difficulties on both irregular
word and pseudo-word reading lists. For irregular word reading,
his results demonstrated a poor performance regarding accuracy
(t(19) = 1.90, p < 0.05) and a slow reading speed (t(19) = 3.97,
p < 0.001). His decoding skills were also strongly impaired, as illustrated by a significantly lower score (t(19) = 7.77, p < 0.001) and
slower reading speed (t(19) = 2.97, p < 0.01) when processing pseudo-words. A qualitative analysis of FG's reading performance revealed a high proportion of regularisation errors (86%) when
attempting to read irregular words. As for pseudo-words, FG's errors mostly (60%) resulted from confusions between visually similar letters (a/o; p/b; p/d; g/q), and grapheme parsing errors. In this
later case, a complex multi-letter grapheme (``OIN'' and ''EIM'') was
segmented into two existing but shorter graphemes (e.g., the
pseudoword ``toinpare'' was rendered as /to/-/in/-/par/, thus resulting from the erroneous parsing of the ``OIN'' grapheme as ``O'' and
``IN''). FG's reading errors were not phonologically based, i.e.,
resulting from confusions between voiced and voiceless consonants, except for a unique p/b confusion that involved two graphemes which are both visually and phonologically similar.
3.2. Spelling
3.2.1. Material
LL and FG were asked to write down 80 words and 40 pseudowords pronounced by the experimenter. The word list was com-

posed of 40 regular words (e.g., /kameRa/ ? camera; /dRam/ ?
drame) and 40 irregular words which included one or several
phonemes associated to relatively infrequent graphemes (e.g., /
arne/ ? harnais, /solanel/ ? solennel; /kwan/ ? couenne). The
regular and irregular words were matched in length and frequency.
Pseudo-words were legal items varying in length from five to eight
phonemes (two to four syllables). The items were pronounced one
at a time with no repetition.
3.2.2. Results
As shown in Table 1, LL's spelling performance did not differ significantly from that of the skilled readers regarding real words,
whatever their regularity (t(19) = 0.33, p > 0.05 and t(19) = 1.41,
p > 0.05 for the consistent and inconsistent words respectively).
She however performed well below the norm on pseudo-word
spelling (t(19) = 2.42, p < 0.05). In contrast, FG showed a selective
and significant word spelling impairment illustrated by a lower
performance than the controls on both the consistent
(t(19) = 1.72, p < 0.05) and inconsistent words (t(19) = 3.09,
p < 0.01), in absence of any spelling deficit for pseudo-words
(t(19) = 1.33, p > 0.05).
3.3. Phonological skills
3.3.1. Material
The phonological abilities of the two dyslexic participants were
assessed using three original tasks including a phonological shortterm memory task (pseudo-word repetition), and two phoneme
awareness tasks (phoneme segmentation and spoonerisms).
Regarding phonological short-term memory, participants were
asked to repeat 92 pseudo-words which were pronounced one
after the other by the experimenter. The 92 items were derived
from real words by substituting the vowels (e.g., catastrophe ? cotastrephe; fraction ? froctien). Their length was varying
from one to four syllables and most of the items included a consonant cluster. Regarding phoneme awareness, the phoneme deletion

C. Peyrin et al. / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 381-394

task consisted in deleting one of the phonemes of a word and producing the resulting pseudo-word (e.g., /golf/ without /l/ says?).
Lastly, the spoonerism task required exchanging the first phoneme
of two words pronounced by the experiment one after the other
(e.g., mouton  tulipe ? touton  mulipe), which always resulted
in two pseudo-words. All words began with a singleton. Ten series
of two words made up of 4.8 phonemes on average (range 4-6)
were presented.
3.3.2. Results
As shown in Table 1, LL performed poorly on the three phonological tasks as compared to the control group. Although a deficit
was significant on the spoonerism task (t(19) = 5.22, p < 0.001)
and pseudo-word repetition (t(19) = 3.13, p < 0.01), her poor performance at segmenting phonemes did not reach significance
(t(19) = 1.62, p = 0.1). In contrast, FG demonstrated a well within-the-normal-range performance on the three phonological tasks
(all t values > 0.5, all ps > 0.7). Direct comparison of LL and FG
phoneme awareness skills was performed using Crawford's criteria
(Crawford, Garthwaite, & Wood, 2010). Results revealed that phonological performance of LL and FG significantly differed on the
more taxing spoonerism task (t(19) = 3.54, p = .001) but not on
the phoneme segmentation task (t(19) = 0.90, p = .19). The two
participants further differed in pseudo-word repetition
(t(19) = 2.03, p = .028).
3.4. Visual attention span
3.4.1. Material
Participants were presented with three tasks requiring global
and partial letter-string report similar as those previously used
by our team to assess VA span abilities in control and dyslexic children (Bosse et al., 2007; Prado, Dubois, & Valdois, 2007; Valdois
et al., 2003). For the purpose of the present study, these tasks were
adapted for the assessment of young adults (as in Lallier et al.
(2010)). In the three tasks, stimuli were random consonant strings
presented in upper-case with a black font color on a white background. Each trial began with the presentation of a central fixation
point for 1000 ms, then followed by a blank screen for 500 ms. The
consonant string was then briefly presented at the centre of the
screen, horizontally. In the five-letters global report task, the 20
letter strings (e.g., R H S D M) were displayed for 100 ms, immediately followed by a mask (a series of five asterisks). In the six-letters global report task, the 24 letter strings (e.g., B F D L S R) were
displayed for 200 ms without mask. In these two global report
tasks, participants had to recall as many letter names as possible
immediately after their presentation, with no order constraint. In
the partial report task, 72 six-letter strings were displayed for
200 ms without mask. At the offset of the letter string, the cue (a
vertical bar) was displayed for 50 ms under one the letter location
previously presented in the consonant string. Participants had to
report the letter that had been presented at the cue position. In
each of the three tasks, scores corresponded to the total number
of accurately reported letters.
3.4.2. Results
As shown in Table 1, LL scored well within the normal range on
the three VA span tasks (all t values > 0.9, all ps > 0.3). In contrast,
FG exhibited poor performance on the three tasks. More specifically, his performance was significantly lower than the controls
on the five-letters (t(19) = 3.97, p < 0.001) and six-letters
(t(19) = 2.88, p < 0.01) global report tasks. On the six-letters partial report task, FG's performance did not significantly differ from
the performance of the control group (t(19) = 1.33, p = 0.18). Direct comparison of LL and FG performance revealed that the two
dyslexic participants differed significantly on the global report

385

tasks of both five and six letters (t(19) = 2.08, p = .001;
t(19) = 1.87, p = .038) but showed similar performance on the less
taxing partial report task (t(19) = 0.39, p = .35).
3.5. Summary of the neuropsychological assessment
Neuropsychological assessment primarily revealed that LL and
FG exhibited a double dissociation in their phonological and VA
span skills. Although LL performed poorly on phonological shortterm memory and phoneme awareness tasks, she demonstrated
preserved performance on the report tasks assessing VA span abilities. In contrast, FG showed good phoneme awareness and phonological short-term memory skills but impaired performance on the
report tasks assessing VA span abilities. These two young adults
thus demonstrated distinct cognitive impairments associated with
a nonetheless similar poor reading level.
A dissociation was further showed regarding their pattern of
performance on spelling. Indeed, LL showed difficulties on pseudo-word spelling yet with preserved word spelling skills. On the
opposite, FG exhibited the reverse pattern illustrated by good
pseudo-word spelling skills but symptoms of degraded word specific orthographic lexical knowledge. LL and FG further demonstrated dissociated performance regarding word reading reflected
by poor irregular word reading, accuracy or speed in FG only. Lastly
and although both LL and FG showed poor pseudo-word reading
performance, specifics in their deficits remained different: LL
showed pseudo-word reading accuracy performance within the
norm but a slow reading speed, whereas FG was severely impaired
on both speed and accuracy when having to process pseudo-words.
Interestingly, poor reading accuracy and slow reading speed on
pseudo-words in FG was observed despite preserved phonological
skills. Such difficulties for pseudo-word processing was furthermore specific to the visual modality (i.e., observed in reading but
not in spelling)2 and resulted in visual and grapheme parsing errors,
well in accordance with his visual processing disorder.
4. Neuroimaging assessment
An fMRI study was conducted in order to identify the neurobiological correlates of LL and FG's cognitive disorders. Brain activity
was recorded while participants were engaged in two tasks of
rhyme detection and visual categorization. The rhyming task (a letter name rhyming task) was chosen because it has been proved to
be an easy task furthermore suitable for investigating phonological
processing skills in dyslexia. The flanked letter categorization task
was used because it is a good candidate to highlight the cerebral
correlates of the VA span.
4.1. FMRI experiments
4.1.1. Stimuli
For the rhyme detection task, stimuli were single lower-case
letters from the Latin alphabet (Courier new font) covering approximately 1 of visual angle (see Fig. 1a). Each single letter was displayed at the centre of the screen for 250 ms. For the flanked
categorization task, the set of stimuli included twelve upper-case
letters (A, E, F, G, H, M, N, P, Q, W, Y, Z) and four geometrical figures
(rectangle, trapezium, pentagon and parallelogram) covering
approximately 0.8 of visual angle. The stimuli were displayed by
pairs, consisting of either two letters (matched pair) or the combination of a letter and a geometrical figure (unmatched pair). For
2
A modified t-test analysis (Crawford & Howell, 1998) showed that the dissociation between his pseudo-word reading and spelling performance was significant
(p < 0.05).

displayed between stimuli in order to encourage participants to
maintain a central gaze fixation. For each functional session, six
initial dummy scans were performed in order to stabilize the magnetic field. After dummies, 60 functional volumes were acquired
during each visual categorization session and 72 functional volumes during each rhyme detection session. The averaged interstimulus interval was of three seconds. Before the experiment, participants underwent a training session outside the scanner, with
stimuli differing from those used in functional sessions.

Fig. 1. Example of stimuli. (a) During the rhyme detection task, participants had to
decide whether the isolated printed letter rhymed with ``B'' in French. (b) During
the visual categorization task, they had to decide whether stimuli of a pair were of
the same category (i.e., two letters) or not.

each stimulus pair, one stimulus was displayed centrally and the
other was presented at a distance of 3 either in the right (RVF)
or left (LVF) visual field. The later stimulus was flanked by two
`Xs' (see Fig. 1b). Each pair was displayed for a brief period of
180 ms in order to avoid useful ocular saccades. Stimulus color
was white and the background color was black. E-prime (E-prime
Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, USA) was used to deliver the stimuli on a PC computer and stimuli were transferred into
the magnet by means of a video projector (Epson EMP 8200). The
projection screen was situated behind the magnet and participants
were able to perceive the visual information by reflection from a
mirror centered above their eyes.
4.1.2. Tasks
For the rhyme detection task, participants were instructed to
press a response key with the index of their dominant hand, only
when a letter rhymed with ``B'' (``true'' for the letters ``C'', ``D'',
``P'', ``T'' and ``V''). For the visual categorization task, participants
had to perform a categorical matching task. They were instructed
to stare at the central stimuli and press a response key with the index of their dominant hand, only when they noticed an unmatched
stimulus pair (e.g., a central letter and a lateralized geometrical figure, or the reverse).
4.1.3. Event-related fMRI experimental design
Pseudo-randomized event-related fMRI paradigms were used
optimizing the onset of each type of stimuli (Friston, Zarahn, Josephs, Henson, & Dale, 1999). Each participant performed 4 erfMRI consecutive sessions split up between two sessions for the
rhyme detection task and two for the visual categorization task.
The order of the tasks and fMRI sessions within experiments was
counterbalanced across participants. For each session of the rhyme
detection task, 28 stimuli were displayed: 24 non-rhyming stimuli
and four target rhyming stimuli. In addition, 32 null-events (eight
of them at the end of the session) were included in each session in
order to provide an appropriate baseline measure (Friston et al.,
1999). The total duration of each functional session was of 3 min.
For each session of visual categorization, 28 pairs of stimuli were
displayed: 12 matched letter pairs in the LVF, 12 matched letter
pairs in the RVF, two target unmatched pairs in the LVF and two target unmatched pairs in the RVF. In addition, 22 null-events (10 of
them at the end of the session) were included. The total duration
of each functional visual categorization session was of 2.5 s. The
number of items requiring a motor response was minimized (four
items only per session) and brain activity was only considered for
the no-go trials. The few trials with a motor response play the role
of catch trials, allowing estimating participants' engagement in the
tasks.
During each functional session, null-events consisted of a black
screen followed by a white fixation dot covering 0.1 of visual angle displayed at the centre of the screen. This central dot was also

4.1.4. MR acquisition
A whole-body 3T MR scanner was used (Bruker MedSpec S300)
with 41 mT/m maximum gradient strength and 120 mT/m/s maximum slew rate. For functional scans, the manufacturer-provided
gradient-echo/T2 weighted EPI method was used. Forty-one adjacent axial slices parallel to the bi-commissural plane were acquired
in interleaved mode. Slice thickness was 3.5 mm. The in-plane voxel size was 3  3 mm (216  216 mm field of view acquired with a
72  72 pixels data matrix; reconstructed with zero filling to
128  128 pixels). The main sequence parameters were:
TR = 2.5 s, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 80. To correct images for geometric distortions induced by local B0-inhomogeneity, a B0 fieldmap was obtained from two gradient echo data sets acquired
with a standard 3D FLASH sequence (DTE = 9.104 ms). The fieldmap was subsequently used during data processing. Finally, a T1weighted high-resolution three-dimensional anatomical volume
was acquired, by using a sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid
acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (field of view =
256  224  176 mm; resolution: 1.333  1.750  1.375 mm;
acquisition matrix: 192  128  128 pixels; reconstruction matrix:
256  128  128 pixels).
4.1.5. Data processing
Data analysis was performed using the general linear model
(Friston et al., 1995) as implemented in SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) where each event is modeled using a hemodynamic
function model. Data analysis started by applying several spatial
pre-processing steps. First, functional volumes were time-corrected with the twentieth slice as reference, in order to correct effects caused by the different acquisition time of each slice.
Subsequently, all volumes were realigned to correct head motion
using rigid body transformations. The first volume of the first
ER-fMRI session was taken as reference volume. Unwarping was
performed using the individually acquired fieldmaps to correct
for interactions between head movements and EPI distortions
(Andersson, Hutton, Ashburner, Turner, & Friston, 2001). T1weighted anatomical volume was co-registered to mean images
created by the realignment procedure and was normalized to the
MNI space using a trilinear interpolation. The anatomical normalization parameters were subsequently used for the normalization
of functional volumes. Finally, each functional volume was
smoothed by an 8-mm Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)
Gaussian kernel. Time series for each voxel were high-pass filtered
(1/128 Hz cut-off) to remove low-frequency noise and signal drift.
After these pre-processing steps, statistical analysis was performed on functional images for each task separately. For the
rhyme detection task, two conditions (non rhyme, rhyme) were
modeled as two regressors convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF).3 For the categorization task, four
3
Since the pseudo-randomized ER-fMRI paradigms used in the present study
optimized the onset of each type of stimuli, i.e., interest trials but also catch trials,
catch trials were included as regressors in the statistical analysis even if they
represented only four trials per session. Note that the same results were obtained
when excluding catch trials from regressors.

387

C. Peyrin et al. / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 381-394

conditions (Flanked-LVF matched, Flanked-LVF unmatched, FlankedRVF matched, Flanked-RVF unmatched) were modeled as four
regressors convolved with HRF.3 Movement parameters derived
from realignment corrections (three translations and three rotations)
were also entered in the design matrix of each experiment as additional factors. The general linear model was then used to generate
parameter estimates of activity at each voxel, for each condition,
and each participant. Statistical parametric maps were generated
from linear contrasts between the HRF parameter estimates for the
different experimental conditions. At the individual level, we assessed for all participants the whole network of cerebral areas involved in each task (rhyme detection and categorization task) by
contrasting interest conditions (rhyme and flanked parafoveal stimuli, respectively) to the baseline (fixation cross). We then identified
the brain correlates associated with phonological processing and
the VA span in skilled readers by performing a random-effect group
analysis on the contrast images from the individual analyses of
skilled readers (Friston et al., 1998), using one-sample t-tests. We
identified the brain correlates of phonological and VA span processes
in LL and FG based on the individual analysis performed in each case.
Clusters of activated voxels were then identified, based on the amplitude of the individual BOLD signal responses (P < 0.0001 uncorrected
for multiple comparisons). Only the clusters that were composed of
at least 50 adjacent voxels and that were statistically significant at
P < 0.05 volume-corrected were retained. We also performed a fixed

effect analysis on the two dyslexic readers (threshold P < 0.0001
uncorrected for multiple comparisons, extend threshold of five voxels) in order to estimate the cerebral activation specifically disturbed
in LL (relative to FG) during phonological processing and in FG (relative to LL) during visual attentional processing. For this purpose, we
specified the following contrasts: [LL_rhyme > FG_rhyme] and
[FG_rhyme > LL_rhyme] for the rhyme detection task; [LL_flanked > FG_flanked] and [FG_flanked > LL_flanked] for the visual categorization task. Brain regions were reported according to the
stereotaxic atlas of Talairach and Tournoux (1988).
Analysis was finally completed by statistically comparing
each patient data with the data of skilled readers within regions of interest (ROIs) a priori selected. ROI-based analyses
were performed using predefined masks from the Wake Forest
University (WFU) PickAtlas (Maldjian, Laurienti, Kraft, & Burdette, 2003). ROI masks were created using jointly the Brodmann area (cytoarchitectonic) atlas and the automated
anatomical labeling atlas, which uses an anatomical parcellation
of the MNI MRI single-subject brain and sulcal boundaries to
define each anatomical volume. Parameter estimates of eventrelated responses were then extracted from these ROIs for each
participant. Finally, modified t-test analyses (Crawford & Howell, 1998) were carried out to compare the mean parameter
estimates of each dyslexic with that of the skilled reader control group.

T > 3.79 during visual categorization for dyslexics). For each cluster, the Talairach coordinates (x, y, z) of the peak and the spatial extent (k) are indicated.

4.2. Results
4.2.1. Rhyme detection task
Behavioral data recorded during the rhyme detection fMRI
acquisition showed that the two dyslexic participants were as
accurate as skilled readers at detecting the odd letters, thus showing that they were normally engaged in the task.
FMRI data acquired from skilled readers showed that the rhyme
detection task ([rhyme > baseline], see Table 2a and Fig. 2a) specifically activated a fronto-parietal network including the left inferior
frontal gyrus (IFG), the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and the left
angular gyrus (AG). The left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) was further activated. Like skilled readers, the activation network obtained for FG involved the left IFG and SMG (Fig. 2c) and other
regions listed in Table 2a.
For LL, the rhyme detection task (relative to baseline, see
Table 2a and Fig. 2b) activated the left superior temporal gyrus,
the left angular and the left inferior frontal/premotor cortex together with the bilateral inferior/middle temporal gyrus and left
precuneus. More interestingly, no activation of either the left IFG
or left SMG was observed either considering the statistical threshold used to identify clusters of activated voxels in the present study
(P < 0.0001 uncorrected), or a less restrictive threshold (P < 0.001
uncorrected). LL presented an additional activation of the right
ITG, which was also observed at an individual level in four healthy
skilled readers (P < 0.0001 uncorrected). None of the skilled readers showed an absence of activation of both the left IFG and left
SMG at either threshold.
Furthermore, the direct comparison between the two dyslexic
participants (fixed effect analysis performed on the two dyslexic
readers; [LL_rhyme > FG_rhyme] and [FG_rhyme > LL_rhyme] contrasts, Table 3) showed that FG exhibited stronger activation than
LL in the left IFG (Fig. 4a). Other areas were also more activated in
FG (bilateral primary motor cortex and premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, left SPL), possibly in relation with other processes involved in the task (e.g., motor response). Relative to FG, LL
exhibited stronger activation within the left superior temporal
gyrus (BA 22).

significant activation within the right parietal areas, indicated by arrows in the

participant did not show any significant activation in either the left inferior frontal
gyrus (BA 44/45) or the left supramarginal gyrus (BA 40). These two regions are
indicated by arrows in the figure.

Lastly, a ROI based analysis was performed, using predefined
masks from the ``WFU Pickatlas'' (Maldjian et al., 2003), to compare
each dyslexic participant to the control group on predefined and
standardized neuroanatomical areas. Based on skilled readers'
brain activation pattern during the rhyme detection task and our
a priori hypotheses of a decreased activation within the left IFG
and SMG for the dyslexic participant with a phonological disorder,
the following a priori cortical ROIs were investigated: left IFG, BA
44/45; left SMG, BA 40. The ROI analyses confirmed significantly
lower activation in LL than in the controls within the left IFG

(t(13) = 2.25, p < 0.05), but not within the left SMG (t(13) = 0.74,
p = 0.24). Importantly, the analysis confirmed that brain activation
patterns were similar in FG and the controls for both ROIs (left IFG:
t(13) = 0.13, p = 0.55; left SMG: t(13) = 1.15, p = 0.87).
4.2.2. Visual categorization task
Behavioral data recorded under fMRI showed that the two dyslexic participants were as prone as skilled readers to detect the unmatched pairs, thus demonstrating they were well engaged in the
categorization task.
FMRI data acquired from skilled readers showed that the visual
categorization task ([flanked > baseline], see Table 2b and Fig. 3a)
activated a large parieto-temporal network comprising the SPL
bilaterally, the left SMG, the left AG/MOG, the left ITG and fusiform
gyrus, the bilateral extrastriate visual cortex and the supplementary motor area. Similar to skilled readers, LL showed activation
of the bilateral SPL, the left SMG and AG (Table 2b, Fig. 3b), but also
activation of the right ITG. For FG, brain activation during the visual
categorization task (relative to baseline, see Table 2b and Fig. 3c)
was limited to the left ITG, left SPL and left AG. Left parietal activations (including SPL, AG and SMG) were less extensive for FG than
for the other participants (healthy readers: 247 voxels; LL:
189 voxels; FG: 66 voxels) and the right SPL was not activated in
FG neither at the statistical threshold of P < 0.0001 uncorrected,
nor at the less restrictive threshold of P < 0.001 uncorrected.
Comparison between the two dyslexic participants on the
[LL_flanked > FG_flanked] contrast (fixed effect analysis preformed
on the two dyslexic readers; see Table 3) showed lower activation
for FG than LL within the SPL bilaterally (Fig. 4b), the left SMG and
the right ITG, and other areas (listed Table 3) possibly in relation
with other processes involved in the task. The reverse [FG_flanked > LL_flanked] contrast showed stronger activation within the
posterior cingulate gyrus for FG.
As for the rhyme detection task, a ROI based analysis was additionally performed using predefined masks from the ``WFU Pickatlas'' (Maldjian et al., 2003) to compare each dyslexic participant to
the control group on predefined and standardized neuroanatomical areas. Based on skilled readers' results on the visual categorization task and our a priori hypotheses of a parietal lobule
dysfunction for the dyslexic participant with a VA span disorder,
the following a priori cortical ROIs were investigated: left SPL, BA
7; right SPL, BA 7; left SMG, BA 40. The ROI analyses confirmed significantly lower activation for FG than controls within the right SPL
(t(13) = 2.08, p < 0.05), the left SMG (t(13) = 2.33, p < 0.05) and

the left SPL marginally (t(13) = 1.69, p = 0.06). As previously observed in the voxel-based analysis, there was no significant difference between LL and controls within the left SPL (t(13) = 1.18,
p = 0.13), right SPL (t(13) = 0.87, p = 0.20) and left SMG
(t(13) = 0.83; p = 0.21).
5. Discussion
A large number of behavioral and neurobiological studies conducted in participants with developmental dyslexia showed an
association between phonological problems and dysfunctions of
left perisylvian regions involved in language and phonological processing (Demonet et al., 2004; Vellutino et al., 2004). However, recent findings suggest that a VA span disorder can occur regardless
of phonological problems in at least a subgroup of dyslexic individuals. Accordingly, double dissociation patterns have been reported
showing that some dyslexic children exhibit a VA span impairment
but preserved phonological skills while others show the reverse
pattern, namely typical VA span skills but impaired phonological
abilities (Bosse et al., 2007; Dubois et al., 2010; Lallier et al.,
2010; Prado et al., 2007; Valdois et al., 2003, 2011). Investigations
focusing on the nature of the neural bases of VA span impairments
highlighted abnormal activation of superior parietal regions, with a
preferential involvement of the left superior parietal lobule in
children with reduced VA span skills (Peyrin, Demonet, N'guyenMorel, Le Bas, & Valdois, 2011). However, the dyslexic children
assessed in the later study were not asked to perform additional
phonological tasks, making the data silent regarding potential dissociation between the neural mechanisms impaired in dyslexic
individuals with a single VA span disorder and those impaired in
dyslexic individuals exhibiting a single phonological impairment.
The present study conducted on two contrasted young adults with
developmental dyslexia provides a first step in attempting to highlight a relationship between distinct phonological and VA span
cognitive disorders and distinct neural dysfunctions in at least
some dyslexic individuals.
5.1. Dissociated phonological processing skills in LL and FG
Tasks of phoneme awareness and phonological short-term
memory were used to assess phonological skills in our two participants. In line with previous findings showing relationships between poor phoneme awareness and oral language disorders in
developmental dyslexia (Ramus et al., 2003; Snowling, 2008;

390

C. Peyrin et al. / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 381-394

Vellutino et al., 2004), LL showed poor performance in both phoneme awareness and phonological short-term memory, evidencing
a persistent phonological disorder. In line with such difficulties,
she further showed abnormally slow reading speed and poor spelling performance on pseudo-words. Her preserved performance on
pseudo-word reading accuracy is also in accordance with previous
data showing that French phonological dyslexic readers exhibit a
pervasive speed deficit but rather high reading accuracy on pseudo-words (Sprenger-Charolles et al., 2000). Very similar findings
have been reported in other languages, more transparent than English (in German: Landerl, Wimmer, & Frith, 1997; Wimmer, 1993;
in Italian: Zoccolotti et al., 1999; and in Norvegian: Lundberg &
Hoien, 1990), suggesting that the phonological deficit mainly manifests itself as slow pseudo-word reading speed in orthographies
consisting in relatively straightforward grapheme-phoneme
correspondences.
In contrast, FG performed well within the norm and well above
LL on the three phonological processing tasks. He showed very
good performance even in the spoonerism task, furthermore very
challenging for LL. FG thus exhibited preserved phonological skills
like other previous cases of developmental dyslexia described in
the literature (Bosse et al., 2007; Castles & Coltheart, 1996; Goulandris & Snowling, 1991; McCloskey & Rapp, 2000; Romani, Ward,
& Olson, 1999). Well in line with an absence of phonological difficulties, FG further showed good pseudo-word spelling, thus demonstrating preserved ability to parse auditory pseudo-words into
discrete phonemes and translate each phoneme into its corresponding grapheme. The use of a phonological strategy when reading and spelling irregular words was further supported by the
qualitative analysis of reading and spelling errors of FG. Nevertheless, observations for a poor pseudo-word reading performance in
this dyslexic participant might be interpreted as evidence going
against the idea of preserved phonological processing. It is however worth noting that although poor phonological processing is
expected to result in poor pseudo-word reading, some studies report that individuals showing difficulties in pseudo-word reading
do in some cases master phonological processing (Caccappolovan Vliet, Miozzo, & Stem, 2004; Tree & Kay, 2006; Valdois et al.,
2011). Moreover, FG exhibited normal pseudo-word processing
when his performance relied on phonological analysis of the inputs
whereas his performance was impaired when performance was
based upon visual processing of the inputs: such observations
would not be expected in the framework of a phonological disorder. In fact, evidence for a pseudo-word processing disorder restricted to the visual input condition (i.e., reading) and for
visually-based errors could rather reflect a visual processing
impairment, well in line with the letter string processing deficit
exhibited by FG.
Furthermore, it is rather unlikely that normal phonological processing performance in FG at the time of testing would have resulted from training during childhood. Indeed, it has been shown
that phoneme awareness deficits are persistent even in adults with
fairly high levels of word recognition skills (Bruck, 2002; Howard &
Best, 1996). Accordingly, FG should have performed poorly on at
least the most taxing phoneme awareness task if he was suffering
from a phonological disorder. Difficulties on pseudo-word spelling
following a primary phonological disorder would have further
been expected in FG, since poor pseudo-word spelling has been described as a persistent problem relevant to identify dyslexic individuals even when reading performance had improved with time
or remediation (Campbell & Butterworth, 1985; Howard & Best,
1996; Shaywitz & Shaywitz, 2005). In addition, although specific
phonological training might reasonably help normalizing performance - through high-level top-down control - in tasks that require explicit phonological processing, it seems rather unlikely
that explicit training would improve performance in implicit

phonological processing tasks such as pseudo-word repetition. Evidence of normal activation of the neural network involved in phonological processing in FG provides further evidence against the
hypothesis of a potential primary phonological disorder. Indeed,
atypical brain activation is thought to be more informative about
the underlying disorder than behavioral data (Wilkinson & Halligan, 2004). Accordingly, investigation of brain activity during phonological tasks is expected to reveal persistent atypical activation
of the phonological brain regions even in well-compensated adult
dyslexics who no longer differ from the control group in phonological performance. Therefore, and against what show the current
findings, a primary phonological disorder in FG should have resulted in persistent atypical activation of the left fronto-parietal
network implicated in phonological processing. Moreover and
although FG received some help for his reading/spelling disorder
during childhood, he never benefited from a systematic and intensive phonologically-based remediation program known to increase
brain activity in those regions involved in phonological processing
(Simos et al., 2002; Temple et al., 2003).
In summary, the present data suggest that LL but not FG suffered from a phonological disorder.
5.2. Dissociated visual attention span processing skills in LL and FG
The two dyslexic participants were further administered three
letter report tasks designed to assess their VA span abilities, thus
multi-element parallel visual processing skills (Bosse et al.,
2007). When compared to LL who performed well within-the-normal range or to the normal reading group, FG demonstrated poor
performance on the three tasks and was more specifically impaired
in the two global report tasks. Converging evidence of impaired
performance in tasks involving parallel visual string processing
has been already reported in developmental dyslexia on both verbal (Rutkowski, Crewther, & Crewther, 2003; Ziegler, Pech-Georgel,
Dufau, & Grainger, 2010) and non-verbal tasks (Jones, Branigan, &
Kelly, 2008; Pammer, Lavis, Hansen, & Cornelissen, 2004; Pammer
& Vidyasagar, 2005). Some apparently inconsistent results of normal multi-element string processing in developmental dyslexia
(e.g., Hawelka & Wimmer, 2008; Pitchford, Ledgeway, & Masterson,
2009) are not relevant for the current purpose as far as processing
was not time-constrained and consequently not restricted to parallel processing. Along the same lines, a VA span disorder is expected
to impact performance when processing requires spreading attentional resources across multiple elements but not when attention is
focused on a single target always occurring at the same predefined string position (as in Shovman and Ahissar (2006)).
It has been claimed that poor performance on letter report tasks
did not result from a visual processing deficit but from impaired visual-to-phonological code mapping, in line with the phonological
theory of developmental dyslexia (Hawelka & Wimmer, 2008; Ziegler et al., 2010). However, evidence against a phonological interpretation of poor performance in these tasks can be summarized
in three points: First, dyslexic children are impaired when the report task requires the parallel processing of the visual letters simultaneously presented but not when it requires processing the exact
same letters presented sequentially, which taxes similar phonological short-term memory as the ``simultaneous'' report task but
requires a single visual letter to be processed at a time (LassusSangosse, N'Guyen-Morel, & Valdois, 2008). Second, it has been
shown that performance in global report was only minimally affected by concurrent articulation (Scarborough, 1972; Valdois
et al., in press), against the idea of difficulties for on-line verbal
encoding. Third and lastly, Lobier, Zoubrinetzky, and Valdois
(2011) reported that dyslexic children with poor letter global
report performance further exhibited poor performance in a nonverbal visual categorization task triggering parallel processing of

C. Peyrin et al. / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 381-394

non verbal visual elements. Overall, these data point out a visual
parallel processing disorder in some dyslexic children, such as in
FG, who exhibited poor global report performance. It is noteworthy
that such a claim is supported by the neuroimaging data collected
in FG. Indeed, FG showed abnormal brain activity while performing
a visual categorization task that did not require any verbal encoding, or any verbal output or phonological processing. As a consequence, both atypical behavioral data obtained on the global
report task and atypical brain activation patterns observed during
the categorization task under fMRI support a visual processing disorder in FG.
As expected from the presence of a VA span disorder that primarily impacts normal processing of the whole word reading strategy, FG exhibits poor irregular word processing in both reading and
spelling. Accordingly, poor irregular word performance has been
previously reported in children with a single VA span disorder
(Valdois et al., 2003, 2011) and VA span skills have been found to
specifically relate to irregular word reading in typically developing
children (Bosse & Valdois, 2009). Impaired VA span abilities are
further expected to affect pseudo-word reading because of hampering the parallel processing of graphemic units. The observation
of parsing errors in FG's pseudo-word reading suggests such a difficulty in this participant. However and still in accordance with FG
spelling pattern, a single VA span disorder is unlikely to affect
pseudo-word spelling which does not involve parallel visual processing but relies on phonological processing skills.
Overall, the present data thus suggest that FG exhibited a visual
parallel processing disorder but preserved phonological skills. In
contrast, LL was shown to exhibit poor phonological skills but preserved VA span abilities. Evidence for a dissociation regarding the
cognitive impairments of LL and FG led us to further investigate
whether we would be able to identify a similar distinct pattern
regarding the brain correlates of their respective phonological
and VA span disorders.

posterior and dorsal regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus,
including pars triangularis, play a key role in phonological processing (Booth et al., 2003; Heim, Opitz, Muller, & Friederici, 2003; Levy
et al., 2008; Pekkola, Laasonen, Ojanen, et al., 2006; Poldrack et al.,
1999). Assuming that the left inferior frontal cortex (BA 44/45) is
involved both in the processing of phonological information during
perception (Dufor, Serniclaes, Sprenger-Charolles, & Demonet,
2007; Heim et al., 2003; Zatorre, Evans, Meyer, & Gjedde, 1992; Zatorre, Meyer, Gjedde, & Evans, 1996) and in tasks tapping into phonological working memory (Davis et al., 2008; Nixon, Lazarova,
Hodinott-Hill, et al., 2004), under-activation of this region in LL
could well account for her poor performance in pseudo-word repetition and in the spoonerism task. It is moreover now well established that the motor-related part of Broca's area (BA 44) within
the left inferior frontal gyrus together with premotor neighbor
areas relate to phonological output processing (Binkofski & Buccino, 2004; Vigneau et al., 2006) and sub-vocal rehearsal (Paulesu,
Frith, & Frackowiak, 1993). Activation of this region in LL might
thus reflect a compensatory strategy for covert letter name rehearsal during the rhyming task. Similarly, stronger activation of two
parieto-temporal regions, i.e., the parieto-occipital junction (BA
19/39) and superior temporal gyrus (BA22) - typically involved
in the left perisylvian phonological network together with the
supramarginal gyrus and inferior frontal cortex - might reflect
some compensatory processing.
A new and surprising result with regard to the literature however needs to be highlighted here: FG showed normal activation
of all the brain regions that were implicated in the rhyming task
in skilled readers. The current findings thus suggest that brain activation patterns elicited during rhyme judgement differed between
the two dyslexic participants, illustrated by decreased activation of
the fronto-parietal network involved in phonological processing
for LL, but normal neural activity within these regions for FG.
5.4. Dissociated VA span neural underpinnings in FG and LL

5.3. Dissociated phonological neural underpinnings in LL and FG
The two dyslexic participants were then presented with a
rhyme judgement task under fMRI. In skilled readers, the rhyming
task implicated the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45), the left
supramarginal gyrus (BA 40) and occipito-parietal junction (BA
19/39), and the left fusiform gyrus (BA 37), thus the left cortical
network typically involved in phonological processing (Lurito
et al., 2000; Price, 2000; Price & Mechelli, 2005; Pugh, Shaywitz,
Shaywitz, et al., 1996; Rumsey et al., 1992). In contrast and in
accordance with previous reports of atypical activation of this fronto-parietal network in dyslexic individuals (Booth et al., 2003; Cao,
Bitan, & Booth, 2008; Demonet et al., 2004; Lurito et al., 2000;
Temple, 2002), the rhyming task only minimally activated the left
inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus in LL. In particular,
weak activation of pars triangularis (BA 45) within the inferior
frontal gyrus was highlighted in LL as compared to either the control group, or FG. However, LL showed higher activation of the left
superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) than FG and higher activation of
the left parieto-occipital junction (BA 19/39) and inferior temporal
gyrus (BA 37) than the skilled readers during the rhyming task.
Underactivation of a left fronto-parietal network consisting of the
left inferior frontal gyrus and the left supramarginal gyrus in LL appears critical as far as it is known that these two regions during
phonological processing and rhyming tasks are functionally connected (Cao et al., 2008; Catani, Jones, & Ffytche, 2005; Gough, Nobre, & Devlin, 2005; Lurito et al., 2000; Ruff, Cardebat, Marie, &
Demonet, 2002). Interestingly, a disconnection within this left
fronto-parietal network has been already proposed as a potential
cause for poor phonological skills in dyslexic individuals (Paulesu
et al., 1996). A large number of data further points out that the

Our two dyslexic participants were further presented with a
categorization task taxing visual attention. During the task, skilled
readers showed increased activation of a large parietal network
involving the left supramarginal gyrus (BA 40), the left angular/
middle occipital gyrus (BA 19/39) and the superior parietal lobule
bilaterally (BA 7). Interestingly, the present categorization task
thus recruited two brain regions, i.e., the left superior parietal lobule and left supramarginal gyrus, known to play a selective role in
the processing of orthographic units (Levy et al., 2008). The task
further recruited the left inferior temporal cortex in agreement
with previous findings showing that this brain area is involved in
letter-string processing (Cohen et al., 2000, 2002; Gaillard et al.,
2006; Pernet, Celsis, & Demonet, 2005; Tagamets, Novick, Chalmers, & Friedman, 2000).
Interestingly, FG's brain functioning during the task was characterized by lower activation than skilled readers both within the
superior parietal lobule (BA 7) bilaterally and within the left supramarginal gyrus. Furthermore, these two regions were significantly
less activated in FG than in LL who exhibited activation within the
two regions at the level of the controls. Activation of the parietal
network involved in orthographic processing has been obtained
in two experimental settings involving either visual categorization
processes (the current study) or and passive viewing (Levy et al.,
2008) which furthermore required parallel processing of letter sequences (i.e., presentation time short enough to prevent any eye
movement and/or analytic processing). A disruption of this neural
system in FG would thus prevent from a normal parallel processing
of orthographic units and letter-strings, well in line with his poor
VA span capacities. Similar findings have been recently reported
in a group of dyslexic children with a VA span disorder who

392

C. Peyrin et al. / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 381-394

showed decreased activity in both the left and right superior parietal lobules and the left supramarginal gyrus during the same visual categorization task (Peyrin et al., 2011).
Assuming that irregular word reading requires parallel processing of the word ``as a whole'', such a disorder is expected to primarily impact on irregular word encoding, thus resulting in poor
irregular word reading and spelling performance, as found in FG.
In contrast, LL who showed preserved performance in both the letter-report tasks and irregular word processing, recruited the parietal network subtending such orthographic processing at the
expected level during the visual categorization task.
6. Conclusions
The present study investigates two cases of young adults with
developmental dyslexia showing distinct and dissociated cognitive
profiles. The first participant, LL, showed a selective phonological
deficit but preserved VA span abilities. Conversely, the second participant, FG, exhibited poor VA span skills but preserved phonological abilities. Using fMRI, we showed that the two dyslexic
participants further demonstrated contrasting patterns of brain
activation. A disruption of the neural system in charge of phonological processing was found in LL despite normal activation of
the parietal network subtending parallel letter-string processing.
In contrast, in FG, fMRI analysis revealed a specific dysfunction of
the superior parietal lobules and left supramarginal gyrus during
visual multi-letter parallel processing but normal activation within
the frontal-parietal network involved in phonological processing.
The present results therefore suggest that distinct cognitive
impairments may relate to distinct brain dysfunctions in developmental dyslexia. Although further similar evidence in groups of
participants with developmental dyslexia is needed, the current
findings still are of theoretical relevance. They suggest that the heterogeneity of developmental dyslexia may echo the existence of
different dyslexic subtypes whose phenotypes dissociate in terms
of both cognitive and neurological features.
