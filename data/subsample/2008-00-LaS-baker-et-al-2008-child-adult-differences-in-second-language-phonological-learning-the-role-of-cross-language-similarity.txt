language (L2) than are adults (Birdsong & Molis, 2001; Flege, Yeni-Komshian, & Liu,
1999; Johnson & Newport, 1989; Stevens, 1999), especially in the realm of phonetics and
phonology (Flege, MacKay, & Meador, 1999; Guion, Flege, Lin, & Yeni-Komshian,
2000; Munro, Flege, & MacKay, 1996; Oyama, 1976). To date, most evidence for
child-adult differences in L2 phonological learning has come from studies examining
children's and adults' L2 perception and production after an extensive amount of L2
experience or exposure (e.g., Flege, MacKay et al., 1999). However, besides child-adult
differences per se, any evidence of child superiority observed in such cases might also
be attributed to differences in L2 input that children and adults receive throughout
L2 development (see, e.g., Flege, Yeni-Komshian et al., 1999; Jia & Aaronson, 2003).
The present study sidestepped this criticism in making child-adult comparisons by
testing children and adults at the onset of L2 phonological learning in a context where
the target language is spoken natively. The overall aim of the study was to provide
new insights into child-adult differences in L2 speech learning.
1.1
Child-adult differences in L2 learning

One common explanation for child-adult differences in L2 learning is the existence
of a critical period for the acquisition of an L2. The putative critical period is usually
associated with time-sensitive neurobiological maturation processes, resulting in a
decrease in the ability to fully acquire an L2 (e.g., Lenneberg, 1967). This approach
claims that, in order to reach native-speaker proficiency in an L2, learners need to
be exposed to the L2 within a narrow, neurologically-determined "window." Other
researchers argue for a sensitive rather than critical period, stating that early childhood represents an ideal, but not the only, time when a language can be acquired with
native-like accuracy (e.g., Abu-Rabia & Kehat, 2004; Hakuta, Bialystok, & Wiley,
2003). According to this view, early childhood represents a time where optimal input
and interaction with the L2 can take place (Mack, 2003; Pallier, Bosch, & SebastianGalles, 1997). (See Mack, 2003, for one conceptualization of the relationship between
critical and sensitive periods in L2 development.) Support for a critical or sensitive
period for L2 learning (e.g., Johnson & Newport, 1989; Newport, 1990) has parallels
in investigations of diverse aspects of sensory motor development in animals, for
example, in the ability of frogs to learn to swim (Moorman, Cordova, & Davies, 2002),
cats to see (Blausdel, Mitchell, Muir, & Pettigrew, 1977), birds to sing (Rozin, 1976),
or in the development of limb-eye coordination in rats (Fifkova, 1968).
While biologically-determined explanations for child-adult differences in L2
learning are appealing, testing the assumptions underlying the critical-sensitive period
hypothesis has proven quite difficult. In fact, adequately testing this hypothesis would
require attempting to ensure, for example, that children and adults receive the same
amount and type of L2 input and that they do not differ in their motivation to learn
an L2, in their extent of L2 use, nor in their degree of affiliation to an ethnic group
(Flege, Yeni-Komshian et al., 1999; Gatbonton & Trofimovich, 2008; Jia & Aaronson,
2003). After these conditions have been met, a valid test of this hypothesis would
also require direct measures of the neurobiological changes thought responsible for
changes in learning, with these changes measured throughout the learning process.
To our knowledge, none of these tests have ever been done.

At the same time, some researchers have called into question the very existence
of a critical or a sensitive period for L2 learning (e.g., Hakuta et al., 2003) due to
the abundance of conflicting evidence. For example, Abu-Rabia and Kehat (2004)
reported that older learners were more native-like in their L2 pronunciation than were
younger learners. Other studies have reported age-of-acquisition effects for learners
who were clearly beyond a critical or a sensitive period (e.g., Hirsh, Morrison, Gaset,
& Carnicer, 2003; Trofimovich & Baker, 2006). Such inconsistent findings suggest
that other explanations of age-of-acquisition effects are needed to account for the
results of those studies that do not support the critical-sensitive period hypothesis (e.g.,
Birdsong & Molis, 2001). In principle, such explanations can be compatible with the
critical-sensitive period hypothesis but they cannot draw solely on neuropsychological
evidence, at least until the current and future methodologies of neurophysiological
assessment can allow researchers to link language development to neurobiological
changes in the brain (see Pallier et al., 2003, for further discussion). Our goal here
was therefore to describe and test one such explanation of child-adult differences in
L2 phonological learning.
1.2
The interaction hypothesis

According to Flege's Speech Learning Model (Flege, 1995), one possible way in which
child-adult differences manifest themselves, at least in the realm of L2 phonological
learning, is through the interaction (bidirectional influence) of learners' native language
(L1) and their L2. More specifically, learners' L1 and L2 are believed to interact in a
different manner depending on the age at which the L2 is learned. This tenet of the
Speech Learning Model has been termed the "interaction hypothesis," or IH (Flege,
1992, 1999; Walley & Flege, 1999). It is likely that the L1 and L2 always influence each
other to some degree in all learners (Baker & Trofimovich, 2005; Mack, 1990). The IH
holds, however, that the nature of the L1-L2 interaction changes as a function of the
state of development of the L1 phonetic system at the time L2 learning begins.
As discussed below, there is evidence that the long-term memory representations
(categories) for vowels and consonants develop slowly through childhood and into
adolescence (Hazan & Barrett, 2000; Walley & Flege, 1999). As the L1 categories
develop, they are said to become stronger "attractors" for L2 sounds. Put another
way, L2 vowels and consonants become increasingly likely to be treated as variants of
an L1 category as the L1 phonetic system develops, even when L1-L2 differences can
be auditorily detected (see Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens, & Lindblom, 1992, for
a discussion of L1 categories as perceptual magnets, and Best, 1995, for a discussion
of perceptual assimilation).
Numerous studies to date have demonstrated that the L1 indeed exerts a powerful
influence on adults' ability to learn L2 sounds, and that adults' variation from native
L2 speaker perception and production is often traceable to their L1 (e.g., Flege, Bohn,
& Jang, 1997; see Best, 1995, and Flege, 1995, for reviews). By contrast, the influence of
the L1 on children's ability to learn L2 sounds is often less apparent. Children overall
appear more likely than adults to overcome L1 influences and to approximate native
L2 speaker perception and production more closely (Baker & Trofimovich, 2005; Flege,
MacKay et al., 1999; Flege, Yeni-Komshian et al., 1999). Thus, the IH proposes that
Language and Speech

Child-adult differences in L2 phonology

child-adult differences in L2 phonological learning depend on the degree to which
the L1 and L2 interact: the degree of interaction is weaker in younger learners and
is more pronounced in older ones. Conceptualized as the extent to which L1 and L2
phonetic systems interact in learners, child-adult differences in L2 phonological
learning can then be understood as a consequence of prior learning itself (Bever,
1981), a point we revisit below.
1.3
Tenets of the IH
1.3.1
L1 categories develop slowly

The IH hypothesis is founded on the observation that L1 categories develop slowly.
Previous research has shown that L1 phonological learning is gradual, characterized
by a slow attunement of L1 sound categories. Children learning their L1 display a
strong preference for the sounds of their L1 early in life, demonstrating a change from
language-general to language-specific processing of vowels at around six months
(Kuhl et al., 1992) and consonants at around 10 months of age (e.g., Werker & Tees,
1984). However, it appears that children's categories for specific L1 sounds and their
allophonic variants continue to become refined throughout childhood and perhaps
into adolescence (Hazan & Barrett, 2000; Walley & Flege, 1999; but see Sussman &
Carney, 1989). For example, native English children become increasingly more adept
between the ages of 6 and 12 years at discriminating English consonants, although
they do so less accurately than adults (Hazan & Barrett, 2000). When compared with
adults, children also have been shown to display less sensitivity in their discrimination
of L1 sounds (Flege & Eefting, 1986; Walley & Flege, 1999). Moreover, recent neurophysiological investigations exploring brainwave activity in response to speech stimuli
have demonstrated a progressive, developmental change in how speech is processed
across participants aged five years to adulthood (Cunningham, Nicol, Zecker, &
Kraus, 2000; Sharma, Kraus, McGee, & Nicol, 1997). When taken together, these
findings suggest that children's and even adolescents' L1 phonetic representations
are often not fully adult-like.
1.3.2
Mature L1 categories mask L1-L2 perceptual differences

As L1 categories develop, they become more robust, leading to more accurate performance in L1 speech processing tasks by older adolescents and adults. The structure of
the developing L1 sound categories, believed to be altered by the statistical distribution
of speech sounds in the L1 (Kuhl, 1998; Maye, Weiss, & Aslin, 2008; Maye, Werker, &
Gerken, 2002), have been shown to lead to changes in phonological encoding (Best,
1994), selective attention to speech (Pisoni, Lively, & Logan, 1994), and auditoryperceptual sensitivities within L1 sound categories (Kuhl, 1998; Kuhl et al., 1992;
Werker, 1994). One consequence of L1 category development, therefore, is that adults
possessing fully-developed L1 categories may be less likely to detect between-language
phonetic differences than children, and thus are more likely to perceive L2 sounds as
instances of L1 sound categories (Guion, Flege, Akahane-Yamada, & Pruitt, 2000;
Iverson et al., 2003). Moreover, a reason to suppose that children will be more likely
Language and Speech

W. Baker, P. Trofimovich, J. E. Flege, M. Mack, R. Halter

321

to detect between-language phonetic differences is that their L1 sound system is
still developing (Kuhl, 1991, 1998; Werker, 1994). Take, for example, the acquisition
of English // and /l/ by Japanese adults. Japanese has just one liquid //, whereas
English has two, // and /l/. Japanese adults tend to identify both English liquids as
instances of the one Japanese liquid, attending to acoustic properties that are useful
in distinguishing Japanese consonants but not English // and /l/ (Best, 1995; Guion
et al., 2000; Iverson et al., 2003). The perceived phonetic difference between Japanese
// and English // is somewhat greater than that between Japanese // and English
/l/, leading to somewhat better learning of English // (Guion et al., 2000). However,
the overall perceived similarity of // to // appears to block category formation in
most Japanese adults (Guion et al., 2000) but not children (Aoyama, Flege, Guion,
Akahane-Yamada, & Yamada, 2004).
1.3.3
Testing the IH

How might the IH be tested in an L2 study? According to the IH, children are less
likely than adults to perceive L2 sounds as instances of L1 sound categories and,
because of this, more likely to perceive and produce L2 sounds more accurately.
Trofimovich, Baker, and Mack (2001) showed that Korean adults typically identify
tokens of English // as instances of Korean /u/. If the IH is correct, then the Korean
children who have received a similar amount of L2 input as the Korean adults should
be less likely than the Korean adults to perceive English // as an instance of Korean
/u/. It should also hold true that these same Korean children should be more accurate
than the Korean adults in their perception and production of English //.
1.4
The present study

Although the IH is well motivated on theoretical grounds, its predictions have not been
extensively investigated. In fact, only a few known studies have demonstrated that
children are less likely than adults to treat L2 sounds as unambiguous instances of a
single L1 sound category. For example, Bond and Adamescu (1979; see also Butcher,
1976) showed that native English-speaking four-year-olds were more accurate than
adolescents (11-13 years old) and adults in perceiving a difference between English
plosive consonants and Hausa implosive consonants (unfamiliar to them). In particular,
the four-year-olds but not the adolescents or the adults distinguished the foreign
consonants from L1 consonants at significantly above-chance rates (72% accuracy).
Suggestive as these findings are, they do not clearly demonstrate that these same children are also more likely to perceive and produce non-native sounds more accurately
than adults, either initially or after several years of exposure to them. In other words,
it is still unknown whether children's ability to perceive L1-L2 differences confers
upon them an advantage over adults at perceiving and producing L2 sounds.
In the present study, our overall goal was, therefore, to link children's perception of the relationship between sounds in the L1 and L2 to the accuracy with which
they produce and perceive L2 sounds. In Experiment 1, we tested whether children
are indeed less likely than adults to perceive L2 sounds as instances of L1 sound
categories. Such a finding would indicate that children's L1 sound categories do not
Language and Speech

322

Child-adult differences in L2 phonology

interact with L2 sounds to the same degree as adults' L1 sound categories do. In
particular, we asked native Korean children and adults to identify English vowels in
terms of Korean vowel categories in a forced-choice identification task and to rate
the English vowels for "goodness of fit" to the same Korean vowel categories. In
Experiment 2, we examined how the interaction of children's and adults' L1 and L2
phonetic systems relate to their perception and production of English vowels. To this
end, we tested the same Korean adults and children in perception and production
tasks of the same English vowels.

2 Experiment 1

The purpose of Experiment 1 was to test the hypothesis that children are less likely
than adults to perceive L2 sounds as instances of L1 sound categories in the initial
stages of L2 learning. To this end, native Korean children and adults were asked
to classify English vowels in terms of Korean vowel categories in a cross-language
perceptual identification task. The stimuli were multiple natural tokens of English
vowels. Upon hearing each token, the participants were required to classify it as an
instance of one of the 10 vowels of standard Korean, and then to rate its goodness of
fit to the selected category. An English vowel was considered to have been an instance
of a Korean vowel category if most of its tokens were classified in terms of just one
Korean vowel category. The hypothesis tested here was that the Korean adults would
perceive the instances of each of the English vowels as members of a single Korean
vowel category to a greater extent than would the Korean children.
2.1
Method
2.1.1
Participants

The 32 participants in Experiment 1 were native speakers of Korean who resided in
Illinois (Urbana-Champaign or Chicago) at the time of the study. Half were children
and half were adults. The children (9 males, 7 females), who had arrived in the U.S.A.
at an average age of 10;0 (6;0-13;5) and had lived there for an average of 9 months
(5-13), had a mean age of 10;10 years (7;5-14;0). Two of these children (one 12- and
one 14-year-old) were slightly older than the rest. Although these two participants
might be considered adolescents, we grouped them with children for two reasons.
First, pre-adolescents and adolescents of this age, like younger children, process
speech differently than adults do (e.g., Cunningham et al., 2000; Hazan & Barrett,
2000). Second, these two participants' response patterns were similar to those shown
by the rest of the children. The adults (6 males, 10 females), who had arrived in the
U.S.A. at an average age of 25;1 years (19;8-31;0) and had lived there for an average
of 6 months (1-22), had an average age of 25;7 years (21;2-31;2).
The participants were selected on the basis of English-language experience and
language proficiency. The goal was to recruit children and adults having as similar and
as minimal an amount of exposure to English in the U.S.A. as possible. The participants,
whose length of U.S. residence ranged between 1 and 22 months, thus represented L2

learners with relatively minimal amount of exposure to the L2 in the target country (see
Tsukada et al., 2005, for a comparison of Korean children and adults with 3-5 years
of U.S. residence). Using a 10-point scale (1 = I don't speak any English, 10 = I am a
native speaker of English), the participants rated their ability to speak, read, write, and
comprehend English. (At least one of the children's parents was present to help verify
that the child's responses to the questions were accurate.) The obtained mean self-ratings
were 4.3 (2-7) for the adults and 4.5 (2-7) for the children. At least two children and one
adult rated themselves relatively high in English (i.e., a 7 on a 10-point scale). It is likely
that these participants overestimated their English ability. An informal pre-experiment
interview revealed that all participants were poor at listening and speaking. In fact, none
could easily carry on a simple conversation in English, suggesting that all participants
were beginning learners of English, at least with respect to their speaking and listening
ability. The participants also estimated their percent of daily Korean use. The obtained
mean ratings were 66% (30-80%) for the children and 61% (40-90%) for the adults. The
children and the adults did not differ significantly in terms of self-rated L2 proficiency
or use, p > .05.
Most of the adults were enrolled in a beginning ESL program at the University
of Illinois; most of the children were enrolled in ESL classes at their public school.
Prior to arriving in the U.S.A., the adults had studied English in Korea as part of
regular classroom instruction for an average of 9.2 years (9-13) and had been first
exposed to English at a mean age of 12;6 years (9;0-14;0). However, they had little
exposure to native speaker input before arriving in the U.S.A. and, despite several
years of language instruction, had little experience in listening or speaking English.
Because of the participants' low proficiency in English, all instructions were either
read by participants in Korean or given to them by a native Korean speaker.
2.1.2
Materials

This experiment focused on the contrast between English /i/-// (as in "beat" and "bit")
and /u/-// (as in "boot" and "book"). Both pairs of vowels tend to be confused, in
production and perception, by Korean learners of English (Flege et al., 1997). Three
native English speakers (see below) produced all four target vowels in three phonetic
contexts (b_t/k, n_t/k, h_d), yielding a series of monosyllabic English words (/i/: beat,
neat, he'd; //: bit, knit, hid; /u/: boot, nuke, who'd; //: book, nook, hood). It was hoped
that the multiple contexts would minimize the idiosyncratic effects of any single context
on the results obtained here (see Strange, Akahane-Yamada, Kubo, Trent, & Nishi,
2001). English words containing four additional English vowels (/ae/: bat, gnat, hat; //:
bet, net, head; //: bought, not, hot; //: but, nut, hut) were also recorded as distractors
in this and the following experiment. (For data pertaining to these vowels, see Baker,
Trofimovich, Mack, & Flege, 2002 and Trofimovich, Baker, & Mack, 2001.)
Given that children's and adults' familiarity with individual lexical items influences
measures of L2 perception and production (e.g., Walley & Flege, 1999), the participants
were asked to complete a vocabulary knowledge task after the test session. Following
Bradlow and Pisoni (1999), the participants rated their familiarity with each stimulus
word, presented in written form, using a 7-point scale (1 = I don't know the word, 7 = I
know the word and can use it in a sentence). The experimenter gave the participants an

example of how to rate the words, offering the Korean translation of the scale labels.
If reading seemed to be a problem (which rarely happened, but was more often true
for children than adults), the experimenter read the word aloud. As shown in Table 1,
some words (book, boot, beat) were more familiar than others (nook, nuke, knit) for both
groups. T-tests, however, revealed a significant child-adult difference in familiarity
ratings for just two words: bit, t(30) = 2.45, p = .02, and neat, t(30) = 3.04, p = .01.
The native English speakers who produced the stimulus words were all adult
males from the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S.A. (mean age: 24.2) who spoke
a variety of General American English. None were bilingual, and none had professional training in speech or linguistics. The test words were read three times each in
a carrier phrase (I say __ for you) at a self-selected normal speaking rate and were
recorded using a DAT recorder (Sony TCD-D8) and a Shure (SM10A) microphone.
The utterances were sampled at 22.05 kHz, and the test words edited out. The first
two authors selected what they judged to be the best two tokens of each test word
produced by each talker. They did so by examining each of the tokens both auditorilly and acoustically. The resulting 36 test words (12 words x 3 speakers) were later
normalized for peak intensity to reduce differences in perceived loudness.
2.1.3
Procedure

In this and the following experiment, participants were tested individually in a quiet
room, using a personal computer and speech presentation software (Smith, 1997).
The 144 stimulus words (36 test words x 2 repetitions, 36 distractors x 2 repetitions)
were randomly presented over stereo headphones (Sennheiser HD 535). As in previous
research, the participants provided two perceptual responses to each stimulus (Guion
et al., 2000; Strange et al., 2001). They first identified each stimulus in terms of one
of the 10 vowels of standard Korean (/i/, /o/, //, /y/, /oe/, //, /e/, //, /a/, /u/). The Korean

All participants were able to read Korean. Prior to the experiment, the participants
were asked to say the names of the characters to ensure their familiarity with the
characters and to minimize orthographic confusions among them. Although it might
be argued that listeners in such a task compare L2 tokens to abstract L1 phonological
representations or to specific exemplars of L1 sounds (see Pierrehumbert, 2003, for
discussion), in either case they are likely relying on their existing "knowledge" of the
L1 phonetic system (see Trofimovich et al., 2001).
The same stimulus was presented a second time 5 msec after the classification was
provided. The participants' task on the second presentation was to rate the similarity
of the token they had just heard in terms of its goodness of fit to the selected Korean
category. They used a 7-point scale (1 = sounded very dissimilar, 7 = sounded very
similar). Ratings of this kind are often obtained in conjunction with cross-language
identification responses (Guion et al., 2000). They provide a gradient of similarity (or
difference) for a perceptual match between an L2 sound token and the chosen L1 sound
category. Typically estimated on an ordinal scale, goodness-of-fit judgments may in fact
underlie cross-language identification responses, which suggests that listeners use the
same information in each token for both perceptual identification and goodness-of-fit
rating (Takagi, 1995). After the rating was given, the next stimulus was presented twice
(once for a similarity judgment and once for a goodness-of-fit rating), and so on.
Before testing, the participants were given a 10-item practice session to familiarize them with the procedure. They were able to ask the researcher questions as
they performed the practice. The researcher made sure that the participants clicked
the buttons labeled with Korean vowels after the first presentation of each word
and that they clicked the buttons labeled with goodness ratings (1 through 7) after
the second presentation of each word. Because the researcher was familiar with the
stimuli, the practice was guided at first. For example, the researcher would give the
following directions, especially to the children, during the first two or three practice
trials: "That word was bead. Which vowel in Korean does the vowel in bead sound
like?" The researcher could tell from the responses chosen whether or not the child
comprehended the purpose of the task.

Results

In the cross-language identification task, responses were scored by computing how
many times each participant identified all instances of a particular target vowel
category (English /i/, //, /u/, //) in terms of each of the 10 Korean vowels. For example,
the number of times each participant identified English /i/ as an instance of Korean
/i/ was tabulated, as well as the number of times each participant identified this same
English vowel with the nine other Korean vowels. Then the primary and most frequent
(modal) Korean vowel response alternative chosen in response to the nine tokens of
each English vowel (3 contexts x 3 speakers) was determined for each participant.
The dependent variable was the number of times (maximum = 9) with which this
modal Korean response category was chosen for the nine tokens of each of the four
English target vowels. The goodness-rating responses were scored by computing each
participant's goodness rating for the match between each token of an English vowel

and its Korean modal response alternative only. That is, goodness ratings were not
calculated for instances when the modal response was not chosen.
The two dependent variables just described (number of modal responses, mean
ratings) were examined in (2) Age x (4) Vowel analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Simple
effects and interactions were explored using Fischer's LSD tests using an alpha level of
.05. Effect sizes were estimated using partial eta squared, p2, calculated by dividing
the effect sum of squares by the effect sum of squares plus the error sum of squares.
For t-tests, effect sizes are reported as r.
Mean identification frequencies for each English vowel are presented in Table 2.
Both the Korean children and the adults selected a single Korean vowel as their primary
and most frequent (modal) response alternative a majority of the time in response to
all four English vowels (/i/, //, /u/, //). All participants without exception chose Korean
/i/ more frequently than any other Korean vowel when classifying both English /i/ and
English //. Similarly, all participants, both children and adults, used Korean /u/ more
frequently than any other Korean vowel to classify both English /u/ and English //.
The ANOVA examining how often (maximum) each participant chose the modal
Korean response alternative in response to each of the four English target vowels
yielded a significant main effect of age, F(1, 30) = 6.93, p = .013, p2 = .19, and vowel,
F(3, 90) = 31.21, p = .0001, p2 = .51, but not a significant two-way interaction, F(3, 90)
= .50, p > .50, p2 = .02. Tests of simple main effects revealed that the children differed
statistically significantly from the adults in the number of times they perceptually
identified three English vowels (//, /u/, //) with their modal Korean response alternatives (/i/, /u/, /u/, respectively). That is, the children mapped fewer tokens of each of
these three English vowels onto their respective modal Korean response alternatives
than the adults did, ts(30) > 2.05, ps < .05, rs > .35. However, the difference between
the children's and the adults' responses was non-significant for English /i/, t(30) =
1.71, p = .10, r = .30, although there was a numerical trend in the same direction as
for the other three English target vowels (see Table 2).

The average goodness ratings ranged from 4.1 to 5.5. The ANOVA examining
these ratings yielded a significant main effect of vowel, F(3, 90) = 7.86, p = .0001, p2
= .21. However, neither the main effect of age, F(1, 30) = 1.45, p < .20, p2 = .05, nor
the age x vowel interaction, F(3, 90) = 1.20, p > .25, p2 = .04, reached significance.
This suggested that the children, as a group, did not differ from the adults in their
goodness ratings when evaluating the perceptual match between English vowels and
their modal Korean response alternatives. However, a closer analysis of individual
response patterns revealed that the children tended to rate all English vowels as being
less similar to their modal Korean response alternatives than the adults did. For
example, the goodness ratings associated with the 90th percentile (the value below
which 90% of the ratings fall) were consistently lower for the children (/i/: 6.4; //: 6.0;
/u/: 5.9; //: 5.6) than for the adults (/i/: 7.0; //: 6.7; /u/: 6.7; //: 6.5).
2.3
Discussion

The results of this experiment suggested that the children appear to perceive fewer
tokens of English vowels as unique and unambiguous instances of a single Korean
vowel category. These child-adult differences reached statistical significance for three
of the four English vowels (//, /u/, //). The children also demonstrated a numerical
trend to identify English /i/ with Korean /i/ less often than did the adults. This difference did not reach statistical significance perhaps because English and Korean /i/
are perceptually highly similar, making it more likely for these two sounds to be
perceptually "confusable" (Trofimovich et al., 2001; Yang, 1996). However, this
finding only obtained in the analyses of cross-language identification. Although
there was a tendency for the children to give lower goodness ratings in response to
all four English vowels, at the group level the children did not differ from the adults
in how they rated the perceptual match between English and Korean vowels. One
explanation for this discrepancy may be that the procedure of cross-language goodness rating used here may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect differences
in the perception of the relationship between English and Korean vowels. A rating
scale that is more fine-grained than the one used in the present study could perhaps
make it possible in future research to detect potential differences between children's
and adults' perceptual goodness ratings (see Aoyama et al., 2004).
These findings would not provide support for the hypothesis that children are
less likely than adults to perceive L2 sounds as instances of L1 sound categories in the
initial stages of L2 learning if the obtained child-adult differences were developmental
in nature; that is, if the differences were due to the children's inability to perform the
experimental task as intended. To evaluate this possibility, three post-hoc analyses
were performed.
We first examined the Korean response alternatives chosen by the children
and the adults in response to each English vowel. If the children had been guessing
or had been off task, they could have chosen, at least to a certain extent, implausible or inconsistent Korean response alternatives in responding to English vowels.
Inconsistent or implausible response alternatives would include, for example, those
Korean vowels that are both perceptually similar and those that are dissimilar to the
English vowels. This analysis, however, revealed that both the children and the adults

selected acoustically and perceptually viable Korean vowel categories in response
to each English vowel. For example, in response to English /i/, both the children
and the adults chose the same three response alternatives: Korean /i/ (the modal
response alternative), Korean // (high unrounded central vowel), and Korean /y/
(high unrounded front vowel). Because these three Korean vowels are located in the
same region of the vowel space as English /i/ (Yang, 1996), they were considered viable
response alternatives (see Table 2).
To determine if the children were on task and performed the task as intended,
we next calculated the number of Korean vowel response alternatives (out of 10)
selected by each participant in response to each English vowel. If the children had
been merely guessing or had been off task, they would have chosen numerically
more types of vowel response alternatives than would the adults. For example, if a
participant selected Korean /i/, Korean //, and Korean /e/ in response to different
tokens of English /i/, this participant's type frequency count was 3 in this analysis.
A two-way ANOVA examining these values (see Table 3) yielded a significant main
effect of vowel, F(3, 90) = 12.57, p = .0001, p2 = .41, but neither the main effect of
age, F(1, 30) = 4.07, p = .06, p2 = .18, nor the two-way interaction, F(1, 30) = .59,
p > .25, p2 = .03, reached significance. This suggested that the children were not more
likely than the adults to choose quantitatively more Korean response alternatives in
response to any English vowel.
The final post-hoc analysis aimed to determine if response consistency was
comparable for the children and the adults. Response consistency, RC, was estimated
using the following formula: RC = 1- ((p log10 (1/p)) + (1-p) log10 (1/1-p)), where p is
the probability of response for a particular stimulus and the log base is the number of
response alternatives (Attneave, 1959). This measure, which has been used in previous
research examining children's speech processing (Hazan & Barrett, 2000; Ohde &
Sharf, 1988), estimates intra-subject response reliability. If children had been merely
guessing or had been off task, their responses would have been less consistent than
those of the adults. The ANOVA examining the RC values (see Table 3) yielded a
significant main effect of vowel, F(3, 90) = 30.87, p = .0001, p2 = .51, but not a significant main effect of age, F(1, 30) = 4.19, p = .06, p2 = .12, nor a two-way interaction,
F(3, 90) = .03, p > .50, p2 = .01. This suggested that the children and the adults
demonstrated a comparable degree of consistency in assigning tokens of English
vowels to Korean vowel categories.

Because the children were not more likely than the adults to choose inexplicable response alternatives, to select a different number of response alternatives,
or to respond inconsistently, the findings reported earlier can be taken as support
for the hypothesis that children are less likely than adults to perceive L2 sounds as
instances of a single L1 sound category. If children are indeed less likely than are
adults to perceive L2 sounds as instances of L1 sound categories, children might also
perceive and produce L2 sounds more accurately than adults. The next experiment
was conducted to test this possibility.

3 Experiment 2

The purpose of Experiment 2 was to determine whether children's and adults' judgments of cross-language similarity obtained in Experiment 1 for the four target English
vowels (/i/, //, /u/, //) might predict the accuracy with which the Korean children
and adults perceive and produce these same English vowels. Given that the children
appeared to perceive the English vowels as more dissimilar from L1 vowels than the
adults, it was hypothesized that children would also perceive and produce the English
vowels (/i/, //, /u/, //) more accurately than would the Korean adults.
3.1
Method
3.1.1
Participants

Half of the Korean participants took part in this experiment immediately before
Experiment 1, and the remaining half did so following Experiment 1. In addition, 16
adult (7 males, 9 females) and 16 child (9 males, 7 females) monolingual native speakers
of American English, all residents of Illinois, participated. The native English children
and adults had average ages of 10;8 years (8.0-13;10) and 24;0 years (20;0-32;0), respectively. The English children had not been exposed to any language other than English.
The English adults had not studied another language beyond minimal training in high
school or college language courses. Neither the Korean and English children, nor the
Korean and English adults, differed significantly in chronological age, p > .05.
3.2
Procedure
3.2.1
Vowel perception

The target vowels used in the vowel perception task were the same as in Experiment
1 (/i/, //, /u/, //). These vowels were produced in a CVC context, yielding the English
strings he'd, hid, who'd, and hood. The h_d phonetic context is frequently used in
speech perception research (e.g., Hillenbrand, Getty, Clark, & Wheeler, 1995) because
it tends to minimize contextual influences; namely, the fricative /h/ typically does not
influence the acoustic properties of neighboring vowels in English (Olive, Greenwood,
& Coleman, 1993). The three adult male monolingual native English speakers who
were selected to record the words had all been born and raised in Illinois (mean age:
Language and Speech

330

25;4 years), because the participants, both native and Korean, had been exposed to
the variety of English spoken in Illinois. In selecting the specific tokens to be used
as stimuli, we took care to identify tokens of the four vowel categories that did not
differ by more than 10 msec in duration. Although duration does indeed provide
a secondary perceptual cue for native English-speaking listeners to the contrasts
between English /i/-// and /u/-//, Flege et al. (1997) found that Korean adults tended
to focus exclusively on vowel duration, largely ignoring the primary cue to these vowel
distinctions, namely, spectral quality differences. Therefore, we chose vowel tokens
that were as similar in duration as possible.
The selected stimuli (1 token per speaker) were presented in pairs to test the
discrimination of /i/-// (he'd-hid), /u/-// (who'd-hood), and /i/-/u/ (he'd-who'd ). It
seemed likely that the Korean participants would have little difficulty discriminating
the vowels in he'd-who'd because these words contained English vowels, /i/ and /u/,
that were likely to be perceived as instances of two phonemically distinct Korean
vowels, /i/ and /u/, respectively (Trofimovich et al., 2001). Thus, performance on this
vowel contrast was intended to serve as a way to determine if the participants had
understood and were performing the task as intended.
In the categorial discrimination task used here (Flege, MacKay et al., 1999;
Gottfried, Jenkins, & Strange, 1985), the three stimuli presented in each triad were
always physically different tokens, each spoken by a different native English speaker. A
total of 24 triads were used to test each of the three vowel contrasts. Half of the trials
were "change" trials in which one token was drawn from a different vowel category
than the other two tokens. The remaining half of the trials were "no-change" trials
containing three physically different instances of the same vowel category. In response
to each, the participants were to click one of four buttons appearing on the computer
screen. The correct response for change trials was the serial position of the odd item
out (i.e., the button marked 1, 2, or 3). The correct response to no-change trials was the
fourth button, marked none (to indicate "no odd item out"). The inter-stimulus interval
between the three tokens in each trial was 800 msec. The next trial (triad) was presented
1 second after a response was received for the preceding trial. The participants were
permitted to replay the stimuli in a triad if they wanted, but could not change their
response once it had been given. To ensure that participants understood the task,
they performed a 10-item practice using non-test vowel tokens consisting of the same
vowels in the test condition before beginning the vowel discrimination test.
The dependent variable for each vowel contrast was A', a measure used to reduce
the effect of response bias. The A' scores were derived from the proportion of hits
(correctly choosing the "odd" item on change trials) and false alarms (incorrectly
choosing an "odd" item from among same items on catch trials) for each participant
and each vowel contrast (Snodgrass, Levy-Berger, & Haydon, 1985). An A' score of 1.0
indicates perfect discrimination while an A' score of .5 or lower indicates discrimination at or below chance.
3.2.2
Vowel production

The vowel production task focused on the same four target English vowels: /i/, //, /u/,
//. These vowels were produced in English CVC words (/i/: beat, bead, heat; //: bit, big, hid;
Language and Speech

W. Baker, P. Trofimovich, J. E. Flege, M. Mack, R. Halter

331

/u/: boot, booed, hoop; //: book, good, hood). These words were not identical to those
used in Experiment 1, with some words (e.g., who'd and neat) being replaced by more
picturable ones (e.g., hoop and bead, respectively) to facilitate elicitation in a picturenaming task. The stimulus words were recorded by a monolingual female native
English speaker from Illinois (age: 31;1 years), and were prepared as in Experiment 1.
As in Experiment 1, the Korean children and adults did not demonstrate systematic
differences in their familiarity with the words. An examination of familiarity ratings
(see Table 1) indicated that both the Korean children and adults were more familiar
with some words (e.g., book, big, good) than others (booed, bead, hoop), but the ratings
from the adults and children differed significantly for only one of the 12 words: heat,
rated as more familiar by adults than children, t(30) = 2.39, p = .025.
The participants were asked to name each word (and those of 12 additional
distractors) as simple line drawings of each were displayed. The 24 words were elicited
in a random order three times each. During the first elicitation, the participants
heard the name of the picture via a loudspeaker (Harman/Kardon) as the picture was
displayed. For the final two elicitations, the participants were asked to remember the
name of the picture and to say it upon seeing the picture. The participants were thus
not merely shadowing (imitating) the female speaker but were attempting to retrieve
their own phonological representation for each word. In the few (< 2%) instances in
which participants were unable to name the picture, the aural model was presented.
The participants' productions were recorded using high quality equipment (Shure
SM10A microphone, Sony TCD-D8 DAT recorder) for later analysis.
The last spontaneously produced token of each stimulus word was digitized.
The 768 stimulus words (12 words x 64 participants) were then normalized for peak
intensity, and presented to 10 adult listeners (aged 18-25 years) who were monolingual
native speakers of American English and had taken at least two courses in phonetics
in which they had received practice in transcribing English speech materials using IPA
symbols. The stimulus words were presented to the listeners in a randomized list one
at a time over stereo headphones (Sennheiser HD 535) with an inter-trial interval of
1 second. The listeners were instructed to listen to each stimulus word and to select
one of the 14 vowels of standard American English (/i/, //, /u/, //, /ae/, //, /e/, /o/, //, //,
//, /a/, /a/, //) that most closely corresponded to the vowel in the stimulus word.
The listeners were not told which vowel the participants had produced nor what
vowel was intended. The listeners were instructed to base their judgments upon the
vowels that were actually spoken, not the vowels that they thought were intended in
the stimulus words. The dependent variable was the number of listeners (maximum
= 10) who transcribed each vowel token as its intended target.

alarm rate: 1.3) and a low of .41 for the Korean children's discrimination of /u/-//
(mean hit rate: 1.6; mean false alarm rate: 3.5). A preliminary analysis indicated,
as expected, that the Korean adults and children did not differ significantly from
age-matched native English speakers for /i/-/u/, p > .10. Nor did either the Korean
or English children differ from either adult group, p > .10. This suggested that all
the participants, including the Korean children, understood task directions and
performed the task as intended.
The A' scores obtained for the remaining two contrasts were submitted to a
mixed-design (2) Age x (2) Language x (2) Vowel contrast ANOVA, with repeated
measures on the third factor. All three main effects reached significance: age F(1, 60)
= 8.33, p = .005, p2 = .12, language F(1, 60) = 90.29, p = .0001, p2 = .60, and contrast
F(1, 60) = 28.51, p = .0001, p2 = .32. The analysis also yielded significant contrast
x age, F(1, 60) = 5.13, p = .027, p2 = .08, and contrast x language, F(1, 60) = 4.17,
p = .046, p2 = .07, interactions.
The interactions obtained in the above analysis were explored by testing the
difference between the native English and Korean participants, and between the
children and the adults. Between-language comparisons revealed that the native
English speakers obtained significantly higher scores than did age-matched native
Korean participants for both /i/-//, t(30) > 4.46, p < .001, r > .63, and /u/-//, t(30)
> 4.15, p < .001, r > .60. Child-adult comparisons revealed higher scores for the native
English adults than children for /i/-//, t(30) = 4.33, p < .001, r = .62, and /u/-//, t(30)
= 2.87, p < .007, r = .46, but no significant differences between Korean children and
adults for either contrast, t(30) < 1.87, p > .07, r < .32.
3.3.2
Vowel production

Figure 2 shows the mean intelligibility scores obtained for /i/, //, /u/, // (i.e., the
percentage of times the vowels were heard as intended by the 10 native Englishspeaking listeners). These scores ranged between a high of 99% correct for the English
children's production of /i/ and a low of 37% correct for the Korean adults' production of //. When the listeners misidentified the intended vowel, they did so a great
majority of the time by selecting the other vowel in each vowel contrast (i.e., /i/ for
//, and vice versa, or /u/ for //, and vice versa). Other vowels chosen in place of the
intended targets accounted for less than 8% of the responses. The mixed-design (2)
Age x (2) Language x (4) Vowel ANOVA examining these scores yielded significant
main effects of age, F(1, 60) = 4.42, p = .04, p2 = .07, and language, F(1, 60) = 291.17,
p = .0001, p2 = .83, as well as significant vowel x language, F(3, 180) = 4.66, p = .004,
p2 = .07, and vowel x age x language, F(3, 180) = 3.16, p = .026, p2 = .05, interactions. The interactions appear to have been due to between-vowel differences as a
function of L1 background. Between-language comparisons revealed that all four
vowels produced by the English children and adults received higher scores than those
produced by the age-matched native Korean groups, t(30) > 2.66, p < .012, r > .44.
Child-adult comparisons revealed higher scores for the English adults than children

This final result was unlike the findings reported in the vowel discrimination task in
which the Korean children and adults did not differ in their perception accuracy.
3.4 Discussion

These results suggest that, following a relatively short (< 1 year) period of residence in
the U.S.A., the Korean children did not discriminate English vowels more accurately
than the Korean adults, but did produce two of the four English vowels examined
more accurately than the Korean adults. One might conclude from this that, contrary
to the claim of the Speech Learning Model (Flege, 1995), segmental production in
an L2 develops more rapidly than segmental perception. However, as discussed by
Tsukada et al. (2005, p. 286), there is reason for caution in reaching such a conclusion.
The perception task (categorial discrimination) may have been too difficult for the
children and the adults (e.g., Walley & Flege, 1999). To obtain a perfect score in this
task, it was necessary for participants to disregard irrelevant within-category variation (i.e., differences in speaker voices) while focusing on relevant between-category
variation (i.e., differences in vowel quality) across vowel tokens. The high scores (> .95,
maximum = 1.0) obtained by the native English adults suggested that listeners having
mature language-specific categories can do both. After only several months in contact
with English in the U.S.A., one would not expect either Korean adults or children to
have developed robust perceptuomotor categories for English vowels, and thus to have
obtained native-like discrimination scores for pairs of English vowels that do not readily
map onto vowels in the L1 vowel inventory. By contrast, vowel production, assessed
in an ostensibly easier picture description task, was more sensitive to detecting the
children's initial advantage at accurately producing at least some L2 vowels.
One interesting finding of this experiment, likely reflective of differences between
the two tasks, pertains to the relative difficulty of certain L2 contrasts for children
and adults. In the perception task (see Figure 1), the Korean adults attained higher
accuracy than the Korean children in their perception of the /u/-// contrast (although
this difference failed to reach statistical significance). However, these same adults did
not differ from the Korean children in their perception of the /i/-// contrast. (Note
a similar pattern in the English children's and adults' responses.) One factor likely
contributing to these differences between contrasts relates to the frequency with which
both contrasts occur in English. Indeed, English /i/ and // occur in more contrastive
environments than English /u/ and //, which may cause the /u/-// contrast to be more
difficult for children to learn (Edwards et al., 2004). For adults, who have learned to
distinguish these vowels through drills and other explicit methods of learning, such
a difference in lexical frequency between the two contrasts may be less apparent.
The main finding of this experiment was, however, that the Korean children
outperformed the Korean adults in production of two English vowels. This finding
is striking because children frequently perform more poorly than adults on a variety
of linguistic (both L1 and L2) and non-linguistic perceptuomotor tasks (Hazan &
Barrett, 2000; Snow & Hoefnagel-Hohle, 1978). In fact, the English children in this
experiment were less accurate than the English adults in their perception of two vowel
contrasts and in their production of one vowel. Flege et al. (2006), who compared
English sentences spoken by Korean adults and children to those spoken by native
Language and Speech

336

Child-adult differences in L2 phonology

English-speaking adults and children, also reported significantly lower ratings for
native English children than for adults (see also Johnson, 2000). By contrast, the
Korean children tested here did not differ from the Korean adults in their perception of
any vowel contrast examined and, in fact, outperformed the Korean adults in production of two English vowels (//, //), those that do not exist in the vowel inventory of
Korean. This finding may represent one of the very few demonstrations of children
outperforming adults on L2 speech tasks in relatively early stages of L2 phonological
learning, a finding that may not have been revealed by earlier studies (e.g., Snow &
Hoefnagel-Hohle, 1978) because these studies did not compare children's and adults'
L2 perception and production as a function of L1-L2 perceptual similarity.

4 Comparison of Experiments 1 and 2

The IH (Flege, 1992, 1999; Walley & Flege, 1999) offers at least one explanation for
the findings of this study. As discussed above, two predictions based on the IH were
evaluated here: (1) children are less likely than adults to perceptually associate L2
sounds with L1 sounds and, (2) because of this, children are more likely to perceive
and produce L2 sounds accurately. The experiments reported above yielded partial
support for both predictions. The children, compared with the adults, appeared to
perceive fewer tokens of three of the four English vowels examined in this study as
unique and unambiguous instances of a single L1 sound category. The children also
equaled the adults in perception of both vowel contrasts examined, and even surpassed
them in production of two of the four target vowels.
At least one way to interpret these findings would be to posit a relationship
between children's being less likely than adults to perceive L2 vowels as instances of a
single L1 vowel category and their ability to perceive and produce L2 vowels accurately
(Aoyama et al., 2004; Guion et al., 2000). This relationship was examined in a series
of Spearman rank-order correlation analyses. The correlations were computed (a)
between the Korean participants', n = 32, cross-language identification rates from
Experiment 1 and their production-accuracy scores for each of the four English
vowels from Experiment 2, and (b) between cross-language identification rates and
production-accuracy scores, on the one hand, and the participants' age of exposure
to English (AOE) and their length of residence (LOR) in the U.S.A., on the other. The
use of both AOE and LOR in these analyses was not arbitrary. AOE, as an index of
the participants' age at the time of exposure to English, was a variable of primary
interest here. In turn, LOR was an estimate of the participants' amount of exposure
to English. Because the Korean children had resided in the U.S.A. slightly longer than
the Korean adults (9 vs. 6 months, on average), it was possible that the findings of this
study might have been influenced, at least in part, by differences in the participants'
LOR. Cross-language similarity-rating scores and discrimination (perception) accuracy rates were not used in these analyses because the groups of Korean children and
adults did not differ on these variables for any of the examined vowels.
The correlation analyses yielded four findings. First, there appeared to be no
obvious relationship between the participants' cross-language identification judgments
and their production of English vowels. In fact, only one significant, albeit relatively
weak, correlation emerged in these analyses (for English /u/, r = .30, p < .05). Second,
Language and Speech

W. Baker, P. Trofimovich, J. E. Flege, M. Mack, R. Halter

337

there appeared to be a relationship between the participants' cross-language identification judgments and their AOE. This finding was based on weak-to-medium-strength
positive correlations between AOE and cross-language identification rates obtained
for all four English vowels, rs = .30 - .53, ps < .05, indicating that those participants
who were younger at the time of their exposure to English in the U.S.A. were also
those who were less likely to perceive English vowels as instances of a single Korean
vowel category. Third, AOE appeared to be related to the participants' production of
only two English vowels (//, //), that is, those vowels that are not part of the Korean
phonemic vowel inventory (although // is an allophone of /i/ in Korean). This finding
was based on medium-strength negative correlations between the participants' AOE
and their production of English // and //, rs = -.38 - -.46, ps < .05, suggesting that
those participants who were younger at the time of their exposure to English were also
those who were more accurate in their production of these vowels. Finally, there was
no significant association between the participants' LOR and their cross-language
identification judgments or their production of English vowels. This finding helped
rule out differences in participants' LOR as a factor explaining the obtained findings.
In sum, the correlation analyses indicated that the degree to which children and adults
perceive L2 vowels as instances of L1 vowel categories, as indexed by cross-language
identification rates, was not directly related to L2 production accuracy; however, both
these variables were related to AOE, at least for English // and //.
One way to conceptualize these findings is to suggest that age at the time of
exposure to the L2 (indexed here by AOE) serves as a variable mediating the relationship between the two abilities: being able to perceive L1-L2 phonetic differences and
being able to accurately produce L2 sounds. In other words, an individual's age at the
time of exposure to the L2 appears to determine the degree to which these abilities are
related. In younger learners, they are related more closely, allowing these learners to
perceive L1-L2 phonetic differences and to accurately produce L2 sounds, particularly
those that are not present in the L1 sound inventory (i.e., English //, //). In older
learners, producing L2 sounds and perceiving cross-language phonetic differences
represent abilities that are associated loosely (if at all). Whatever the exact relationship
between L2 production and perception of L1-L2 differences, a point which should be
investigated further, it appears that both abilities enable children to be more successful
than adults in L2 phonological learning.

5 General discussion

The purpose of the present study was to examine one explanation, based on the IH
of Flege's Speech Learning Model (although the Speech Learning Model was not
constructed to account for beginning learners such as those tested in this study), for
why children are often more successful than adults at L2 learning. The obtained results
in part provided evidence in support of the IH. In Experiment 1, the Korean children
were found to be less likely than the Korean adults to perceive English vowels as
instances of a single Korean vowel category. In Experiment 2, the same children were
more accurate than the adults in production of two of the four English vowels, notably,
those absent from the L1 vowel inventory, and equaled them in discrimination of both
examined English vowel contrasts. Both skills--being able to perceptually disassociate

338

Child-adult differences in L2 phonology

L2 sounds from L1 sound categories and being able to produce L2 sounds--appear to
be associated with the age at which the children and the adults were first exposed to the
L2, indicating that age may mediate the relationship between these two skills. Taken
together, these findings suggest that children, perhaps due to the developmental state
of their L1 at the time of their exposure to the L2, are able to perceptually distinguish
L2 sounds from similar L1 sounds and to produce and (perhaps) perceive such L2
sounds more accurately than adults (Aoyama et al., 2004; Flege, 1987, 1999, 2002,
2003; Guion et al., 2000).
This age-bound relationship between the ability to perceive L1-L2 differences
and L2 perception and production should be examined in future research in greater
detail, with a goal of identifying and describing cognitive and neurobiological factors
underlying this relationship. One such factor may pertain to neurobiologically based
age-related changes in the plasticity of brain structures underlying language learning
and use. That is, younger L2 learners, as compared to older L2 learners, may rely
on different language processing and learning mechanisms and/or may draw on
different brain structures in the course of language learning and use. For example, in
a functional magnetic resonance study, Kim et al. (1997) documented that the brain
areas involved in the processing of L1 and L2 overlapped in younger learners but did
not do so in older learners. In another study, Mechelli et al. (2004) demonstrated that
younger learners appeared to have a larger composition of grey matter in areas of the
brain devoted to language processing than did older learners.
Although revealing, the results of such studies are often difficult to interpret (see,
e.g., Perani et al., 1998) primarily because they do not indicate exactly how differences
in the scope and localization of brain activity in younger and older learners relate
to child-adult differences in the ability to perceive cross-language differences or to
perceive and produce L2 sounds. To begin investigating questions such as this, future
research should include both measures of children's and adults' ability to perceive
cross-language differences and neuropsychological measures of age-related changes
in children's and adults' L2 speech processing (see Cunningham et al., 2000).
In the meantime, before valid neuropsychological evidence is available to
document age-related changes in children's and adults' L2 speech processing, the
IH provides one possible account of child-adult differences in L2 learning. This
account is compatible with the "interference" explanations of adults' difficulties in
acquiring an L2 (Bever, 1981; Flege, 1992, 1999; Iverson et al., 2003; McCandliss, Fiez,
Protopapas, Conway, & McClelland, 2002; Pallier et al., 2003). Such explanations
posit that the act of prior learning itself, as opposed to age-bound neurobiological
limitations alone, imposes constraints on individuals' ability to learn new information.
Thus, for example, adults' difficulties in L2 learning may be traceable to age-based
developmental processes that render speech perception and production mechanisms
more specialized for the processing of L1 input and therefore functionally autonomous
(Bever, 1981). Likewise, adults' difficulties in L2 learning may be attributable to
perceptual distortions or to a loss of perceptual sensitivities due to adults' extensive
prior experience in processing L1 input (Iverson et al., 2003; McCandliss et al., 2002;
Pallier et al., 2003). Such perceptual interferences are believed to be "self-reinforcing"
(Iverson et al., 2003: B54), imposed on adults through their long-lasting exposure to
and experience with their L1.

Whether or not the results obtained in the present study represent such interference
explanations, the results reported here lend support to the claim that child-adult differences
in L2 phonological learning are at least in part the result of the still-developing phonetic
system of children's L1. Children thus appear to have an initial advantage over adults, an
advantage that may become even greater with time given subsequent differences in the
quality and quantity of input children and adults receive (Flege, Yeni-Komshian et al., 1999;
Jia & Aaronson, 2003). Whatever the ultimate cause of such child-adult differences, it is
hoped that this study invites further investigation into child and adult L2 speech learning
in particular, and into the processes underlying language learning in general.
