In one task-switching experiment, we compared bilinguals and monolinguals to explore the reliability of the bilingualism
effect on the n-2 repetition cost. In a second task-switching experiment, we tested another group of bilinguals and
monolinguals and measured both the n-1 shift cost and the n-2 repetition cost to test the hypothesis that bilingualism should
confer a general greater efficiency of the executive control functioning. According to this hypothesis, we expected a reduced
n-1 shift cost and an enhanced n-2 repetition cost for bilinguals compared to monolinguals. However, we did not observe
such results. Our findings suggest that previous results cannot be replicated and that the n-2 repetition cost is another index
that shows no reliable bilingualism effect. Finally, we observed a negative correlation between the two switch costs among
bilinguals only. This finding may suggest that the two groups employ different strategies to cope with interference in
task-switching paradigms.

The issue of whether bilingualism affects an individual's
executive control (EC) functioning has recently been
the subject of debate. Despite some studies showing
bilingualism's impact on the EC system (e.g., Costa,
Hernandez & Sebastian-Galles, 2008; Bialystok, Craik,
Green & Gollan, 2009; Costa, Hernandez, Costa-Faidella
& Sebastian-Galles, 2009; Abutalebi, Della Rosa, Green,

& Bak, 2015; Verreyt, Woumans, Vandelanotte, Szmalec
& Duyck, 2016; Wiseheart, Viswanathan & Bialystok,

and questions have been raised about the robustness
and reliability of the bilingualism effect on EC (e.g.,
Kousaie & Phillips, 2012a, 2012b; Paap & Greenberg,
2013; Prior & Gollan, 2013; Dunabeitia, Hernandez,
Anton, Macizo, Estevez, Fuentes & Carreiras, 2014;
Kousaie, Sheppard, Lemieux, Monetta & Taler, 2014;
Mor, Yitzhaki-Amsalem & Prior, 2015; Paap, Johnson
& Sawi, 2014; Paap & Sawi, 2014; de Bruin, Bak &
Della Sala, 2015; von Bastian, Souza & Gade, 2016).
Indeed, failures to replicate seminal results have divided
the researchers in the field; while some have attributed
these inconsistencies to methodological factors (see Bak,
2015; Valian, 2015; Yang, Hartanto & Yang, 2016), others
have even discredited the existence of the phenomenon per
se (e.g., Paap, Johnson & Sawi, 2015).
In an attempt to deal with more sceptical views,
recent research efforts have been dedicated to specifying
the cognitive processes affected by bilingualism by
testing large samples of participants on different EC
tasks measuring various cognitive processes. In doing
so, many recent studies have provided direct and
conceptual replications1 of previous experiments in which
bilingualism effects were observed. In this context, it has
become increasingly evident that many cognitive indexes
(e.g., conflict effect, n-1 shift cost, etc.) that are generally
used to measure EC among bilinguals and monolinguals
do not reliably show bilingualism effects. Although
a possible reason is that the phenomenon itself (i.e.,
bilingualism effect on EC) does not exist (e.g., Paap et al.,
2015), some cognitive indexes still need to be explored
for reliability before reaching a definitive conclusion.
One of the goals of the present study is to focus on
one index of EC functioning that should be explored
better with respect to bilingualism, such as the n-2
repetition cost in task switching (Mayr & Keele, 2000;
Prior, 2012). This cost refers to the observation that when
switching among three tasks, switching back to a recently
performed task (ABA) is harder than switching to a
new task (CBA), as indicated by longer response times
(RTs) and the increased number of errors. This effect is
often interpreted as reflecting residual inhibition, which
needs to be overcome and hampers the reactivation of the
currently relevant task (e.g., Mayr & Keele, 2000).
Recent evidence suggests that inhibition that is measured through the n-2 repetition cost cannot be generalised

from bilingual language control to domain-general EC
(Babcock & Vallesi, 2015; Branzi, Calabria, Boscarino
& Costa, 2016). Given these results, researchers should
not expect any effect of bilingualism on this index of
inhibitory control. In other words, researchers should
predict that they will likely observe similar n-2 repetition
costs when comparing bilinguals and monolinguals.
However, the issue is quite controversial. In a previous
study, Prior (2012) found bilinguals showing larger n-2
repetition costs than monolinguals. To explain this result,
the author argued that life-long language control experience with inhibitory control made bilingual speakers
more efficient in applying inhibitory control processes
than monolinguals and, consequently, more prone to show
larger costs related to inhibition2 (i.e., n-2 repetition
costs). This finding is especially interesting because it
shows that under proper experimental conditions, more
efficient EC functioning may lead to poorer performance
(see also Hernandez, Costa & Humphreys, 2012 for a
similar argument). Since this result has not yet been
replicated and, to some extent, it contrasts with recent
findings (e.g., Babcock & Vallesi, 2015; Branzi et al.,
2016), the present study aims to assess its reliability.
Another interesting issue explored in the taskswitching literature is how the finding about larger n-2
repetition costs for bilinguals (Prior, 2012) is reconcilable
with the result about reduced n-1 shift costs for bilinguals
(Prior & MacWhinney, 2010).
According to Prior (2012), the bilingual advantage in
n-1 shift costs (e.g., Prior & MacWhinney, 2010) and
the bilingual `disadvantage' in n-2 repetition costs may
arise because bilinguals are more efficient in applying
the dominant strategy as determined by experimental
conditions3 , might this be the reliance on task activation
(e.g., when repetition trials are present in the task) or
on task inhibition (e.g., when only switch trials are
present) or on both processes. However, an alternative
hypothesis explains the same pattern of switch costs
among bilinguals, which refers to their enhanced abilities
of inhibitory control. In fact, if bilinguals are better
inhibitors than monolinguals, they may apply a stronger
inhibition of the just executed task. This would result in
a bilingual advantage in n-1 shift costs and, at the same
time, in a disadvantage in n-2 repetition costs.

It is important to distinguish between direct (or exact) and conceptual
replications in experimental science (see Schmidt, 2009). In direct
replication, the same task, type of participants, method, procedures
and analysis are used to establish if seminal findings can be
replicated. Conceptual replication refers to the use of a conceptually
similar experimental setting (not exactly the same) to measure the
same theoretical variables. Conceptual replications are crucial in
experimental science since they allow investigating the extent to
which research findings can be generalised beyond the experiment
itself (Stroebe & Strack, 2014).

3

Note that task inhibition (measured through the n-2 repetition cost) is
a rather fundamental mechanism in the sense that it is also observable
in preplanned sequences (Mayr & Keele, 2000). In other words,
even if participants know that they must switch back to a previously
performed task, they experience the n-2 repetition cost. Hence, the
higher n-2 repetition cost for bilinguals vs. monolinguals (Prior, 2012)
could reflect a negative effect of bilingual language control on a very
automatic EC process.
Kroll and Bialystok (2013) proposed a similar hypothesis -
bilingualism would confer a general greater efficiency of EC
functioning.

On the bilingualism effect
Although the reported switch costs patterns may
originate from either a bilingualism effect on inhibition or
a generalised cognitive advantage, both these hypotheses
predict a striking pattern of results. First, they predict an
interaction between the language status and the magnitude
of the different switch costs. In other words, in the same
experiment, one should expect to observe larger n-1 shift
costs for monolinguals and larger n-2 repetition costs
for bilinguals. Second, if both n-1 shift costs and n2 repetition costs originate from the same mechanism
(e.g., inhibition), one should expect to find a negative
correlation between the magnitude of n-1 shift costs and
that of n-2 repetition costs, likely irrespective of the
participants' language status. In other words, based on
the assumption that inhibition (measured as n-2 repetition
costs) contributes to n-1 shift costs (Mayr & Keele, 2000),
the better an individual's inhibitory functioning is, the
smaller the n-1 shift cost and the larger the n-2 repetition
cost should be. This assumption was recently tested in
one study in our laboratory (Branzi et al., 2016). Actually,
we revealed a negative significant correlation between the
two costs in a group of bilinguals. However, it remains
an empirical question whether the same results would be
observed among monolinguals.
The present study aims at filling this gap by testing
these two predictions. Furthermore, considering our
assessment of n-2 repetition costs and n-1 shift costs
within the same experimental design, we can draw a
direct link between the differences for monolinguals and
bilinguals that have been observed to date.
1.1. The present study
To summarise, we conducted two task-switching
experiments. In Experiment 1, we aimed at providing the
first conceptual replication of a cognitive index in task
switching related to bilingualism, that is, the n-2 repetition
cost. Hence, we performed an experiment similar to that of
Prior (2012) in which we tested a group of 90 participants
(40 Catalan-Spanish highly proficient bilinguals and 50
Spanish monolinguals) in a task-switching paradigm,
where they had to sort a given target according to three
possible perceptual tasks indicated by valid cues (i.e.,
symbols surrounding a frame containing the stimulus).
The trials' sequence was set to make it possible to assess
the n-2 repetition cost (ABA vs. CBA task sequences). We
hypothesised that if the n-2 repetition cost would be a reliable index that could be used to argue about the differences
in EC functioning between bilinguals and monolinguals,
we should find the same results as those of Prior (2012).
In Experiment 2, we introduced task repetitions to measure both the n-2 repetition costs and the n-1 shift costs. In
this way, we were able to assess whether bilinguals would
show larger n-2 repetition costs and smaller n-1 shift costs
than monolinguals in the same task-switching experiment.

197

We conducted a second experiment with 205 participants
(100 Catalan-Spanish highly proficient bilinguals and 105
Spanish monolinguals), in which both the n-1 shift costs
and the n-2 repetition costs were assessed at the same
time. The participants were asked to perform the same
experiment as Experiment 1, except that repetition trials
were included in the task. Hence, the trials' sequence was
set in such a way that we could assess both the n-1 shift
costs (CBA vs. CAA task sequences) and the n-2 repetition
costs (ABA vs. CBA task sequences). Importantly, to
explore the relationship between the n-1 shift costs and
the n-2 repetition costs, we carried out a correlation
analysis between them for all the participants, as well
as for bilinguals and monolinguals separately.
2. Experiment 1: task switching without repetitions
2.1. Materials and methods
Participants
Ninety participants (40 Catalan-Spanish highly proficient
bilinguals and 50 Spanish monolinguals) were tested
in Experiment 1. Five bilingual and nine monolingual
participants were eliminated from the individual dataset
for the following reasons: 1) age over the established
range (i.e., participants older than 30), 2) number of
errors that were three standard deviations (SDs) above
the group mean and 3) inappropriate language status
(e.g., some participants in the monolingual group were
bilinguals). Therefore, the analyses reported below refer
to 35 bilinguals (21 females; mean age = 22 years,
SD = 2) and 41 monolinguals (34 females; mean
age = 22 years, SD = 4). All the participants were righthanded university students and had normal or correctedto-normal vision.4 Information about the languages
and the self-assessed proficiency of the bilinguals and
the monolinguals are reported in Table 1. Furthermore,
Table 5 presents the scores relative to the frequency of
language switching by bilinguals, which were assessed
by administering the bilingual switching questionnaire
(BSWQ) (Rodriguez-Fornells, Kramer, Lorenzo-Seva,
Festman & Munte, 2012). Finally, a detailed description
of the bilingual and the monolingual samples is reported
in Appendix.

In some studies, bilingual and monolingual participants were matched
according to their basic perceptual-motor skills (e.g., Paap et al.,
2013) and video-game experience (e.g., Costa et al., 2009) to avoid
confounding. In the present study, such information could not be
provided. Although this missing data represented a shortcoming, at
least, the compared groups were homogeneous regarding variables
(age and health conditions) that have been known to affect basic
perceptual-motor skills (see Durkin, Prescott, Furchtgott, Cantor &
Powell, 1995; Rodrigue, Kennedy & Raz, 2005; Gobel, Blomeke,
Zadikoff, Simuni, Weintraub & Reber, 2013).

Language proficiency scores were measured on a 7-point scale, where 7 = a very high level and
1 = a very low level of proficiency. The self-assessed index is the average (mean) of
participants' responses relative to each domain (reading, writing, speaking and comprehension).
The SDs are enclosed in parentheses.

Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and scores
relative to socio-economic status (SES)
The bilinguals and the monolinguals completed Superior
Scale I of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices
(Raven, Raven & Court, 1998) that measures non-verbal
intelligence. The test consists of 12 puzzles with a missing
piece. The participants were asked to select one piece
among eight possibilities to complete the puzzle. The
test lasted approximately 10 minutes. Both groups had
comparable scores [t (74) = 1.063, p = 0.291].
We also calculated SES scores based on parental
education (years) and total monthly family income (the
scores ranged from 1 to 5, depending on the family's
total income, e.g., <800 = 1, 800-1200 = 2, 1201-
1800 = 3, etc.). Regarding parental education, bilinguals
(mean years = 12.88, SD = 2.4) and monolinguals
(mean years = 13.31, SD = 2.1) were comparable
[t (74) = 0.825, p = 0.412]. In terms of total family
income, bilinguals (mean score = 3.6, SD = 1.3) and
monolinguals (mean score = 3.3, SD = 1.4) were
comparable [t (74) = -0.961, p = 0.34].
Materials
The participants were presented with three-dimensional
stimuli and were required to switch among three
perceptual classification tasks. Similar to previous studies
(Philipp & Koch, 2006; Branzi et al., 2016), the tasks

required sorting stimuli by "type" (A vs. 4), "size" (big
vs. small) and "colour" (red vs. blue). The stimuli were
presented one at a time on a white background at the
centre of the screen. Each task was indicated by four cue
signs surrounding the stimulus. The cues were paragraph
symbols for the type task, small yellow squares for the
colour task, and up-down pointing arrows for the size
task. The responses were given manually on an external
keyboard with three response keys for each hand. Similar
to our previous study (Branzi et al., 2016), we adopted this
setting to avoid response overlapping across tasks. Hence,
three keys were used to respond to "A", "big" and "red"
and three other keys were used to respond to "4", "small"
and "blue".

Procedure
In the beginning, the participants received written and
oral instructions for the experiment. Next, they took part
in the experiment in a single session of approximately
45 minutes. The instructions emphasised speed and
accuracy. We informed the participants about the tasks
and the response keys (the response keys on the keyboard
were labelled) but did not mention the presence or absence
of repetitions. Before being tested in the experiment,
all the participants were trained in a practice session to
familiarise themselves with the task and to learn stimulusresponse (S-R) mappings appropriately.

On the bilingualism effect
The experiment consisted of six blocks, each with
108 trials. The response-stimulus interval (RSI) was
maintained constant (1100 ms), as well as the cue-stimulus
interval (CSI) (100 ms).
In this experiment, the ABA (or n-2 repetition) and
the CBA (or n-2 switch) task sequences occurred with a
probability of 50% each. We refer to A, B and C to indicate
each task (i.e., type, size and colour), which occurred in
the experiment with an equal probability. A trial started
with a blank screen, followed by the cue (i.e., a blank frame
surrounded by four cue signs), and after 100 ms (CSI), the
stimulus was presented in the middle of the blank frame,
simultaneously with an acoustic tone. The stimulus and
the cue remained on the screen until the response was
given (or with a maximum delay of 7000 ms). The next
cue followed after 1000 ms, leading to an RSI of 1100 ms.
At the end of each block, the participants were allowed
to take a break and received a feedback relative to their
performance, given as the percentage of correct responses.
Data analysis and results
Each trial was assigned to one of the two conditions (i.e.,
CBA or n-2 switch, ABA or n-2 repetition), depending
on the nature of the two preceding trials (the n-1 and the
n-2 trials). For example, considering the sequence CBA,
where A is trial n, A is preceded by n-1 trial B and n-2 trial
C. In this case, trial A (n) is assigned to the condition CBA
or n-2 switch, given that trial n-1 and trial n-2 are both
different from A. On the other hand, in the ABA sequence,
n trial A is preceded by n-1 trial B and n-2 trial A. In this
case, n trial A is assigned to the condition n-2 repetition,
given that the n-2 trial and the n trial require to performing the same task (i.e., A). The first two trials of each
block were excluded from the analysis because they could
not be classified as either `n-2 switch' or `n-2 repetition'.
The RTs exceeding three SDs above or below a
participant's mean were excluded from the analyses. Then,
every error and the two trials following an error were also
discarded, leading to a data loss of 10% (SD = 6) for
bilinguals and 9% (SD = 5) for monolinguals.
First, we analysed RTs and error rates for the two types
of sequences, that is, ABA (or n-2 repetition) and CBA (or
n-2 switch), to explore potential differences in the overall
speed and accuracy between bilinguals and monolinguals.
Hence, we ran two repeated-measures ANOVAs (one for
RTs and the other for error rates) with types of sequence
(ABA or n-2 repetition and CBA or n-2 switch) as a withinsubject factor and group (bilinguals and monolinguals) as
a between-subject factor.
Furthermore, when the interaction between types of sequence and group was significant, in a successive analysis,
we also compared the magnitude of the n-2 repetition cost
between bilinguals and monolinguals. The n-2 repetition
cost was calculated by subtracting the RTs of the CBA
task sequences from those of the ABA task sequences.

Mean RTs, error rates and magnitude of the n-2

RTs and error rates
For RTs, ANOVA results revealed a significant main effect
of types of sequence [F (1, 74) = 126.458, p < 0.001,
p2 = 0.631], indicating that the ABA conditions
(1167 ms) were significantly slower than the CBA conditions (1112 ms). The main effect of group was significant
[F (1, 74) = 6.782, p = 0.011, p2 = 0.084], suggesting
that bilinguals were overall faster than monolinguals
(bilinguals = 1062 ms; monolinguals = 1217 ms). Finally,
the types of sequence X group interaction was not
significant [F (1, 74) = 1.337, p = 0.251, p2 = 0.018].
This result showed that the magnitude of the n-2 repetition
cost was not different between the groups (bilinguals = 50
ms; monolinguals = 62 ms).
For error rates, the main effect of types of sequence was
not significant [F (1, 74) = 1.060, p = 0.306, p2 = 0.014],
indicating that the ABA conditions (3.3%) and the
CBA conditions (3.1%) elicited the same amount of
errors. No significant difference in error rates between
monolinguals (3%) and bilinguals (3.4%) was found
[group: F (1, 74) = 0.435, p = 0.512, p2 = 0.006]. The
interaction between types of sequence and group showed
a trend towards significance [F (1, 74) = 3.221, p = 0.077,
p2 = 0.042]. A closer look at the data revealed that this
interaction was due to the bilinguals' similar error rates
in the CBA (3.4%) and the ABA conditions (3.3%). In
contrast, monolinguals made more errors in the ABA
conditions (3.3%) than in the CBA conditions (2.8%) (see
Table 2).
The results presented above suggest that the magnitude
of the n-2 repetition cost in RTs is not modulated by
bilingualism. However, bilinguals appear to be faster

Language proficiency scores were measured on a 7-point scale, where 7 = a very high level and 1 = a very low
level of proficiency. The self-assessed index is the average of participants' responses relative to each domain
(reading, writing, speaking and comprehension). The SDs are enclosed in parentheses.

than monolinguals across all conditions (see Costa et al.,
2008).
To test the bilingualism effect on both the n-2 repetition
costs and the n-1 shift costs in the same task switching,
we ran a second experiment, in which we tested bilingual
and monolingual participants.
3. Experiment 2: task switching with repetitions
3.1. Materials and methods
Participants
One hundred highly proficient Catalan-Spanish bilinguals
and 105 Spanish monolinguals took part in Experiment
2 with task repetitions. Nine bilinguals and four
monolinguals were eliminated from the individual dataset
due to the same issues reported in Experiment 1.
Therefore, the analyses reported below refer to 91
bilinguals (62 females; mean age = 22 years, SD = 2)
and 101 monolinguals (90 females; mean age =
21 years, SD = 3). All the participants were righthanded university students and had normal or correctedto-normal vision.5 Information about the languages

Similar to Experiment 1, in this experiment, bilinguals and
monolinguals were also not matched based on their basic perceptualmotor skills and video-game experience.

monolinguals are reported in Table 3. Furthermore,
Table 5 presents the scores relative to the frequency of
language switching by bilinguals, which were assessed
by administering the BSWQ (Rodriguez-Fornells et al.,
2012). Finally, a detailed description of the bilingual and
the monolingual samples is reported in Appendix.

Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and scores
relative to SES
The bilinguals and the monolinguals completed Superior
Scale I of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (Raven
et al., 1998). Both groups obtained comparable scores [t
(190) = -0.719, p = 0.473].
We calculated the SES scores based on parental
education (years) and total family monthly income,
similar to Experiment 1. With respect to parental
education, bilinguals (mean years = 13, SD = 2.5) and
monolinguals (mean years = 12.6, SD = 3.1) were comparable [t (190) = -1.181, p = 0.239]. Regarding total
family income, bilinguals (mean score = 3.4, SD = 1.4)
and monolinguals (mean score = 3.1, SD = 1.3) were
comparable [t (190) = -1.355, p = 0.177].

Materials
The materials used in Experiment 1 were also used in
Experiment 2.

On the bilingualism effect
Procedure
Experiment 2 adopted the same procedure as that of
Experiment 1, except that repetition trials (i.e., CAA)
were present. We opted for the following frequencies of
task triplets as explained below. Both the ABA (or n-2
repetition) and the CBA (or n-2 switch) task sequences
occurred with a 39% probability, and the CAA (or
n-1 repetition) task sequences occurred with an 11%
probability (note that the sum of probabilities was lower
than 100% because all trials following repetitions were
not analysed).
Some studies have suggested that the magnitude of the
n-2 repetition cost may be hindered by the presence of task
repetitions (e.g., Philipp & Koch, 2006). This appears to
be true when repetition trials (i.e., CAA) are as frequent
as the n-2 switch (i.e., CBA) and the n-2 repetition (i.e.,
ABA) trials (see Experiment 1 in Philipp & Koch, 2006).
However, when the occurrence of repetitions is notably
reduced6 compared to that of the other two conditions, the
size of the n-2 repetition cost is not dramatically affected
(see Experiment 2 in Philipp & Koch, 2006). Hence,
given that we aimed to assess the two costs in the same
experiment, we decided to introduce fewer repetitions
(e.g., CAA) compared to the other two conditions.
Data analysis and results
Each trial was assigned to one of the three conditions
(CBA or n-2 switch, ABA or n-2 repetition and CAA
or n-1 repetition), depending on the nature of the two
preceding trials (n-1 and n-2 trials). The first two trials of
each block were excluded from the analysis, as well as the
trials after repetitions (i.e., CCA).
The RTs exceeding three SDs above or below a
participant's mean were excluded from the analyses. Every
error and the two trials following an error were also
discarded, leading to a data loss of 9% (SD = 6) for
bilinguals and 10% (SD = 6) for monolinguals.
First, we analysed RTs and error rates for the three types
of sequences - ABA (n-2 repetition), CBA (n-2 switch)
and CAA (n-1 repetition) - to reveal potential differences
in the overall speed and error rates between the two groups.
To do so, we performed two repeated-measures ANOVAs
(one for RTs and the other for error rates), with types
of sequence (ABA or n-2 repetition, CBA or n-2 switch
and CAA or n-1 repetition) as a within-subject factor and
group (bilinguals and monolinguals) as a between-subject
factor.
Furthermore, when the interaction between types of
sequence and group was significant, we compared the
magnitude of the n-2 repetition cost and the n-1 shift
6

Note that the "reduction" in the number of repetitions in the task refers
to the overall number of repetition trials (i.e., CAA trials) presented
in the task compared to the other types of trials (i.e., CBA and ABA
trials).

cost between bilinguals and monolinguals in a successive
analysis. Hence, we performed an ANOVA by considering
types of cost (n-1 shift cost and n-2 repetition cost)
as a within-subject factor and group (bilinguals and
monolinguals) as a between-subject factor. Similar to
Experiment 1, the n-2 repetition cost was calculated by
subtracting the RTs of the CBA task sequences from
those of the ABA task sequences. The n-1 shift cost
was calculated by subtracting the RTs of the CAA task
sequences from those of the CBA task sequences.
Importantly, we were interested in exploring the
relationship between the n-1 shift costs and the n-2
repetition costs. Therefore, we performed a correlation
analysis between the magnitudes of these two costs across
all participants, as well as separately for the two groups
of participants.
Mean RTs, error rates and magnitudes of the switch
costs are reported in Table 4. The correlation analyses
relative to the n-1 shift and the n-2 repetition costs are
illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3.
RTs and error rates
For RTs, the ANOVA results revealed a significant
main effect of types of sequence [F (2, 380) = 132.123,
p < 0.001, p2 = 0.410]. Post-hoc tests showed that
each task sequence was different from one another
(all ps < 0.001), that is, the CAA conditions were
the fastest (1005 ms), and the ABA conditions were
the slowest (1101 ms), with the CBA conditions
in the middle (1052 ms). The main effect of group
was not significant [F (1, 190) = 1.704, p = 0.193,

p2 = 0.009], suggesting similar overall RTs in the two
groups (bilinguals = 1035 ms; monolinguals = 1070 ms).
Moreover, the types of sequence X group interaction
was also not significant [F (2, 380) = 0.611, p = 0.543,
p2 = 0.003], suggesting that the magnitudes of the
costs were the same in both groups (n-1 shift cost:
bilinguals = 50 ms; monolinguals = 43 ms; n-2 repetition
cost: bilinguals = 43 ms; monolinguals = 56 ms).
For error rates, the main effect of types of sequence was
significant [F (2, 380) = 10.536, p < 0.001, p2 = 0.053],
indicating that the participants were more error prone in
the ABA conditions (3.6%) than in the CAA conditions
(2.9%) or in the CBA conditions (3.2%) (all ps 
0.001). However, the CAA and the CBA conditions
did not differ (p = 0.351). No significant difference in
error rates between bilinguals (3%) and monolinguals
(3.4%) was found [group: F (1, 190) = 1.631, p = 0.203,
p2 = 0.009]; the interaction between types of sequence
and group was not significant, either [F (2, 380) = 2.322,
p = 0.100, p2 = 0.012]. These results indicated that the
two costs were similar in both groups (n-1 shift cost:
bilinguals = 0.7%; monolinguals = 0%; n-2 repetition
cost: bilinguals = 0.2%; monolinguals = 0.6%).
Correlations between the n-1 shift cost and the n-2
repetition cost
We proposed that if n-1 shift costs and n-2 repetition
costs originate from the same cognitive mechanism, we

should expect to find a negative correlation between the
magnitude of n-1 shift costs and that of n-2 repetition costs
across all participants. Before performing correlation
analyses, we examined the distribution of the switch costs
values for each group and excluded outliers from our data
(Tukey's test). The outlier free data set originating from
the application of this procedure allowed us to correlate
the two costs for 87 bilinguals and 96 monolinguals.
Importantly, the results relative to the switch costs, as
previously revealed (see above), remained unchanged
after the elimination of the outliers.7
To explore whether the n-1 shift cost and the n-2
repetition cost were related, we performed a correlation
analysis (Pearson's coefficient) for the two costs across
all participants. To assess whether the phenomenon was
similarly present for bilinguals and monolinguals, we
also conducted a correlation analysis for the two groups
separately. Interestingly, we found a significant negative

We performed one repeated-measures ANOVA with types of cost
(n-2 repetition and n-1 shift costs) as a within-subject factor and
group (bilinguals and monolinguals) as a between-subject factor. The
main effect of types of cost was not significant [F (1, 181) = 1.844,
p = 0.176, p2 = 0.010], suggesting that the magnitudes of the n1 shift cost and of the n-2 repetition cost were not different. The
main effect of group was not significant, either [F (1, 181) = 0.186,
p = 0.666, p2 = 0.001], suggesting that the two groups performed
similarly. Finally, the interaction between types of cost and group was
also not significant [F (1, 181) = 1.074, p = 0.301, p2 = 0.006].

correlation between the magnitudes of the n-1 shift
costs and the n-2 repetition costs across all participants
[r = -0.181, p = 0.014]. However, when the two groups
were taken apart, this correlation was significant for
the bilingual group [r = -0.297, p = 0.005] but not
for the monolingual group [r = -0.054, p = 0.601] (see
Figures 1, 2 and 3).
Furthermore, we calculated the significance of the
difference between the correlation coefficients obtained
among bilinguals and monolinguals (i.e., r-bil and rmono). We did so by using the Fisher r-to-z transformation
to convert each correlation coefficient into a z-score. Then,
by making use of the sample size employed to obtain each
coefficient, we compared the z-scores (see the formula in
Cohen & Cohen, 1983). The results revealed that r-bil was
significantly smaller than r-mono (z=-1.68, p = 0.047).
Correlations between the magnitudes of the switch
costs and the language-switching scores (BSWQ)
A certain amount of scientific work has recently
emphasised the importance of exploring the relationship
between different aspects of linguistic experience and
EC (e.g., Prior & Gollan, 2011; Verreyt, Woumans,
Vandelanotte, Szmalec & Duyck, 2015; Hartanto & Yang,
2016; Yang et al., 2016). Hence, this analysis aimed to
explore the variability in EC responses as a function
of a detailed characterisation of individual differences
in language switching, measured through the BSWQ
(Rodriguez-Fornells et al., 2012).
Hence, for Experiments 1 and 2 separately, we
performed a correlation analysis (Pearson's coefficient)
between the switch costs (n-1 shift and n-2 repetition
costs) and the BSWQ scores. Precisely, the switch costs
were correlated with (a) first-language (L1) switching
tendencies (the tendency to switch from the second
language [L2] to L1), (b) second-language switching
tendencies (the tendency to switch from L1 to L2), (c)
contextual switch (CS), (the frequency of switches in
particular contexts) and (d) unintended switch (US) (the
frequency of unconscious language switches).

The results are reported in Table 6. Interestingly,
although we did not find any significant correlation
in Experiment 1, we did find a significant correlation
between the n-2 repetition cost and the scores relative
to L2-switching tendencies in Experiment 2.
4. General discussion
The present study aimed to explore two main issues related
to the effects of bilingualism in task switching.
First, we intended to provide a conceptual replication of
the bilingualism effect on the n-2 repetition cost found by
Prior (2012). Importantly, this cognitive index (i.e., the n-2
repetition cost) has been considered particularly relevant
to determine how the experience of bilingualism shapes
an individual's EC system. In fact, it has been suggested
that the n-2 repetition cost captures the efficiency of an EC
mechanism that is crucial for bilingual language control,
that is, inhibitory control (e.g., Mayr & Keele, 2000; Gade,
Schuch, Druey & Koch, 2014). Hence, following Prior's
(2012) argument, the bilinguals' better inhibitory system
(due to their daily experience with inhibitory control
during language processing) should have resulted in
increased n-2 repetition costs compared to monolinguals.
The results of Experiment 1 are clearly at odds with this
prediction since we found that bilinguals' n-2 repetition
costs were similar to those of monolinguals. Interestingly,
we obtained the same results in Experiment 2. Hence,
across more than 200 participants, we did not find any
effect of bilingualism on the n-2 repetition cost.
Despite differences between our study and that of
Prior (2012), such as the number of tested participants
and the bilinguals' languages, the two studies are likely
comparable in their main properties. Hence, the available
evidence, along with other recent results (Babcock &
Vallesi, 2015; Branzi et al., 2016), casts some doubt on the
robustness and the reliability of the phenomenon itself.
It is also noteworthy that in our study, bilinguals and
monolinguals showed similar n-1 shift costs (Experiment
2). This result is consistent with that of Hernandez,
Martin, Barcelo & Costa's (2013) study, in which they
tested a large number of participants (145 bilinguals and
147 monolinguals) performing different versions of the
task-switching paradigm. Interestingly, Hernandez et al.
(2013) failed to observe any modulation of the n-1 shift
cost due to bilingualism. If we add the current set of
results to such a study, along with other recent evidence
(e.g., Paap & Greenberg, 2013; Paap & Sawi, 2014; de
Bruin et al., 2015; von Bastian et al., 2016), it appears that
the bilingualism advantage on the n-1 shift cost is rather
elusive and very limited in scope, if it indeed exists.
Overall, on one hand, the results concerning the
magnitudes (RTs) of the two costs suggest a limited
impact of bilingualism on some aspects of the EC system
and raise concerns about the generalisability of previous

observations (see also Paap & Greenberg, 2013; Paap
et al., 2015). On the other hand, these findings confirm
those of recent studies that revealed a lack of overlap
between the linguistic and the non-linguistic n-1 shift costs
and n-2 repetition costs (Calabria, Hernandez, Branzi &
Costa, 2012; Prior & Gollan, 2013; Babcock & Vallesi,
2015; Calabria, Branzi, Marne, Hernandez & Costa, 2015;
Cattaneo, Calabria, Marne, Gironell, Abutalebi & Costa,
2015; Branzi et al., 2016).
Along the same lines, even if we reported an overall
faster performance of bilinguals compared to monolinguals in Experiment 1, we failed to reveal any significant
difference between the groups in Experiment 2. It is
difficult to decide whether we should consider these results
in contrast to or in accord with the hypothesis of a bilingual
advantage in monitoring control (e.g., Costa et al., 2008,
2009). Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge
that this hypothesis has been strongly questioned in
recent years. For instance, from 2011 to 2014, bilingual
advantages in global RTs had been reported only in 13% of
the studies using conflict-resolution tasks (see Paap et al.,
2015). Failures in revealing such bilingual advantages
seem to be especially evident in those studies that should
be powerful enough to detect small effects due to the
large sample sizes employed (e.g., Hernandez et al., 2013;
Paap & Greenberg, 2013; Anton, Dunabeitia, Estevez,
Hernandez, Castillo, Fuentes, Davidson & Carreiras,
2014; Paap et al., 2014; von Bastian et al., 2016). Taking
into account the current literature, our findings do not
provide strong support for the hypothesis of a bilingual
advantage in monitoring control.
Regarding the second issue investigated in this study,
we also hypothesised a negative correlation between

the n-1 shift cost and the n-2 repetition cost across all
participants, to the extent to which these two costs would
reflect the efficiency of the same control mechanism (e.g.,
inhibitory control). However, we found such a correlation
in the bilingual group only.
A conceivable explanation for this finding is that
among bilinguals, the deployment of the same control
mechanism lies behind the two costs. One possibility is
that this mechanism is inhibitory control applied to the
n-1 task. To recall, a strong inhibition of the just executed
task would result in smaller n-1 shift costs and larger n-2
repetition costs. A low level of inhibitory control over the
n-1 task would lead to the opposite pattern. Interestingly,
the negative correlation found among bilinguals was
accompanied by similar magnitudes of switch costs.
Hence, it is possible that some of the bilinguals might
have applied high levels of inhibition to the n-1 tasks,
leading to small n-1 shift costs and large n-2 repetition
costs. Others might have applied low levels of inhibition
to the n-1 tasks, resulting in large n-1 shift costs and small
n-2 repetition costs.
Regardless of the merits of this explanation, it is
unclear why monolinguals did not show this correlation.
Indeed, both bilinguals and monolinguals showed similar
magnitudes of the two switch costs, suggesting that they
were similarly engaged in n-2 repetition and n-1 shift
costs. One possibility is that monolinguals might have
tended to apply a similar degree of inhibition to n-1 tasks,
and this sort of clustering around a common inhibition
level would not have allowed for a negative correlation
between the costs to emerge.
Another tentative explanation is that differential
findings relative to the correlation between the two

206

Francesca M. Branzi, Marco Calabria, Miriam Gade, Luis J. Fuentes and Albert Costa

costs might reflect qualitative differences related to the
experience with bilingual language control. We propose
that the presence of a correlation likely suggests the
same mechanism behind the two costs (see also Branzi
et al., 2016). The lack of such a correlation might thus
indicate that the n-1 shift cost and the n-2 repetition
cost measure, at least in part, different mechanisms.
In this regard, it might be that bilinguals employ just
one mechanism (which might be inhibitory control)
during task switching. Interestingly, we also recently
found a negative correlation between the two costs
during language switching, suggesting that bilinguals
might also apply the same `strategy' when switching
between languages (see Branzi et al., 2016). In contrast,
monolinguals might employ other mechanisms besides
inhibitory control, which would affect the n-1 shift cost
in task switching (in fact, the n-2 repetition cost would
specifically measure inhibitory control). Therefore, the
lack of correlation that we observed among monolinguals
might be due to the variability added by these other
processes that were measured through the n-1 shift cost.
Taken together, results from this and our previous study
(Branzi et al., 2016) might suggest qualitatively different
strategies between bilinguals and monolinguals during
task switching. Consistent with this interpretation, Garbin,
Sanjuan, Forn, Bustamante, Rodriguez-Pujadas, Belloch,
Hernandez, Costa & Avila (2010) showed that when
performing non-linguistic cognitive tasks, bilinguals used
different brain areas compared to monolinguals. Crucially,
these brain areas were those generally involved in
bilingual language control, leading to the hypothesis
that the qualitative difference in EC between bilinguals
and monolinguals might be related to different linguistic
experiences.
Nonetheless, we are strongly convinced that additional
empirical evidence is needed to provide a clear theoretical
explanation for these findings.
5. Conclusion
The present study provides two main contributions. First,
it shows that bilingualism does not seem to affect the
magnitude of the n-2 repetition cost in RTs. Consistent
with previous findings (e.g., Branzi et al., 2016), this result
suggests that the n-2 repetition cost may not be a reliable
index to support the hypothesis of a bilingualism effect
on EC. This study has also failed to reveal any effect of
bilingualism on the n-1 shift cost. This finding, along with
previous ones (e.g., Hernandez et al., 2013), suggests that
future research on the effects of bilingualism should not
be confined to the effects of the magnitude of the switch
costs.
Second, this study reveals qualitative differences
between bilinguals and monolinguals relative to the
negative correlation between the magnitudes of switch

costs. This is a rather new finding and may suggest that
bilinguals and monolinguals employ different cognitive
strategies to cope with interference in task switching.
Future research is needed to assess the reliability of this
result and whether it is relatable to specific aspects of
bilingualism.
Appendix
Description of monolingual and bilingual samples
All participants (both bilinguals and monolinguals) who
were recruited for the two experiments lived in the same
country (Spain). Hence, despite their exposure to the same
socio-cultural context, they differed in their language
history. The monolinguals who were included in both
experiments were students at the University of Murcia.
The bilinguals in both experiments were Catalan-Spanish
early and highly proficient bilinguals and were students at
the Pompeu Fabra University.
Catalan-Spanish bilinguals
The Catalan-Spanish bilinguals who participated in
Experiments 1 and 2 were recruited in Catalonia,
specifically in Barcelona. Catalonia is a bilingual
region in Spain, where both Catalan and Spanish are
official languages. In many families, both languages are
spoken, and the current educational system is completely
bilingual. At the end of primary school, children are
able to read, write, speak and understand both Catalan
and Spanish. In primary school and in high school,
classes are taught in both languages although Catalan is
more predominant. University classes and tests are taught
and administered in both Catalan and Spanish. Radio
and television broadcasts are aired in both languages,
newspaper articles are written in Catalan and Spanish,
and the official bureaucracy can be handled in either
language. All the Catalan-Spanish bilinguals who were
tested in the experiments passed the Catalan-Spanish
language proficiency exam that is required for admission
to universities. This exam requires a very high level
of proficiency in various aspects (grammar, vocabulary,
etc.). In Barcelona, Catalan-Spanish conversations are
prevalent in both private and professional settings. This
promotes a balanced use of the two languages, as well
as situations in which (even if not needed) language
switching in bilingual groups occurs naturally.
For example, it is common to observe that an
interlocutor speaks in Spanish to a particular person and
in Catalan to another during the same conversation, even
if all three speakers are highly proficient bilinguals (even
among members of the same family).
All the Catalan-Spanish bilinguals who were tested
in this study were exposed early (before the age of two

On the bilingualism effect
years) to both languages in similar proportions, and they
kept using these in this way until the time of testing.
The bilinguals were asked to rate their proficiency skills
in reading, writing, speaking and comprehension in their
two native languages, as well as in any foreign language
in which they were better at (see Tables 1 and 3).
Spanish monolinguals
The Spanish monolinguals who participated in
Experiments 1 and 2 were recruited in the Region
of Murcia (autonomous community), especially in
Murcia, a monolingual city in Spain. These monolingual
participants were not functionally fluent in any other
language despite formal foreign language instruction in
school (see also Prior & MacWhinney, 2010; Prior, 2012;
Hernandez et al., 2013).
Importantly, no monolingual reported currently using
or having used in the past any language other than Spanish
with relatives (including parents and siblings), partners,
friends or in an educational or work setting. In fact, as
shown in Tables 1 and 3, the monolinguals did not report a
high level of proficiency in a foreign language. They were
asked to rate their proficiency skills in reading, writing,
speaking and comprehension in their native language, as
well as in any foreign language they were better at (see
Tables 1 and 3).
