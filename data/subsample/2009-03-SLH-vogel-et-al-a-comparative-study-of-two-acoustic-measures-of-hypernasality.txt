Purpose: This study aimed to compare 2 quantitative acoustic measures of nasality in
children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) and healthy controls using formalized
perceptual assessment as a guide.
Method: Fifty participants (23 children with CLP and 27 age- and gender-matched
healthy controls) aged between 4 and 12 years produced a variety of high and
low vowels that allowed perceptual ratings of nasal resonance severity as well as
acoustic analysis of spectral changes. Two objective measures of nasality were used:
1/3 octave spectra analysis and the voice low tone high tone ratio. Each respective
technique has been evaluated in previous research, and their potential as an effective
means of detecting changes in nasal resonance has been demonstrated.
Results: Only 1/3 octave spectra analysis differentiated between participants with
hypernasal speech and those perceived to have normal nasal resonance. Significant
differences were also observed between varying levels of perceived severity on vowels
within nonnasalized phonemic environments (/pI t/, /t Ip/).
Conclusions: Perceptual judgment remains the primary means of evaluating levels of
nasality in children with CLP. However, the development and validation of easy-to-use
objective techniques remains an important goal for effective clinical and empirical
practice.

erceptual judgment of nasality remains an important and necessary
part of any clinical speech investigation (Kuehn & Moller, 2000).
However, the reliability of both inter- and intrarater perceptual
judgment continues to be contested within the literature (Sell, 2005). The
role of perceptual judgment in complex populations like cleft lip and
palate (CLP) is made more challenging by the multifaceted nature of the
voice (Bzoch, 1979). The relative impact of varying aspects of the voice
(e.g., pitch, loudness, resonance) can further influence the signal perceived by a listener (Zraick, 1999). In addition, the diverse array of perceptual assessment tools available to clinicians contributes to a lack of
congruence within the field (Kreiman, Gerratt, Kempster, Erman, &
Berke, 1993).
Perceptual judgment remains the primary means of evaluating levels of nasality in children with CLP. Nevertheless, the development and
validation of an easy-to-use complementary instrumental assessment
has been the subject of much discussion and remains an important goal.
The inclusion of quantitative measurements in a clinical assessment battery would not only contribute to the overall accuracy of an investigation
but also allow other clinicians to directly use previously acquired data
without concern for reduced test-retest reliability. Several quantitative
methods have been developed to measure aspects of nasal resonance, for

example, the Nasometer (KayPENTAX, Lincoln Park,
NJ). The Nasometer measures acoustic output from the
oral and nasal cavities and calculates the ratio between
competing acoustic signals to produce a nasalance score
(Dalston, Warren, & Dalston, 1991). The system, which
is in widespread use, incorporates a commercially available headset with oral and nasal microphones separated
by a baffle plate to limit mixing of signals and specially
designed software for analysis of the acquired data. The
Nasometer has been shown to correlate well with perceptual studies (Hardin, Van Demark, Morris, & Payne,
1992; Sweeney & Sell, 2008); however, measures derived
from the Nasometer (KayPENTAX) may not be interchangeable between other devices, including the OroNasal System (Glottal Enterprises, Syracuse, NY) or the
NasalView (Tiger DRS, Inc., Seattle, WA; Bressmann,
2005; Bressmann, Klaiman, & Fischbach, 2006; Lewis
& Watterson, 2003). In addition to nasometry, several
other methods have been developed to measure aspects
of nasality and/or velopharyngeal functioning, including
the Horii Oral-Nasal Coupling Index (Horii, 1980), sonography (Dillenschneider, Zaleski, & Greiner, 1973), oral
breath pressure ratios (Weinberg & Shanks, 1971), and the
Palatal Efficiency Ratings Computed InstantaneouslySpeech Aeromechanics Research System (PERCI-SAR;
MicroTronics Corp., Chapel Hill, NC). Each system offers
an instrumental adjunct to perceptual judgment; however, their application is often limited by a combination
of factors, including a lack of comparative studies directly
contrasting each technique, clinical uncertainty relating to the sensitivity and specificity of competing methodologies, the popularity of imaging studies (typically,
nasendoscopy and videofluoroscopy) that provide direct
information on velopharyngeal insufficiency (Bekir et al.,
2008; Rowe & D'Antonio, 2005), and the ease of commercially available techniques like the Nasometer.
Nasality can be evaluated using spectral analysis of
the speech signal; however, some caveats need to be acknowledged before adopting the technique. Acoustic techniques often entail laborious analysis regimes that can
require extensive user expertise; the appropriateness
of selected stimuli has not been rigorously evaluated
(Watterson, Hinton, & McFarlane, 1996; Watterson,
Lewis, Allord, Sulprizio, & O'Neill, 2007; Watterson,
Lewis, & Foley-Homan, 1999), and there is a dearth of
comparative studies investigating the sensitivity and
specificity of available acoustic methodologies. One possible consequence of these factors, combined with the popularity of existing investigative techniques (e.g., imaging,
nasometry), is that spectral analysis is yet to be widely
used by clinicians and researchers alike. Nevertheless,
acoustic techniques do offer some potential, as little expertise is required to record speech samples, and repeated
samples can be easily obtained, making acoustic techniques appropriate for therapeutic practice. Furthermore,

the choice of acquisition methodology has been extensively investigated (Deliyski, Evans, & Shaw, 2005;
Vogel & Maruff, 2008), and the stimuli used during spectral techniques can be simultaneously acquired during existing perceptual assessment protocols, as the
same stimuli are often suitable for evaluation in both
methodologies.
Two common spectral analytical procedures reported
in the nasality literature are one-third octave spectra
analysis (Kataoka, Michi, Okabe, Miura, & Yoshida,
1996; Kataoka, Warren, Zajac, Mayo, & Lutz, 2001;
Yoshida et al., 2000) and the voice low tone to high tone
ratio (VLHR; G. Lee, Wang, Yang, & Kuo, 2006; G. Lee,
Yang, & Kuo, 2003). Both methods focus on intensity
variation around the first, second, and third frequency
formants, an acoustic pattern commonly observed in
hypernasal speech (Chen, 1996; House & Stevens, 1958;
Huffman, 1990; Kent, Weismer, Kent, Vorperian, & Duffy,
1999).
One-third octave spectra analysis was initially developed by Kataoka and colleagues in the late 1980s as
an alternative spectral approach to evaluating hypernasality. Kataoka et al. (1996) then went on to test the
validity of the technique by eliciting sustained vowels
(/i:/) from a mixed population of adults and children
judged to have hypernasal speech and a group of healthy
controls. The ( / i:/ ) vowel was considered the best stimulus for determining nasality, as high vowels are characterized by greater velar height and seem to require far
less nasal coupling in order to be perceived as nasal,
compared with low vowels (Fant, 1960; Hajek & Maeda,
2000; House & Stevens, 1956; Moll, 1962). By examining
the one-third octave spectra, differences were observed
between the acoustic profile of controls and a heterogeneous group of participants (diagnosis of cleft palate
and/or velopharyngeal incompetence) with hypernasal
speech (Kataoka et al., 1996). In addition, participants
judged to have hypernasal speech were found to have an
increase in intensity between the first and second formants around 1 kHz and a reduction in signal intensity
between the second and third formants. Kataoka and
colleagues (2001) then extended the potential of onethird octave spectra by examining the role of the technique in specific populations, namely, children with and
without cleft palate. Isolated /i:/ vowels were elicited
from five children with normal nasal resonance and
32 children with cleft palate. Once again, differences in
intensity were observed between the groups at specific
frequency bands (i.e., 1 kHz, 1.6 kHz, and 2.5 kHz).
More recently, the one-third octave spectra analysis has been expanded into more diverse clinical populations presenting with hypernasal speech (dysarthria,
maxillectomy, cleft palate). A. S. Lee et al. (2003) sought
to examine the generalizability of one-third octave spectra

analyses by exploring the effect of diverse etiologies
on spectral profiles. The authors used nonnasal words in
consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) combinations (e.g.,
/pI t/, /tIp/) and found that participants with hypernasal
speech tended to have higher intensity levels at bands
centered at 630 Hz, 800 Hz, and 1000 Hz, as well as
lower intensity levels for the band centered at 2.5 KHz
compared with speakers with normal resonance. This
work was continued by exploring the sensitivity and applicability of diverse stimuli, namely, four vowels (e.g.,
/a/, //, /u/, /i/) in varying phonetic environments (A. S.
Lee, Ciocca, & Whitehill, 2004). Participants were required to produce 18 Cantonese single words, 9 loaded
with oral stops at initial and final positions and 9 loaded
with nasal stops in the same positions. The authors concluded that individuals with normal and hypernasal
resonance could be distinguished from one another on
the basis of their intensity spectrum on the /i:/ and //
vowels.
Both studies demonstrate the robust and generalizable nature of one-third octave spectra analysis when
comparing normal and hypernasal speech through varying stimuli and population groups. However, an alternative acoustic methodology, VLHR (G. Lee et al., 2003),
also claims to be a reliable and accurate evaluation of
nasal resonance.
The VLHR was developed as a quantitative acoustic
measure based on the intensity spectrum to evaluate
nasal resonance. In an early study, CV (e.g., /m/:) speech
samples were elicited for 5 s before and after treatment for
nasal congestion from 10 individuals with nasal blockage (G. Lee et al., 2003). Using the VLHR technique, defined as a division of low-frequency and high-frequency
power as identified in the sound spectrum and expressed
in decibels, the before and after tests were compared.
The VLHR increased significantly after decongestant
treatment compared with pretreatment measures, suggesting that VLHR increases as hypernasality increases. Following this early work, the same researchers
elicited sustained vowels (/a:/) and a nasalized /a:/ vowel
from eight hypernasal adults (G. Lee et al., 2006). The
spectral intensity was once again divided into low and
high frequencies using a specific cutoff point (600 Hz) to
divide the spectrum. Low-frequency power was defined
as the summation of intensity from 65 Hz to 600 Hz, and
high-frequency power was defined as the summation of
intensity from 600 Hz to 8 kHz. Higher VLHR measures
were observed in nasalized sounds (/a:/) when compared
with oral sounds (/a:/), providing further evidence in support of this technique.
Similar to perceptual judgments, one-third octave
spectra analysis and the VLHR rely on changes in intensity inherent in nasalized speech (Jones, 2000). Therefore, we aimed to compare two voice acoustic measures
objectively in the present study: one-third octave spectra

analysis and VLHR analysis of nasality with perceptual
judgments of speech in a group of Malay-speaking children. Direct comparison of existing methodologies will
assist in the development of a qualitative framework on
which clinicians and researchers may base their acoustic
nasality assessments.

Method
Participants
Fifty native speakers of the Malay language (23 children with CLP judged perceptually to have hypernasal
speech and 27 age- and gender-matched controls) aged
between 4 and 12 years were recruited to participate
in an investigation of the specificity and sensitivity of
selected spectral analysis techniques. Participants with
CLP (11 females, 12 males, aged between 5;2 [years;
months] and 12;9 [M = 8.9 years, SD = 2.2]) were recruited from a list of patients receiving speech and language therapy services from the Otorhinolaryngology
Department at Kuala Lumpur General Hospital (GHKL)
in Malaysia.
The CLP participants were included in the study if
they had a diagnosis of congenital CLP with or without
syndromes, if they had undergone primary surgery to repair the cleft palate, and if they were attending or had
been referred for speech therapy services at GHKL. One
participant recruited for the study was suspected to have
an associated syndrome; however, the actual diagnosis
was unspecified. Two participants diagnosed with Pierre
Robin sequence, a participant diagnosed with Goldenhar
syndrome, and a participant diagnosed with van der
Woude syndrome were excluded from the study, as they
did not fulfill the inclusion criteria.
Healthy controls (13 males and 14 females, aged between 5;3 and 13 years [M = 9.1 years, SD = 2.2]) were
recruited from a local government school in Kuala Lumpur
and were children without speech and language difficulties and normal resonance as judged by an experienced
speech pathologist. Participants were excluded if they
presented with upper respiratory tract infections or nasal
congestion on the day of assessment.
All participants recruited in the study passed a
speech, language, oral-motor, and hearing screen. Participants with a blocked nose or with nasal congestion
as assessed during the oral-motor examination by the
second author (HMI) were excluded from the study.

Procedure
Perceptual ratings of hypernasality and the speech
stimuli used for acoustic analysis were simultaneously
recorded during live sessions.

Perceptual Assessment
Perceptual ratings of hypernasality were recorded
using the Great Ormond Street Speech Assessment '98
Speech Profile for children with cleft palate and/or velopharyngeal dysfunction (revised; Great Ormond Street
Speech Assessment 1998 [GOS.SP.ASS.'98]; Sell, Harding,
& Grunwell, 1999). Hypernasality was scored using a
4-point scale, where Grade 0 represented normal resonance and higher grades indicated increasing levels of
severity (i.e., 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Perceptual ratings of resonance were made using a combination of speech tasks that included sustained vowels,
syllable repetitions, sentence repetitions, and three read
passages. The read passages were developed by the
second author (HMI) and contained varying percentages of nasal phonemes. Two speech-language pathologists independently rated the speech samples for levels
of nasality. The raters were both qualified speech pathologists who graduated from the Universiti Kebangsaan
Malaysia (UKM) and were competent in Malay. Both
raters were trained in using the GOS.SP.ASS.'98 rating scale prior to commencement of data collection. For
each participant, each rater provided one overall perceptual rating immediately after each participant completed the set of stimuli, based on the GOS.SP.ASS.'98
rating scale. If any discrepancy arose between raters,
ratings were discussed at the end of the session, and a
final rating agreed upon by both raters was given. Perceptual evaluation of the control group was conducted
using the same process; however, as controls were spread
over several different locations, all evaluations of resonance were conducted by the second author (HMI) only.

Speech Stimuli
All participants produced two sustained vowels (/a:/
and /i:/) three times each for approximately 5 s as well as
two CVC words containing nonnasal consonants (/pI t/
and /tIp/) on five consecutive trials. The speech tasks
were performed at a comfortable loudness and pitch level
following the assessor 's model.
Interrater and intrarater reliability study. An interrater and intrarater reliability study was completed
using 40 speech samples (e.g., passages with varying
proportion of nasal phonemes) by three raters to ensure
the reliability of the perceptual ratings made. Two of the
raters (the second author [HMI] and HH) were involved
in the present study, and one rater (SZ) was recruited as
an independent party. HH and SZ (see Acknowledgments
section) were experienced speech therapists and worked
in cleft teams in their respective hospitals. Each rater
made independent ratings after listening to the audiorecorded stimuli. The speech samples were rerated after
3 weeks by the same raters. At each time point, the

raters were blind to the recordings, and samples were
randomized.
Percentage of agreement and kappa (k) scores for perceptual ratings were calculated using STATA 10 (Stata
Corp., College Station, TX) at a 95% significance level.
The results indicated good interrater agreement between
the three raters who participated in the reliability study
(k = .78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: .65-0.97). The
results for intrarater reliability indicated fair to good
agreement, with k scores ranging from .66 to .91 and
percentage of agreements ranging between 80% and
95% agreement. Findings of the reliability study confirmed that raters provided reliable and consistent perceptual judgments when evaluating resonance using the
GOS.SP.ASS.'98 rating scales and definitions.
Acquisition methodology. Speech stimuli were recorded in a quiet room using a solid state recorder
(Marantz PMD 670 flash recorder; D&M Professional,
Kawasaki, Japan) and an AKG C420 head-mounted cardioid condenser microphone (AKG Acoustics Harman
ProGmbH, Munich, Germany) based on the manufacturer 's recommendations. The microphone was positioned
at a 45 angle approximately 8 cm from the mouth, and
recordings were digitized at a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz
and 16-bit quantization.

Acoustic Analysis
Acoustic data were analyzed by the first author
(APV) in accordance with the prescribed protocols for
VLHR (G. Lee et al., 2006, 2003) and one-third octave
spectra analysis (Kataoka et al., 1996, 2001). VLHR was
calculated by dividing the spectrum into a low-frequency
power section (LFP) and a high-frequency power section
(HFP) artificially with the cutoff frequency of 600 Hz.
LFP was defined as the summation of the power from
50 Hz to 600 Hz, and HFP was defined as the summation
of the power from 600 Hz to 8063 Hz. VLHR was defined
as the division of LFP into HFP, expressed in decibels (G.
Lee et al., 2006), and was calculated using the equation
VLHR = 10 x log10 (LFP/HFP). VLHR was used to
calculate values on the sustained vowel tasks (/a:/, /i:/)
and the middle 50-ms sections of the vowel in both CVC
words (/pI t/, /tIp/).
One-third octave spectra calculations were based on
methodology developed by Kataoka et al. (2001) and
A. S. Lee et al. (2003). Speech samples were filtered using
20 one-third octave bandpass filters, with center frequencies from 50 Hz to 8063 Hz. As the speech samples were
produced using the participant's natural amplitude, all
spectra were normalized by subtracting the amplitude
value of each one-third octave spectra band from the
amplitude value of the band that contained the f0. The
bands that had higher amplitudes than the f0 band had

positive dB values, and the bands that had lower amplitudes than the f0 band had negative dB values. Onethird octave spectra calculations were computed on the
sustained vowels (/i:/, /a:/) and the middle 50-ms sections
of the vowel in both CVC words (/pIt/, /tIp/).
Reliability data for acoustic measurements were
acquired by reanalyzing 25% of the original data set and
comparing these results with the complete data set used
in the study. All stimuli yielded high levels of test-retest
reliability (see Table 1).

All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 10
(StataCorp, College Station, TX), and significance levels were set at p < .05. One-third octave spectra mean
amplitudes (dB) were calculated for frequency bands
every one third of an octave between 50 Hz and 8063 Hz
on all samples (/a:/, /i:/, /pIt/, /tIp/). However, statistical
analysis was only conducted on those frequency bands
(between 476 Hz and 3089 Hz) that had demonstrated
their sensitivity to hypernasality in previous work (Kataoka
et al., 2001; A. S. Lee et al., 2003). Furthermore, limiting
the number of frequency bands included in the analysis
reduces the chance of Type II error. VLHR scores for each
stimulus were derived from the following equation: 10 x
log10 (LFP/HFP). Prior to conducting statistical analysis, all data were examined for normality and homogeneity of variance using the Shapiro-Wilks's test and
visual inspection of histograms across each group and
each stimulus. Normality was violated on most data
sets; therefore, nonparametric comparisons were used.
Between-group differences (cleft and control) for each
acoustic method (VLHR and one-third octave spectra)
were determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-
Whitney) test. Differences according to subgroup of perceived level of hypernasality (normal, mild, moderate,
severe) for each acoustic method were analyzed via oneway analysis of variance by ranks or by the Kruskal-
Wallis test. In order to compensate for low subgroup
numbers, a post hoc analysis of the data was conducted
using a significance level of .004. This level was calculated by using STATA 10 according to a number of criteria including participant numbers, number of assessments,
degrees of freedom, and the overall level of significance
(Osborn, 2000).

All participants in the control group (n = 27) were

have varying levels of hypernasality and scored between
mild and severe. Of the participants, 5 were perceived
to have mild hypernasality, 7 were perceived to have
moderate hypernasality, and 11 presented with severe
hypernasality.

Perceptual Ratings and VLHR
A summary of VLHR scores and interquartile ranges
is provided in Table 2. According to data derived from
VLHR analysis, we observed no differences between control and CLP groups on all stimuli except /i:/. Therefore,
we used a Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test to
compare the production of /i:/ between groups (z = 0.22,
p = .82). As these results do not reflect the pattern of
change described in previous work (G. Lee et al., 2006),
we conducted no further tests of significance on the remaining stimuli.
We examined VLHR scores by severity levels on the
basis of perceptual ratings of hypernasality (see Table 3).
Comparison of median and interquartile ranges for each
stimulus across perceptual ratings of nasality revealed
an increase in VLHR score for participants with moderate
hypernasality on /a:/, /i:/, and /pI t/ samples. VLHR scores
for participants with mild and severe hypernasality were

Comparison of cleft and control groups using the Krukal-

of hypernasality ratings for /a:/ ( p = .289), /i:/ ( p = .823),
/pIt/ ( p = .280), and /tIp/ ( p = .182).

Perceptual Ratings and One-Third
Octave Spectra Analysis
We used a two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test to
compare amplitudes between cleft and control groups
for /a:/, /i:/, /pIt /, and /tIp/ stimuli across each frequency
band. We observed no significant differences between
groups for the one-third octave spectra of /i:/ and /a:/
( p > .05). However, the spectra of /pIt / and /tIp/ revealed
significant differences between controls and participants
with CLP.
Figure 1 shows the relative amplitudes of the cleft
and control groups for the stimulus /pIt/. Median amplitudes of the CLP group were higher than the control
group between 476 Hz and 1904 Hz, and we observed the
opposite at 2400 Hz and 3023 Hz. Figure 1 shows that
amplitudes of both groups decreased at 3809 Hz. Results

of the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed that
amplitudes in the cleft group were significantly higher
than those for the control group at frequency bands
centered around 476 Hz (z = 2.54, p = .011), 600 Hz (z =
2.70, p = .007), 755 Hz (z = 2.74, p = .006), 952 Hz (z = 3.01,
p = .003), and 1.2 kHz (z = 2.81, p = .005). On the contrary,
group differences failed to reach significance at frequency
bands centered at 2.4 kHz and 3023 Hz.
Figure 2 illustrates a similar pattern of spectral
change between groups for /tIp/, as was observed in Figure 1 (/pIt/). Median amplitudes for the FLP group were

centered around 600 Hz (z = 2.31, p = .002), 755 Hz (z =
2.58, p = .001), 952 Hz (z = 2.54, p = .011), 1.2 kHz (z =
2.48, p = .013), and 1.5 kHz (z = 2.48, p = .013). We observed no significant differences between groups at frequency bands centered around 2.4 kHz, 3023 Hz, and
3809 Hz. As we noted no differences between groups for
/a:/ and /i:/ samples, we only conducted further analyses
of differences in perceived levels of hypernasality on the
stimuli /tIp/ and /pIt/.
Results from the Kruskal-Wallis test for the stimulus /pIt/ indicated that amplitude values at 952 Hz,
k(49) = 9.44, p = .024, and at 1200 Hz, k(49) = 8.57,
p = .024, were sensitive to differences between perceptual ratings of hypernasality within subgroups. The data
in Figure 3 highlight the differences between participants with perceived normal resonance (according to the
GOS.SP.ASS.'98 rating scale) and participants presenting with severe hypernasality. For the frequency band
centered at 952 Hz, participants presenting with normal resonance yielded the lowest amplitude levels (Mdn =
-15.49 dB, SD = 2.27 dB), whereas participants perceived
to have severe hypernasality had the highest amplitude

ROC analysis. We conducted ROC analysis for each
of the frequency bands that showed significant differences between the median amplitudes of the cleft and
comparison groups for /tIp/ and /pIt/. The accuracy of
the method depends on how well the test separates the
group being tested into those with and without hypernasality. Accuracy is measured by the area under the
ROC curve. An area of 1 represents a perfect test, and an
area of .5 represents an unusable test (Fawcett, 2006).
The area under the curve and 95% CIs summarized in

Specificity and sensitivity. On the basis of the results
of the ROC curves, we selected specific cutoff values for
each frequency band to determine test sensitivity and
specificity values. In order to establish the validity of the
one-third octave analysis as an objective measure for detecting hypernasality, we chose the cutoff value to minimize false negatives. The specificity, sensitivity, and
overall agreement between perceptual ratings of hypernasality and amplitude values of the one-third octave
analysis at each frequency are summarized in Tables 5
(/tIp/) and 6 (/pIt/). We did not calculate measures of sensitivity and specificity on the data derived from the VLHR,
as this method did not reveal any significant differences
between participants judged to have hypernasal speech
and those with normal nasal resonance.
Sensitivity values were higher than specificity values in each of the stimuli, due to the cutoff point selected
from the ROC analysis. Test specificity, sensitivity, and
overall agreement between perceptual ratings of hypernasality and cutoff scores (dB) using the one-third octave
analysis were consistent with results derived from the
ROC analysis.

Discussion
In the present study, we aimed to compare two quantitative acoustic measures of nasality in children with
CLP and healthy controls using perceptual assessment
as a guide. Previous reports of both one-third octave
spectra analysis and the VLHR have demonstrated the
potential of acoustic techniques for accurately discriminating between hypernasal and normal nasal resonance
in adult and pediatric populations (Kataoka et al., 1996;
G. Lee et al., 2006). However, in the present study, only
one-third octave spectra analyses differentiated between
participants with hypernasal speech and those perceived
to have normal nasal resonance. Using this technique,
we observed significant differences between the spectral
profile of participants with hypernasal speech and controls on /i/ vowels within voiceless plosive phonemic environments (i.e., /pIt/, /tIp/). Specifically, one-third octave
analysis showed overall agreement with formalized perceptual judgment in 68% of cases on specific frequency
bands. Conversely, the VLHR technique did not deliver
any significant differences in measures of nasality between control and experimental groups.

did not reveal any significant differences between
participants with perceived hypernasality and healthy
controls. Therefore, measures of sensitivity and specificity were not calculated. Despite trialing a combination of high and low vowels in a relatively large cohort,
our results differed from earlier work in which adult populations were used (G. Lee et al., 2006, 2003). The first
published study documenting the VLHR algorithm
elicited /m:/ from 10 adults with nasal obstruction
( hyponasality; G. Lee et al., 2003). The authors calculated the VLHR by dividing the intensity spectrum
into high and low frequencies using the fundamental
frequency (f0) of each participant as a guide rather than
using an arbitrary frequency cutoff point, as was applied
in the present work. In contrast, a second published article by G. Lee et al. (2006) discussed the findings of two
small experiments in which (a) eight adults with palatal
fistula producing /a:/ on which the present study was
based and (b) eight adults with normal nasal resonance
producing a nasalized /a:/ and nonnasalized /a:/ used the
VLHR algorithm with a static cutoff frequency of 600 Hz
(G. Lee et al., 2006). Despite varying the methodology of
each experiment, significant differences were observed
between participants with hyper-/hyponasality and those
with normal nasal resonance in all three experiments.
Division of the intensity spectra using an arbitrary cutoff point of 600 Hz was hypothesized to capture amplitude changes resulting from altered nasal resonance.
Increases in the amplitude of frequencies between F1
and F2 as well as decreases in the amplitude above F2
have been linked to hypernasality, and these changes
were thought to be captured via VLHR (G. Lee et al.,
2006). Nevertheless, changes in amplitude across F1 and
F2 observed in the present study (as evidenced by onethird octave spectra analysis) did not manifest in significant increases in VLHR for participants judged to have
hypernasal speech. In addition, VLHR failed to discriminate between perceived levels of hypernasality when the
acoustic output was correlated with severity ratings derived from the GOS.SP.ASS.'98.

One-Third Octave Spectra
Speakers with hypernasality provided significantly
different spectral profiles compared with controls, particularly between the first and second formants. Hypernasal speakers producing /pIt/ had higher amplitudes at
frequency bands between 476 Hz and 1200 Hz, and on
/tIp/ at frequency bands between 600 Hz and 1511 Hz.
This pattern of additional spectral peaks has been observed in several acoustic studies of nasality; however,
the majority of these studies also report a decrease in
amplitude between F2 and F3 (Chen, 1996; Hattori,
Yamamoto, & Fujimura, 1958; House & Stevens, 1956;
Yoshida et al., 2000), a pattern only observed qualitatively

1648

in the present work. In addition, isolated vowels (/i:/, /a:/)
yielded similar amplitudes at all frequency bands for both
hypernasal and control speakers. These results differ
from the few pediatric studies in which the one-third octave spectra is used, as Kataoka et al. (2001) found significant differences in amplitude between experimental
and control groups on isolated vowels (i.e., /i:/). Despite
these differences, our results confirm some of the findings
of earlier research by Kataoka et al. (2001), who also
found increased amplitude in speakers with hypernasality between 1 kHz and 1.6 kHz, and by the work of A. S.
Lee et al. (2003, 2004), who observed that adult participants with hypernasality had significantly higher
amplitudes for frequency bands centered at 630 Hz,
800 Hz, and 1000 Hz when producing high vowels (i.e.,
/i/).
One-third octave analysis achieved a modest level
of agreement with the perceptual assessments. Despite
reaching moderate levels of sensitivity (as high as 78%
on some frequency bands), results from the one-third octave analysis yielded unremarkable levels of specificity
(averaging just over 50% for stimulus /tIp / ).

Symptom Severity and Spectral Analysis
The role of symptom severity on spectral amplitude
profiles has seldom been considered in acoustic investigations of nasality. In the present study, we used a
standardized perceptual assessment of symptom severity to look at the impact of acoustic changes on perceived
output. Interestingly, only those participants judged to
have severe hypernasality using the perceptual assessment were differentiated from controls using one-third
octave spectra analysis. These results bring into question the clinical value of these particular measures of
nasal resonance, as the real clinical need for objective
measurement lies in the capacity to discriminate between
mild and moderate levels of severity, not in distinguishing between normal resonance and severe hypernasality.
Moreover, the results suggest there is a discrepancy between the perceived severity of a speaker and his or
her actual acoustic signal. Watterson et al. (2007) investigated the effect of high and low vowels on listener
perception of hypernasality and found that listener reliability was influenced by vowel content. Similarly,
results of the present study point to a distinction between
perceived levels of hypernasality and aspects of the
acoustic signal that correspond to those perceptions. This
discrepancy illustrates the simultaneous potential and
inadequacy of acoustic measures of hypernasality. Clinicians are unlikely to adopt techniques that are incapable of differentiating between more subtle changes in
a patient's vocal presentation, especially when those
changes are easily identified perceptually. Nevertheless,
acoustic investigation of nasal resonance continues to

The Role of Spectral Assessment
of Nasality in Clinical Settings

Conclusion

Voice acoustic measures of nasality are not universally used in clinical or empirical work. However, the
present study and previous research have demonstrated
the potential for wider application of acoustic investigations into nasality. Several reasons exist for the slow
uptake of spectral analysis, including ambiguity in the
literature regarding appropriate acoustic methodology, as few studies, if any, have directly compared techniques; acoustic analysis can be laborious compared with
more user friendly devices (e.g., Nasometer); the popularity and excellent face validity of imaging techniques
(e.g., endoscopy); and the extent to which public health
organizations provide access and funding for new and
largely unproven assessment techniques. Wider application of this technique is further limited by the uncertainty and significance of selected frequency bands
within the spectra. Until these empirical contradictions
are rectified and experiments are conducted that evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of these
methods, clinicians and funding bodies will be reluctant to use spectral analysis as an adjunct to perceptual
judgment.
An additional barrier to the acceptance of objective
measures of nasality in general can be attributed to continued reliance on perceptual evaluation. Despite pressure
in the international literature for better accountability and quantitative judgments (John, Sell, Sweeney,
Harding-Bell, & Williams, 2006; Kent, 1996), many clinicians continue to use a combination of objective (predominantly imaging) and subjective tools within their
assessment battery. Carding, Carlson, Epstein, Mathieson,
and Shewell (2001), among others, have outlined the
limitations of perceptual voice analysis, sighting poor
inter-/intrarater reliability of analysis (Bassich & Ludlow,
1986), disparity in the design of the available perceptual
rating scales, inherent variability of the human voice,
and difficulties interpreting complex acoustic signals as
contributory factors. Moreover, perceptual analysis relies heavily on the experience of the assessor, and not all
clinicians have adequate training and exposure to specialized populations. Perceptual judgment remains the
gold standard approach for investigating nasality, and
remains the central tenant in diagnosis and determination of management. However, for outcomes and treatment
progress to be quantified, objective and repeatable measures of change need to be incorporated into every assessment protocol. In light of these features, spectral
analysis has clear benefits as an adjunct to perceptual

This study extends the literature through the comparison of two spectral analysis techniques within the
one cohort of children with hypernasality and healthy
controls. The study is unique in that both high- and lowvowel stimuli were used in varied phonetic environments,
and levels of sensitivity and specificity of one-third octave
analysis were examined. Interestingly, only one technique trialed in this experiment differentiated between
the experimental and control groups (one-third octave
spectra analysis). This is despite the fact that both techniques have been shown previously to be capable of differentiating variance between pathological and control
populations. Nevertheless, few, if any, studies have directly
compared these techniques with one another, nor compared rigorously acquired perceived levels of severity
with the spectral data itself. It is significant to note that
the we not only evaluated the validity of the two common
acoustic techniques but also demonstrated clear distinctions between the spectral profiles of controls and hypernasal children and showed significant variance between
those participants considered to have severe hypernasality and those with normal speech in the present study.
Although this distinction is important, it is of questionable relevance to clinical practice at this time. The perceived success of surgical or therapeutic intervention is
often dependent on subtle changes in levels of hypernasality (i.e., mild vs. moderate vs. severe), which are
often not easily determined by perceptual judgment and
also potentially will not be identified from the acoustic analysis. Furthermore, examination of the sensitivity
and specificity of one-third octave analyses revealed only
mild/moderate overall agreement between formalized
perceptual judgment and the data derived from spectral analysis. In light of the caveats highlighted in
the present article, we suggest that further research
is required into the accessibility and sensitivity of
acoustic techniques before this methodology is used
clinically.
