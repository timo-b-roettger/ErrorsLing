Abstract A digital pursuit rotor was used to monitor oral reading costs by time-locking
tracking performance to the auditory wave form produced as young and older adults were
reading out short paragraphs. Multilevel modeling was used to determine how paragraph-level
predictors of length, grammatical complexity, and readability and person-level predictors
such as speaker age or working memory capacity predicted reading and tracking performance.
In addition, sentence-by-sentence variation in tracking performance was examined during
the production of individual sentences and during the pauses before upcoming sentences. The
results suggest that dual tasking has a greater impact on older adults' reading comprehension
and tracking performance. At the level of individual sentences, young and older adults adopt
different strategies to deal with grammatically complex and propositionally dense sentences.

Introduction
Older adults need to communicate with their families, friends, and neighbors, with their
lawyers and physicians, through face-to-face interaction and over telephones, the internet
and other devices. Successful communication involves reading and listening comprehension
as well as oral and written production. Common challenges to communication include the
declining sensory, cognitive, and physical abilities of older adults (Schneider and Pichora

Fuller 2000) as well as intergenerational differences in communicative goals and discourse
styles (Hummert 2009). Although a variety of age-related impairments to communication
have been documented (Thornton and Light 2006), understanding how aging affects linguistic
processing, hence, how best to enhance older adults' communicative competence, has lagged.
In order to delineate how aging affects linguistic processing, Kemper et al. (2011) compared the performance of young versus older adults on a secondary task while they were
speaking. The participants engaged in a well-practiced perceptual-motor task, pursuit rotor
tracking, while responding orally to probe questions about their likes and dislikes. Their tracking performance was time-locked to their speech so that utterance-by-utterance variation in
tracking performance could be assessed. When young and older adults were simultaneously
talking and tracking a moving target, their tracking performance declined during the pauses
before utterances containing many words or propositions or utterances that were propositionally dense, suggesting that planning long or propositionally dense utterances is costly,
but equally so, for both young and older adults. Tracking performance also declined during
the production of utterances containing many words or propositions, those that were propositionally dense, and those that were grammatically complex, and these production costs were
greater for older adults. Tracking performance also declined during the pauses after utterances containing many words or propositions and those produced rapidly, suggesting that
speakers must recover during the next pause after producing a difficult utterance. Further,
these output costs were greater for older adults than for young adults. Thus, while speech
planning appears to be no more costly for older adults than for young, producing and recovering from long, informative, and complex utterances is more costly for older adults than for
young adults.
Although the costs of speech production and recovery appear to be greater for older
adults than for young adults, both groups used a similar speech style when simultaneously
engaged in pursuit rotor tracking. Both young and older adults tended to use slow, short,
simple sentences although young adults in general use a faster, more complex speech style
than older adults (Kemper 2006). Hence, one limitation of the Kemper et al. (2011) study
is that neither young nor older adults spontaneously produced many grammatically complex
or propositionally dense sentences when engaged simultaneously in pursuit rotor tracking.
To further probe for age group differences in linguistic processing, the present experiment
examined oral reading of paragraphs and sentences while the participants were also engaged
in pursuit rotor tracking.
Ferreira (1991), following Selkirk (1986) and Levelt (1989), suggested that linguistic
analysis is required for the oral repetition of sentences since the phonological form of a
sentence is specified by its linguistic structure. Ferreira (1991) states "For any sentence to
be spoken, it must be translated into a representation that can control the speech apparatus....The more syntactic nodes that must be translated, the longer the translation takes and
so, the longer the initiation or pause time...". (p. 227). Following this assumption, reading
sentences aloud should tap the same linguistic processes and cognitive resources used during
spontaneous speech. In the present experiment, young and older adults were asked to read
aloud paragraphs and sentences varying in grammatical complexity as well as on other linguistic dimensions. If Ferreira's assumption is correct, oral reading should, like spontaneous
speaking, affect concurrent pursuit rotor tracking. However, unlike spontaneous speaking,
this approach provides a way to experimentally manipulate the grammatical complexity or
other psycholinguistic properties of the paragraphs or sentences that are read aloud.
In this experiment, young and older adults were trained on pursuit rotor tracking and then
asked to track a moving target while simultaneously reading aloud. The continuous recording
of tracking was time-locked to the digital recording of the oral reading. This approach permits

two levels of analysis: at the first, or paragraph, level, reading comprehension, reading rate,
and tracking performance as the paragraphs were read aloud compared to baseline conditions
in which the participants read paragraphs aloud while ignoring a moving target or tracked
the moving target while ignoring a paragraph; in addition, at a second, or sentence, level of
analysis, individual sentences were examined by segmenting the continuous record tracking
at the onset and offset of each sentence. At this level of analysis, we could examine tracking
performance as individual sentences were read aloud as well as the duration of the pauses
between sentences and tracking performance during these pauses. At both levels of analysis,
decrements in tracking performance were assumed to reflect the processing costs of individual
paragraphs or sentences.
Not only were we interested in comparing the performance of young versus older adults at
both levels of analysis, we were also interested in investigating how their performance varied
with properties of the individual paragraphs or sentences. Paragraphs were selected from
a variety of sources so that varied in overall length as well as in their overall propositional
density, grammatical complexity, and readability, all properties that have been shown to affect
reading comprehension and reading rate (cf., Stine-Morrow et al. 2008). A variety of measures
of length, complexity, and readability were used as predictors of reading comprehension,
reading rate, and tracking performance to compare how they affected young and older adults.
Individual sentences also varied in grammatical complexity and propositional density and
these measures were used as predictors of tracking performance and pause duration.
Finally, we also investigated how age group and individual differences in cognition affected
reading comprehension and tracking performance. Although vocabulary knowledge increases
over the lifespan (Verhaeghen et al. 2003), most models of cognitive aging assume that working memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control decline (Park et al. 2002). Vocabulary
knowledge (Roland et al. 2007; Stine-Morrow et al. 2008), working memory (Swets et al.
2007), processing speed (Rabaglia and Salthouse 2012; Stine et al. 1986), and inhibitory
control (Connelly et al. 1991; Engelhardt et al. 2010; Hasher and Zacks 1988) have been
shown to affect language processing. These individual and age group changes to cognition
may also affect reading comprehension, reading rate, or tracking performance. A battery of
cognitive tests was administered to the young and older adults and composite scores were
used as predictors of the costs of reading comprehension, reading rate, and paragraph-level
and sentence-level tracking performance to assess these hypotheses.

Method
Participants
Forty young and 40 older adults were tested; technical problems resulted in the loss of
oral reading data for 2 older adults and 3 additional older adults withdrew citing problems
reading the paragraphs on the computer monitor. The young adults were recruited by signs
posted on campus and class announcements while the older adults were recruited from a
database of prospective and previous research participants. The participants were paid for their
participation. Participants were given a battery of tests of cognitive ability, including measures
of working memory, processing speed, inhibition, and vocabulary. Table 1 summarizes the
means, standard deviations, and age group comparisons for each observed measure; an alpha
level of 0.05 was set for these and all subsequent tests.
Vocabulary was assessed by the Shipley (1940) Vocabulary Test, the North American
Reading Test (AmNART; Grober and Sliwinski 1991), and educational attainment in years.

Working memory was assessed by performance on the Digits Forward and Digits Backwards
tests (Wechsler 1958) and the Daneman and Carpenter (1980) Reading Span Test. Processing
speed was assessed using the Digit Symbol Test (Wechsler 1958), the baseline condition of
the Stroop test (Stroop 1935), the Trails A portion of the Trail Making test (Reitan 1958),
and the asymptotic rotor speed attained by the participant following practice (see below).
For working memory, processing speed, and vocabulary, a summary composite was
formed. Factor loadings were obtained from Stata (Stata Corp 2009) using maximum likelihood estimation. Subsequently factor scores were generated for each participant. For each
composite, the respective factor analysis found a single latent factor with moderately-high
to high loadings for each indicator measure. The eigenvalues from the vocabulary, working
memory, and processing speed factor models were, respectively, 1.91, 1.32, and 2.69. Loadings obtained for the vocabulary composite were: Shipley ( = 0.81), AmNART ( = 0.90),
and educational attainment ( = 0.66). Loadings obtained for the working memory composite were: Digits Forward ( = 0.62), Digits Backward ( = 0.73), and Reading Span
( = 0.63). Loadings obtained for the processing speed composite were: Digit Symbol
( = 0.86), Stroop baseline ( = 0.78), Trails A total seconds ( = -0.87), and asymptotic
rotor speed ( = 0.76).
Lastly, the Stroop and Trail Making Tests were also used to derive two measures of
inhibition. A Stroop interference score was then calculated as Stroop Interference = (blocks
of Xs--color names)/blocks of Xs. A Trail Making interference score was calculated as Trail
Making Interference = (seconds Trail A--seconds Trail B)/seconds Trail A. Because only 2

measures of inhibition were available, the Stroop and Trail Making interference scores were
averaged for each participant to create a summary measure.

Task and Design
Twelve paragraphs were selected from a variety of sources including on-line encyclopedia, high school and college textbooks, and newspaper articles so that their overall length
in words and sentences, vocabulary in terms of word frequency, target audience, and
writing style differed. Two additional paragraphs were used during training. The paragraphs were selected to cover a range of general-knowledge topics and writing styles.
All were 10-20 sentences in length. A variety of measures of length, grammatical complexity, and content were assessed using procedures similar to those used by Kemper
et al. (2010, 2011) to analyze oral language samples using Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al.
2004) and CPIDR-3 (Brown et al. 2008). Ten paragraph-level measures of length, grammatical complexity, and readability were obtained; correlations among these measures are
reported in Table 2. Single indicators, rather than latent factor scores, were used as predictors of reading and tracking performance since the paragraphs were chosen to reflect a
range of topics and writing styles rather to systematically explore their underlying factor
structure.
Length: In addition to paragraph length in sentences and words, Mean Length of Utterance
(MLU) in words was obtained automatically from the Coh-Metrix program (Graesser et al.
2004), and the number of propositions in the entire paragraph was obtained from the CPIDR-3
computer program (Brown et al. 2008). Sentences ranged from 9 to 20 (M = 13.6, SD = 3.2);
words ranged from 126 to 299 (M = 242.8, SD = 51.2); MLUs ranged from 12.6 to 22.5
(M = 18.0, SD = 2.5); propositions ranged from 60 to 157 (M = 121.3, SD = 26.2).
The number of words, sentences, and propositions are strongly correlated for this sample, all
r (11) > 0.80, p < .01; average MLU is weakly correlated with the measures of paragraph
length.
Grammatical complexity: Two measures of grammatical complexity were obtained for
each paragraph. Developmental Level (DLevel) was scored based on a scale originally developed by Rosenberg and Abbeduto (1987). Grammatical complexity ranged from simple

one-clause sentences (DLevel = 0) to complex sentences with multiple forms of embedding and subordination (DLevel = 7). Each sentence was scored and the average DLevel
for each paragraph was then calculated. Second, Coh-Metrix provided the Grammatical
Index (GIndex) of each paragraph as a sum of 3 counts per 10 words: the number of
connectives such as "because", "and," or "if", the number of noun phrases, and the number of higher level constituents, such as noun phrase complements and relative clauses.
Higher DLevel and GIndex scores indicate texts are more grammatically complex. DLevels
ranged from 2.4 to 5.4 (M = 3.4, SD = 0.8); GIndex scores ranged from 52.8 to 114.9
(M = 78.1, SD = 18.0). DLevel and GIndex for this small sample correlate r (11) = 0.40,
p < .05.
Readability: Propositional Density (PDensity) was calculated by the CPIDR-3 computer
program (Brown et al. 2008); each sentence was decomposed into its constituent propositions
that represent propositional ideas and the relations between them. PDensity was computed as
the average number of propositions per 100 words. Higher PDensity scores indicate texts that
are more dense. Second, Coh-Metrix provided a measure of coherence, the Coherence Index
(CIndex), as the sum of 2 measures: (1) argument overlap or the proportional of adjacent
sentences that share 1 or more nouns, pronouns, or noun phrases, and (2) LSA cohesion.
LSA cohesion is based on latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al. 1998) which assesses
the conceptual similarity of a text relative to that of other texts; in these analyses, the LSA
cohesion score measured how conceptually similar each sentence was to all other sentences in
the paragraph. Higher CIndex scores indicate more cohesive texts. Similarly is determined by
the overlap of specific words, semantically related words, and words that commonly co-occur
(e.g., "President" and "White House"). Coh-Metrix provided a Type-Token Ratio (TTR) to
measure lexical diversity; lower TTRs indicate that many words are repeated throughout the
paragraph and higher TTRs reflect the use of a greater diversity of words. Finally, Flesch
reading ease (Flesch 1948) was determined by Coh-Metrix; the reading ease scores range
from 0 to 10 with a higher score indicating greater reading ease. It reflects the average
sentence length in words and the average number of syllables per word. (The reading ease
score is often converted to a grade level readability score, ranging from 0 to 12, with lower
numbers indicating greater readability or grade level suitability). PDensity ranged from 45.5
to 59.1 propositions per 100 words (M = 50.0, SD = 3.70); CIndex ranged from 0.9 to
1.7 (M = 1.4, SD = 0.3); TTRs ranged from 0.67 to 0.86 (M = 0.78, SD = 0.29); Flesch
reading ease ranged from 23.7 to 83.9 (M = 44.6, SD = 18.0). Lexical diversity, assessed
by TTR, is correlated negatively with propositional density, semantic coherence, and Flesch
reading ease, all r (11)  .28, p < .05.
In addition to these 10 paragraph-level predictors, there were 2 sentence-level predictors
available: The PDensity (number of propositions/number of words) of each sentence and
the DLevel measure of grammatical complexity of each sentence. Finally, reading rate in
words per min (wpm) was calculated for each paragraph in the baseline reading and dual
task conditions; paragraph reading time was obtained from the synchronized tracking record
which marked the onset and offset of the paragraph reading and converted to reading rate in
words per min. Sentence reading rate in words per min was also calculated for each sentence
in the baseline reading and dual task conditions.
Two 4-alternative choice questions were also prepared for each paragraph. The questions
required inferential answers. To ensure that information obtained from the paragraph was
necessary to answer the questions, a panel of 10 naive judges attempted to the answer the
questions without reading the paragraphs; they correctly choose the right answer only 22 %
of the time. A second panel of 10 judges answered the questions after reading the paragraphs;
they were correct 87 % of the time.

Rotor Training
Participants were initially trained on pursuit rotor tracking following the protocol in Kemper
et al. (2010, 2011). Rotor training was conducted using a stand-alone version of the digital
pursuit rotor developed by the Digital Electronics and Engineering Core of the Biobehavioral
Neurosciences and Communication Disorders Center, a component of the Schiefelbusch
Institute for Life Span Studies at the University of Kansas. The pursuit rotor features a target
that rotates along a circular track. Participants use a trackball mouse to track the target,
attempting to keep a pointer centered on the moving target. Rotor speed can be varied from
approximately 0.2 to 2 revolutions per minute; the program samples the location of the
pointer approximately every 16 ms, and determines its distance (in pixels) from the center of
the target. A moving average of the pointer status (on/off target) is taken over 3 successive
100 ms intervals, and percentage time off target (TOT) is determined. In addition, tracking
error (TE) or the distance in pixels from the center of the target to the pointer is used as
a second measure of tracking performance; it is also averaged over 3 successive 100 ms
intervals.
Participants were trained on the pursuit rotor task to an asymptotic performance level.
Initial tracking speeds for young and older adults were set at 1.2 and 0.45 rev per min,
respectively. Participants practiced tracking for 30 s and received feedback on their performance. A "2 up/1 down stair-case" training procedure was used to gradually increase tracking
speed on successive 30 s trials: if average time off target was 20 % or less for a trial, the speed
was increased by 10 % for the next trial; if time off target was greater than 20 %, the speed was
decreased by 5 %. The stair-case procedure converged on an asymptotic rotor speed when
the rotor speed oscillated around the same value, moving "up" and "down" past this value
3 times. Young adults (M = 16.5, SD = 4.4) required fewer trials to reach an asymptotic
rotor speed than older adults (M = 18.8, SD = 4.9), F(1, 78) = 4.86, p < .05. Asymptotic tracking speed was greater for young adults (M = 1.7 rev/m, SD = 0.3) than for older
adults (M = 1.0 rev/m, SD = 0.3), F(1, 78) = 97.99, p < .01. However, asymptotic TOT
(M = 18.4 %, SD = 3.8) and TE (M = 7.6 pixels, SD = 0.9) were comparable for young
and older adults, both p > .50.

Experimental Procedure
Following rotor training, two experimental tasks were administered; order was counterbalanced across participants. Both were administered using Paradigm (Tagliaferri 2005). In
addition to the paragraph reading task, participants were also tested on a controlled sentence
production task reported separately (Kemper et al. 2010).
To familiarize the participants with the paragraph reading task, 2 practice paragraphs
were presented on the computer screen while they read the paragraphs aloud; following
each paragraph, 2 comprehension questions were presented along with 4 alternatives to
familiarize the participant with the use of trackball to indicate the correct answer. Following
this practice, participants were tested on 3 conditions in a fixed order: First, in the baseline
tracking condition, participants engaged in pursuit rotor tracking while ignoring a paragraph
presented in the center of the circular rotor track. Second, in the baseline paragraph reading
condition, participants read aloud a paragraph presented in the center of the rotor track
while ignoring the moving target. Third, in the dual task condition, participants attempted
to track the moving target while reading aloud a paragraph. Two trials were administered
during each condition; paragraphs were counterbalanced across participants, trials, and the

123

66

J Psycholinguist Res (2014) 43:59-80

experimental conditions such that each participant ignored 2 randomly selected paragraphs
in the baseline tracking condition, read aloud 2 randomly-selected paragraphs in the baseline
reading condition, and read aloud 2 randomly-selected paragraphs while engaged in pursuit
rotor tracking during the dual task condition. Two comprehension questions were presented
immediately after each paragraph in all three (baseline tracking, baseline reading, and dual
task) conditions.
A version of the pursuit rotor was embedded within Paradigm and tracking speed was set
to the asymptotic speed achieved by the participant during training. The paragraphs were
presented centered within the circular rotor track and did not obscure the track, the target, or
the pointer. Each trial involved 3 phases:
1. Warm-up: The rotor track and bull's eye target were displayed and the target began to move
after a 3 s delay and participants tracked it continuously for 20 s while a central fixation
cross was presented. The rotor was reset at the beginning of each trial, repositioning the
target to the "6 o'clock" starting position.
2. Paragraph Presentation: After the 20 s warm-up, the paragraph was presented centered
within the track. It remained visible for 3 min in the baseline tracking condition or until the
participant had finished reading it aloud in the baseline reading and dual task conditions.
3. Questions: Each comprehension question was presented along with 4 alternative choices.
The participant used the trackball to point to the correct answer. The rotor track and target
were not displayed during this phase.
Participants read the paragraphs aloud; their responses were recorded and the audio (WAV)
files were synchronized with their tracking record in the dual task condition. A utility program, the Rotor On-line Speech Segmenter (ROSS), permits these time-locked records to
be segmented into sentences and pauses. The audio file is replayed while a listener inserts
cursors to mark the onset and offset of sentences; play-back speed can be adjusted, the location of the cursors can be manually fine-tuned. The ROSS utility produces a segmented wave
form of sequentially ordered sentences and intra-sentential pauses. The ROSS utility then
extracts measures of tracking performance corresponding to each sentence or pause. These
include: TE, TOT, and variability in TE and TOT during the sentence or pause. The resulting segmented performance record was exported as a spreadsheet which was then annotated
by inserting the sentence-level measures (number of words and propositions and sentence
DLevel).
Using the ROSS utility, two trained coders analyzed 10 % of the paragraph audio files
to assess reliability; the remaining samples were analyzed by a single coder. After practice,
the two coders were able to accurately tag the onset and offset of sentences: the resulting
segment durations were highly correlated, r > 0.99, and average disagreement as to the
onset or offset of sentences was less than 20 ms.

Results
Three sets of analyses are reported. Paragraph-level analyses of reading performance in
the baseline and dual task conditions are presented followed by the analysis of tracking
performance during the baseline and dual task conditions. Following these analyses, sentencelevel analyses of reading rate and tracking performance during the dual task condition are
reported. The final analysis examined the duration of pauses between sentences during the

Paragraph-Level Analyzes
In these analyses, mixed effects regression using restricted maximum likelihood estimation
was used to estimate effects of age group, condition, and their interaction on reading and
tracking performance (Hoffman and Rovine 2007). The 4 person-level measures of working memory, processing speed, vocabulary, and inhibition were also examined as potential
predictors of reading or tracking performance. Composites scores derived from the factor
analysis were used as the predictors of working memory, processing speed, and vocabulary;
the average of the two interference scores was used as the inhibition predictor. In addition, the effects of the 10 paragraph-level measures of length, grammatical complexity, and
content were also examined as potential predictors of reading or tracking performance. All
person-level measures of cognitive ability were group mean-centered prior to the analysis
and the paragraph-level measures of length, grammatical complexity, and content were also
mean-centered prior to the analysis. Unless noted below, young adults and either the reading
or tracking baseline condition were used as the model reference; hence, estimates indicate
the improvement or decline in performance for older adults or for the dual task condition.
The mixed models included only a random intercept for subjects since the selection of 12
paragraphs was highly constrained. All analyses were performed using Stata's XTMixed
procedure; significant parameter estimates (and SEs) are reported. Significance was tested
by obtaining a z-score from ratio of the parameter estimate to its standard error, with an associated 2-tailed p value at  = 0.05. Unless reported below, all other effects and interactions
were not significant.
Reading Performance
Reading performance was assessed by 2 measures: comprehension accuracy assessed as percent correct on the 2 probe questions per paragraph and words per minute (wpm) reading rate.
In the mixed effect models reported below, positive estimates indicate an increase in comprehension accuracy or reading rate, hence improvements in reading performance, whereas
negative estimates indicate a decrease in reading performance.
Comprehension accuracy: Comprehension was assessed by the percentage of questions answered correctly (chance = 25 %) during the baseline tracking condition when
the participants were instructed to ignore the paragraphs, baseline reading condition when
participants were instructed to ignore the moving target, and the dual task condition.
Mixed effects regression was used to estimate effects of age group, condition, and their
interaction as well as the effects of the 4 person-level predictors of processing speed, inhibition, working memory and education and 10 paragraph-level measures of length, grammatical complexity, and content. Both groups were able to perform slightly above chance
(M O = 29 %, SD = 26 %; MY = 37 %, SD = 22 %) in the baseline tracking condition
when they were instructed to ignore the paragraphs while tracking the target. Their comprehension accuracy improved during the baseline reading condition when they were instructed
to read the paragraphs and ignore the moving target (M O = 56 %, SD = 23 %; MY =
55 %, SD = 22 %), resulting in a significant estimate (est.) for the baseline reading condition (est. = 26.9 %, SE = 5.2 %, p < .01). Comprehension accuracy was also higher in
the dual task condition (M O = 49 %, SD = 28 %; MY = 59 %, SD = 24 %) than in the
baseline tracking condition, resulting in a significant estimate for the dual task condition
(est. = 29.4 %, SE = 5.6 %, p < .01). The comprehension of older adults was similar
to that of young adults overall, as indicated by the nonsignificant estimate for age group
(est. = 7.8 %, SE = 5.6 %, p = .162), and older adults' improvement in the baseline

Fig. 1 Improvement in Comprehension Accuracy for Young and Older Adults during the Reading Baseline
and Dual Task Conditions based on Mixed Model Estimates (with 95 % Confidence Intervals) for Age Group,
Condition, and their Interaction

reading condition was comparable to young adults', as indicated by the nonsignificant estimate for the age by baseline reading interaction (est. = -9.0 %, SE = 7.68, p = .240).
However, compared to the young adults, the older adults were less successful in the
dual task condition, resulting in a significant age group by dual task condition estimate
(est. = -17.2 %, SE = 7.7, p = .025). See Fig. 1.
Comprehension accuracy in all 3 conditions was similar for all participants regardless
of individual differences in inhibition, working memory, processing speed, and vocabulary.
Comprehension accuracy1 did vary with the number of words (est. = 0.27, SE = 0.06),
sentences (est. = 1.01, SE = 0.26), propositions (est. = 0.39, SE = 0.08), MLU (est. =
0.62, SE = 0.18), DLevel (est. = -0.36, SE = 0.16), GIndex (est. = -0.04, SE = 0.01),
PDensity (est. = -0.74, SE = .17), Flesch reading ease (est. = 0.33, SE = .13), TTR
(est. = 0.77, SE = .37), and CIndex (est. = -0.95, SE = 0.74), all p < .01. Adding
information (words, sentences, or propositions) improved comprehension as did reducing
DLevel and propositional density, increasing Flesch reading ease, and increasing lexical
diversity. Interestingly, higher GIndex scores and CIndex scores were associated with worse
comprehension; it may be that for these short paragraphs, GIndex and CIndex do not provide
reliable measures of grammatical complexity and semantic cohesion, respectively. The effects
of paragraph length, grammatical complexity, propositional density, and semantic cohesion
were similar in the baseline reading condition and the dual task condition.
Reading Rate
Reading rate in words per min (wpm) was assessed during the baseline reading task
when participants were instructed to ignore the moving target and during the dual task
1 Estimates indicate the increase or decrease in the number of correctly answered questions per each 1 unit

increase in the predictor. For example, the estimate for propositions of 0.39 indicates that adding an additional
proposition will increase comprehension by approximately 0.4 questions and the estimate for PDensity of
-0.74 indicates that increasing PDensity by 1 proposition per 100 words will reduce the number of correctly
answered questions by 0.74.

condition. Mixed effects regression was used to estimate effects of age group, condition,
and their interaction as well as the effects of the 4 person-level predictors of processing speed, inhibition, working memory and education and 10 paragraph-level measures of
length, grammatical complexity, and content. Compared to the baseline reading condition
in which participants ignored the moving target while reading (M O = 131 wpm, SD =
31 wpm; MY = 158 wpm, SD = 21 wpm), reading rates in the dual task condition
(M O = 107wpm, SD = 28wpm; MY = 150 wpm, SD = 27 wpm) were slower (est. =
-7.3 wpm, SE = 3.1 wpm, p < .02); Compared to young adults, older adults read more
slowly (est. = -26.4 wpm, SE = 5.3 wpm, p < .01), especially in the dual task condition
(est. = -17.2 wpm, SE = 4.5 wpm, p < .001).
Reading rates in both conditions were similar for all participants regardless of individual
differences in inhibition, working memory, and vocabulary although those individuals who
were faster on the processing speed measures, relative to their age group mean, also read
more rapidly (est. = 19.9 wpm, SE = 2.8 wpm, p < .01). Reading rate was affected by length
(sentences: est. = 13.7, SE = 6.3; words: est. = -5.1, SE = 1.4; propositions: est. = 7.7, SE =
2.1), by grammatical complexity (DLevel: est. = -9.3, SE = 4.1; GIndex: est. = -0.7, SE =
0.3), and by readability (PDensity: est. = -17.2, SE = 4.3; Flesch: est. = 10.0, SE = 3.2), all
p < .01.2 Reading rate did not vary with MLU, CIndex, or TTR. Reading rates were faster
for paragraphs with more sentences and propositions and for those higher in Flesch reading
ease (e.g., lower in grade level); reading rates were slower for paragraphs with more words,
more complex sentences, and greater propositional density. The effects of paragraph length,
grammatical complexity, propositional density, and semantic cohesion on reading rate were
similar in both the reading baseline condition and the dual task condition.
Reading Summary
Although they read more slowly than young adults, older adults had equally good comprehension of the paragraphs in the baseline reading condition when they were instructed to ignore
the moving target. However, the older adults were unable to match the young adults' comprehension of the paragraphs in the dual task condition, despite a further decline in their reading
rate. Comprehension and reading rate varied with the length, grammatical complexity, and
readability of the paragraphs in both conditions.
Tracking Performance
Tracking performance in the baseline tracking condition in which the participants were
instructed to ignore the paragraphs while tracking the moving target was compared to performance during the dual task condition. Tracking performance was assessed by 4 measures,
TE or tracking error in pixels and TOT or time on target (percent), as well as the variability
of each measure. Separate models were estimated for the two phases: the initial warm-up
phase prior to the onset of the paragraph, and the paragraph presentation phase, examining
the effects of age group, condition, and their interaction as well as the 4 person-level predictors of processing speed, inhibition, working memory, and education. The effects of the 10
paragraph-level predictors of length, grammatical complexity, and content were examined
2 Estimates indicate the increase or decrease in reading rate per each 1 unit increase in the predictor. For

example, the estimate for length in sentences of 13.7 indicates that adding an additional sentence will increase
reading rate by approximate 14 wpm and the estimate for PDensity of -17.2 indicates that increasing PDensity
by 1 proposition per 100 words will reduce reading rate approximately 17 wpm.

Means and SD (in parenthesis) for Tracking Error (TE) and Time on Task (TOT) are reported

in the models of the paragraph presentation phase only. Tracking performance by young and
older adults during the warm-up and paragraph presentation phases is summarized in Table 3.
Warm-up Phase: Tracking performance during the warm-up phase was somewhat less
accurate and more variable in the baseline tracking condition when the participants ignored
the paragraphs than in the dual task condition as indicated by significant estimates for condition for TE (est. = -3.9, SE = 1.9) TE SD (est. = -4.4, SE = 1.5), and TOT SD (est. =
-1.9, SE = 0.8), all p < .05. But this effect of condition was similar for both young and older
adults with the exception TE SD (condition by age group est. = 4.34, SE = 2.2, p < .05).
Overall, older adults during the warm-up phase were somewhat worse at tracking than young
adults, as indicated by significant age group estimates for TE (est. = 8.4, SE = 2.4) and TOT
(est. = -7.0, SE = 1.9), both p < .01.
Individuals who were faster, relative to their age group mean, on the processing speed
measures had an overall advantage for tracking during either condition as indicated by significant estimates for TE (est. = -3.5, SE = 0.6), TE SD (est. = 3.0, SE = 0.4), TOT (est. =
6.2, SE = 1.1) and TOT SD (est. = -1.3, SE = 0.3), all p < .01. Those with better working
memory were also somewhat better at tracking (TE est. = -2.70, SE = 1.2; TE SD est. =
-2.59, SE = 0.95, TOT SD est. = -1.48, SE = 0.63), all p < .05. Individual differences in
inhibition and vocabulary did not affect tracking performance in either condition. Tracking
performance was similar for all paragraphs regardless of their differences in length, grammatical complexity, and readability with 3 exceptions: TOT variability was slightly reduced
when the participants were reading longer paragraphs in words (est. = -0.6, SE = 0.3) and
TOT variability slightly increased when the paragraphs contained more propositions (est. =
0.9, SE = 0.4) and for paragraphs higher in Flesch reading ease (est. = 1.3, SE = 0.6), all
p < .01; these effects on TOT variability were similar for both the baseline tracking condition
and the dual task condition.
Paragraph Presentation Phase: Table 4 summarizes the results for the mixed effects analysis
of tracking performance examining effects for age group, condition, and their interaction.
Tracking performance during the dual task condition was compared to tracking performance
during the tracking baseline condition when the participants were instructed to ignore the
paragraphs. Tracking was less accurate and more variable during the dual task condition than
during the baseline condition as indicated by the significant estimates for condition for TE,
TE SD, TOT, and TOT SD. Older adults' tracking was worse than young adults' tracking, as
indicated by the significant estimates for age group for TE SD, TOT, and TOT SD. The impact
of paragraph reading on tracking performance was greater for older adults than for young
adults, as indicated by significant estimates for the condition by age group interactions.

Individuals who were faster, relative to their age group mean, on the processing speed
measures, had an overall advantage for tracking during either condition as indicated by significant estimates for TE (est. = -3.5, SE = 0.6), TE SD (est. = 3.0, SE = 0.4), TOT (est. =
6.2, SE = 1.1) and TOT SD (est. = -1.3, SE = 0.3), all p < .01. Individual differences in
inhibition, working memory, and vocabulary did not affect tracking performance in either
condition. Tracking performance was similar for all paragraphs regardless of their differences in length, grammatical complexity, and readability with 3 exceptions: TOT variability
was slightly reduced when the participants were reading longer paragraphs in words (est. =
-0.6, SE = 0.3) and TOT variability slightly increased when the paragraphs contained more
propositions (est. = 0.9, SE = 0.4) and for paragraphs higher in Flesch reading ease (est. =
1.3, SE = 0.6), all p < .01; these effects on TOT variability were similar for both the baseline
tracking condition and the dual task condition and for young versus older adults.
Tracking Summary
Older adults could not match the tracking performance of young adults in either the warm-up
or paragraph presentation phases and the impact of reading on tracking was greater for older
adults than for young adults. However, tracking performance did not, in general, vary with
the length, grammatical complexity, or content of the paragraphs.
Sentence-Level Analyses
In these analyses, crossed random effects regression using restricted maximum likelihood
estimation was used to estimate fixed effects of age group on reading and tracking performance for individual sentences nested within paragraphs during the dual task condition. The
4 person-level measures of working memory, processing speed, vocabulary, and inhibition
were then examined as potential predictors of individual reading or tracking performance.
Sentence-level measures of propositional density and grammatical complexity were also
examined as potential predictors of reading or tracking performance. All person-level measures of cognitive ability were group mean-centered prior to the analysis and the sentencelevel measures were also mean-centered prior to the analysis. Young adults were used as
the model reference; hence, estimates indicate the improvement or decline in performance
for older adults. All analyses were performed using Stata's XTMixed procedure; significant
parameter estimates (and SEs) are reported. Significance was tested by obtaining a z-score
from ratio of the parameter estimate to its standard error, with an associated 2-tailed p value
at  = 0.05. Unless reported below, all other effects and interactions were not significant.

Reading Rate
Reading rate at the level of individual sentences during the dual task condition was analyzed
with mixed effects regression to examine the effects of age group, the 4 person-level predictors
of processing speed, inhibition, working memory, and education, and the 2 sentence-level
predictors of DLevel and PDensity. Overall, young adults read aloud more rapidly than older
adults (M O = 123 wpm, SD = 45 wpm; MY = 169 wpm, SD = 53 wpm), as indicated
by the significant estimate for age group (est. = -55.2, SE = 10.7, p < .001). Individuals
who were faster, relative to their age group mean, on the processing speed measures, had an
overall advantage for tracking during either condition as indicated by a significant estimate for
sentence reading rates (est. = 24.6, SE = 3.6, p < .001). Individual differences in inhibition,
working memory, and education did not affect oral reading rates at the level of individual
sentences.
Sentence reading rate was also affected by the propositional density of the individual
sentences (est. = -77.7, SE = 15.8, p < .001). Although the overall effect of DLevel was
not significant, PDensity did interact with DLevel (est. = 8.4, SE = 3.4, p = .015) but
this interaction was similar for young and older adults. Figure 2 illustrates this interaction.
Sentence reading rate declined with the propositional density of individual sentences; this
effect was greatest for simple 1-clause sentences at DLevel = 0 and gradually dissipated as
DLevel increased, so that sentence reading rates for very complex sentences at DLevel = 7
were unaffected by propositional density. This pattern suggests that young and older adults'
oral reading rates vary with the difficulty of extracting propositional information, as long as
the sentences are grammatically easy to parse.
Tracking Performance
Tracking performance at the level of individual sentences during the dual task condition
was assessed by 4 measures, TE or tracking error in pixels and TOT or time on target
(percent), as well as the variability of each measure. For each measure of tracking performance
crossed random effects regression was used to examine the effects of age group, the 4 personlevel predictors of processing speed, inhibition, working memory, and education, and the 2
sentence-level predictors of DLevel and PDensity. Table 5 summarizes the results. At the
sentence level, older adults' tracking was worse than young adults' tracking, as indicated by
the significant estimate for age group for TOT (est. = -14.6, SE = 6.2, p = .018). Faster
individuals had an overall advantage for tracking during either condition as indicated by
significant estimates for TE (est. = -5.6, SE = 0.9), TE SD (est. = -2.9, SE = 0.4), and TOT
(est. = 10.3, SE = 1.8), all p < .01. Individual differences in inhibition, working memory,
and education did not affect tracking performance at the level of individual sentences.
TOT tracking performance was also affected by the DLevel of individual sentences (est. =
1.9, SE = 1.0, p = .049) and this effect of DLevel was different for older versus young
adults, as indicated by the age group by DLevel interaction (est. = -3.0, SE = 1.4, p = .035).
Although the overall effect of PDensity was not significant, PDensity did interact with DLevel
(est. = 5.6, SE = 2.9, p = .048) and this interaction varied with age group as indicated by
the significant estimate for the age group by DLevel by PDensity interaction (est. = -3.8,
SE = 2.0, p = .052). Figure 3 illustrates this interaction. For young adults, as DLevel
increased, the effect of PDensity also increased such that propositional density had no effect
on TOT for simple sentences at DLevels  2 but TOT declined with propositional density for
complex sentences at DLevels > 2. However, a different pattern is evident for older adults:
propositional density had little effect on tracking performance regardless of sentence DLevel.

Sentence-level Summary
Reading rate and tracking performance for individual sentences varied with their grammatical complexity and propositional density. For both young and older adults, reading rate
declined as propositional density increased, with the magnitude of the decline lessening with
increasing grammatical complexity. Young adults could maintain good tracking accuracy
when the sentences were simple and propositional density was low but their tracking accuracy declined with propositional density when the sentences were grammatically complex.
On the other hand, older adults' tracking performance was poor and did not vary with either
the propositional density or grammatical complexity of the sentences they were reading.
Individual Pauses
Readers pause between sentences when reading aloud and these pauses may reflect the costs
of either planning the production of upcoming sentences or recovery from the production of
preceding sentences. The duration of the pauses between sentences was analyzed with crossed
random effects regression to examine the effects of age group, the 4 person-level predictors of
processing speed, inhibition, working memory, and education, and the 2 sentence-level predictors of DLevel and PDensity, on one hand looking forward to the production of upcoming
sentences, on the other looking backward at recovery from preceding sentences.
Overall, young adults' pauses were shorter than older adults' pauses (M O = .94 s, SD =
1.17; MY = .50 s, SD = 0.40), as indicated by the significant estimate for age group (est. =
0.4, SE = 0.1, p = .005). And faster participants paused more briefly between sentences
than slower participants, resulting in a significant estimate for processing speed (est. = -0.2,
SE = 0.1, p < .001).
Pause duration was also affected by planning the production of upcoming sentences such
that both the DLevel (est. = 0.38, SE = 0.14, p = .001) and PDensity (est. = 0.38, SE = 0.14,
p = .045) of upcoming sentences contributed to pause duration. For both groups, pause
duration increased with propositional density, and with DLevel. These effects of sentence
grammatical complexity and propositional density were greater for older adults, as indicated
by the age group by DLevel interaction (est. = 0.2, SE = 0.1, p = .015) and the age group
by PDensity interaction (est. = 1.0, SE= 0.5, p = .038). See Fig. 4. Recovery costs were
negligible as pause duration was not affected by either the DLevel or PDensity of preceding
sentences.
To investigate whether tracking performance during pauses also reflected planning or producing sentences, four measures of tracking performance were examined: TE or tracking
error in pixels and TOT or time on target (percent), as well as the variability of each measure.

For each measure of tracking performance during the pauses, crossed random effects regression was used to examine the effects of age group, the 4 person-level predictors of processing
speed, inhibition, working memory, and education, and the 2 sentence-level predictors of
DLevel and PDensity.

However, TE and TOT, and their SDs, were not sensitive to the costs of planning or producing
sentences varying in DLevel or PDensity, perhaps because the pauses were so short for these
measures to be reliably calculated.

Pause Summary
Although tracking performance during pauses did not vary, pause duration varied with
the grammatical complexity and propositional density of upcoming sentences. Readers,

Discussion
A variety of experimental paradigms have been used to investigate how aging affects the
processing of individual words, sentences, or paragraphs (Stine-Morrow et al. 2008). These
paradigms typically rely on the analysis of time-comparing response times of young versus
older adults to different psycholinguistic manipulations or in different experimental conditions. Pre-existing age group differences in the speed of processing, response time distributions, and intraindividual variability complicate the interpretation of age by condition
interactions (Faust et al. 1999; Myerson et al. 2003; Ratcliff et al. 2000). Other paradigms
manipulate the linguistic input by adding noise or through time-compression (Stine et al.
1986; Tun 1998) but they are also subject to criticism since the manipulations may differentially impact aging sensory systems, inducing ad hoc accommodations and processing
strategies (Schneider et al. 2005). The current approach combines oral reading with pursuit
rotor tracking to investigate age differences in linguistic processing.
Combining oral reading with pursuit rotor tracking provides 2 ways of looking at how
aging affects linguistic processing. First, by looking at reading and tracking performance at
the paragraph level, we see that older adults cannot match the performance of young adults,
showing deficits of reading rate, reading comprehension, and tracking due to the demands of
simultaneously reading and tracking the moving target. Regardless of condition, comprehension accuracy and reading rates improved when the paragraphs were longer, grammatically
simpler, and more readable, suggesting that providing more information and increasing the
ease at which that information can be processed benefits readers regardless of whether their
attention is divided between reading and a secondary task or not. However, at this level of
analysis, tracking performance, in general, did not vary with the overall length, grammatical
complexity, or readability of the paragraphs, indicating that readers were able to maintain a
consistent level of tracking performance even when they were reading long paragraphs filled
with complex, propositionally dense sentences.
At this point we might conclude that aging results in a general deficit, affecting reading
rate, reading comprehension, and dual task performance. We might also conclude that oral
reading is sensitive to some aspects of language processing since reading rate does vary with
psycholinguistic properties of the paragraphs such as grammatical complexity and propositional density. And we might conclude that combining pursuit rotor tracking with oral reading
does not provide critical new insights into aging and linguistic processing.
When we examine performance at the level of individual sentences, a different picture
emerges. We observe that both young and older adults modulated their oral reading rate
with the ease of processing the sentences, slowing down as sentence propositional density
increased. This modulation of reading rate gradually dissipated as the sentences became
increasing complex grammatically, suggesting that just slowing down was no longer sufficient
to overcome the processing demands imposed by the need to analyze complex syntactic
structures while also unpacking a lot of propositional information.
This level of analysis also allows us to look at the pauses before upcoming sentences as a
reflection of speech planning costs. When we do, we see that readers strategically lengthen
their pauses before they read aloud difficult sentences, taking extra time to plan out how to
articulate these sentences. The pattern suggests that readers were attempting to "buy time"
for tracking while they were planning how to articulate demanding sentences. This finding

contrasts with the reports by Kemper et al. (2010) using a controlled production task; after
producing a long or grammatically complex sentence, speakers required more time to recover
than after producing a shorter or simpler sentence and that these recovery costs were greater
for older than young adults. Our results are, however, consistent with studies of the eyevoice span (Levin and Buckler-Addis 1979) which suggested that grammatical complexity
affects how far ahead readers look when reading aloud. Kemper et al. (2011) reported that
tracking performance during spontaneous production varied with the difficulty of preceding
utterances and these recovery costs were also greater for older than young adults. We did not
find that tracking performance during pauses varied with the difficulty of either upcoming or
preceding sentences; perhaps because pause durations were so short, averaging less than 1 s,
that our tracking measures, aggregated over 3 successive 100 ms segments, were insensitive
to either planning or recovery costs.
It is at this sentence-level of analysis that we see marked differences in how young and
older adults respond to the dual task demands. We see that young adults' tracking performance
declined with the propositional density of the sentences, especially when the sentences were
also grammatically complex. Hence, just reading more slowly was not sufficient to enable the
young adults to fully process propositionally dense and grammatically complex sentences;
they also shifted attention away from the demands of pursuit rotor tracking in order to
do so. However, older adults' tracking performance did not vary with sentence difficulty.
Older adults attempted to `buy time' by reading more slowly as the sentences increased
in difficulty and by paused longer before grammatically complex and propositional dense
sentences. However, controlling the temporal dynamics of reading was not sufficient as the
older adults' were unable to maintain their baseline level of tracking just by reading more
slowly and pausing longer.
Prior research combining pursuit rotor tracking with spontaneous speech (Kemper et al.
2010) suggested that planning long, complex sentences was equally costly for young and
older adults but production costs were greater for older adults. However, both young and
older adults could choose their words and sentences, and both groups tended to use slow,
short, simple sentences. In this study, young and older adults were forced to read aloud
sentences varying in length, grammatical complexity, and readability. Both young and older
adults experienced difficulty as they struggled to engage in pursuit tracking while reading
aloud sentences. Greater planning costs for older adults emerged as they prepared to read
aloud propositionally dense and grammatically complex sentences, ones that they are unlikely
to produce spontaneously. Indeed, these planning costs for older adults were so severe that
their tracking performance dropped from a baseline level of 83 % time on target to only 43 %
time on target, even for simple sentences.
Prior studies of spontaneous speech suggested that older adults adopt a simplified speech
style (Kemper 2006; Kemper et al. 2010), one characterized by the use of short and grammatically simple sentences. However, a variety of pragmatic and stylistic preferences may
contribute to older adults' use of this simplified style. This approach of combining oral reading with pursuit rotor tracking has confirmed prior findings that aging affects the ability to
plan grammatically complex and propositionally dense sentences. Even when older adults
need only read aloud long, complexity, and propositionally dense sentences, they struggle to
do so, speaking slowly and pausing longer between sentences. Although working memory
capacity limitations have been implicated in prior studies of the effects of aging on linguistic
processing (Kemper 2006), the present results suggest that individual differences in inhibition, working memory, and education do not affect dual task costs. Faster individuals do have
an advantage but only in that they read more rapidly and pause more briefly between sentences. Thus, by examining dual task costs of reading aloud individual sentences, this study

suggests that aging leads to a general loss of the ability to plan grammatically complex and
propositionally dense sentences. Older adults rarely spontaneously produce such sentences
and when forced to read them aloud, they are unable to simultaneously perform a simple
visual-motor tracking task.
