ABSTRACT
This study investigated the narrative production skills of early-adolescent, Spanish-speaking language
minority (LM) learners (n = 43) and their English-only (EO) peers (n = 38). The sample was born
in the United States, educated in English, and representative of low- and high-income backgrounds.
Using a picture book as a prompt, students' narratives were transcribed, coded, and compared on
macrostructure skills (story structure), microstructure skills (discrete language skills: vocabulary and
grammar), and use of mazes (disruptions in speech). Results demonstrated that the groups did not
differ on story structure. However, LM learners produced lengthier narratives than their EO peers,
ones that resulted in stories that were less grammatically diverse and included more grammatical
revisions and errors in prepositions. Thus, by early adolescence, EO and LM learners in urban schools
may have well-developed macrostructure skills, yet the LM learners may still be developing specific
microstructure skills.

A growing population of students in US classrooms comprises children from
homes where English is not the primary language (Fry & Lopez, 2012; National
Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition, 2011). The largest and fastest
growing group of school-age learners is US-born children of immigrants, who are
educated in the United States (Capps et al., 2005) and who are faced with simultaneously learning English and the academic curriculum. Research focused on this

population suggests that even after many years of schooling in English, language
minority (LM) learners tend to demonstrate, on average, underdeveloped literacyrelated skills in comparison to their English-only (EO) peers (August & Shanahan,
2006; Jean & Geva, 2009; Lesaux & Kieffer, 2010; Mancilla-Martinez & Lesaux,
2010). In particular, for those LM learners from Spanish-speaking homes, which
is the largest group of LM learners in the United States, much research suggests
that their discrete English language skills, for example, vocabulary skills, lag
behind their native English-speaking peers (for relevant reviews, see August &
Shanahan, 2006; Genesee, Lindholm-Leery, Saunders, & Christian, 2006) and do
not necessarily "catch up" with time (Kieffer, 2008; Mancilla-Martinez & Lesaux,
2011).
It is important to recognize, however, that the great majority of existing research
to describe LM learners' (low) language skills employs standardized assessments,
most often using a forced-choice format and generating a proxy for one specific
aspect of language, such as vocabulary. Although certainly important for gauging general performance, this assessment strategy limits our understanding of the
specific skills that underlie students' results. To better support and promote this
growing population's academic development, we need to understand more deeply
their language development: how they are using language and what aspects of
language are challenging, moving past accounts of "low" language, globally. In
sum, drawing on Garcia-Coll et al.'s (1996) model of studying minority children's
development, researchers must attend to sources of strength, in addition to weaknesses, and in turn uncover unique aspects of development, including those in the
domain of language.
Given the multifaceted nature of language, a study of LM learners' oral narratives has the particular advantage of providing insight into multiple levels of
language skill. That is, the oral narrative not only affords the opportunity for assessment of LM learners' skill in organizing a story (often referred to as macrostructural components) but also provides insight into their discrete language skills (often referred to as microstructure components) as well as the speech planning and
production processes involved in telling a story aloud. Moreover, because oral narratives involve the type of language valued in the US school system, for instance,
decontextualized talk (Dickinson & Tabors, 1991) that is lexically and grammatically complex (Davidson, Kline, & Snow, 1986), narrative competence may
be indicative of academic competency (Dickinson & McCabe, 2001). Yet, while
there is an extensive literature focused on narrative skills in monolingual children
(Berman & Slobin 1994; Peterson & McCabe, 1983), less is known about narrative skills in LM learners, and much less during adolescence, because there have
been too few studies focused on this population (Fiestas & Pena, 2004; GutierrezClellen, 2002; Pearson, 2002; Uccelli & Paez, 2007). Thus, the present study was
designed to advance the theoretical and empirical literature focused on Spanishspeaking LM learners' narratives, in this case with a sample of early adolescents.
STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF ORAL NARRATIVES

There is an extensive literature base on the structural characteristics of stories
(e.g., Berman & Slobin, 1994; Labov & Waletzky, 1967; McCabe & Peterson,

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

935

1991; Stromqvist & Verhoeven, 2004). There is also widespread agreement on the
minimum characteristics of a well-formed story, including reference to a protagonist and his/her desires or goals, goal-directed (and/or nongoal-directed) actions,
and outcomes related to those goals (Mandler & Johnson, 1977; Stein & Glenn,
1979; Stein & Policastro, 1984). In other words, a "good" fictional story has been
understood in the developmental literature as a goal-action-outcome framework,
one in which there is a problem-initiating event for which the protagonist forms a
goal and carries out actions to achieve that goal. According to Labov and Waletzky
(1967), in addition to accomplishing a referential function (i.e., explaining who
or what the story is about), a narrative also accomplishes an evaluative function
(i.e., why the story is told) in that the narrator makes statements about attitudes
concerning the people, settings, things, or events in the story.
Developmental analyses of oral narratives, primarily focused on monolingual
children of varying ages, have shown a developmental progression in story structure (for a review, see Hudson & Shapiro, 1991). Specifically, while monolingual
preschool children tend to construct narratives that lack many of the basic elements
of a story (e.g., Applebee, 1978), the elementary school years represent a critical
time for the development of story structure (Stein, 1988; Stein & Glenn, 1982).
For example, it has been shown that by fifth grade, monolingual children construct
coherent and goal-based fictional narratives (Hudson & Shapiro, 1991).
The few but growing number of narrative studies conducted with LM learners
suggests that narrative development in LM learners follows a trajectory similar to
EO children's. For example, a longitudinal study of Spanish-speaking LM learners' story structure development (Melzi, Schick, & Bostwick, 2013) showed that
by 5 years of age, children gained skills aimed at increasing narrative complexity by, for example, consistently including initiating events, actions, and plans.
At the same time, the children relied heavily on pronouns or descriptors and
demonstrated emerging skills in domains such as mentioning specific settings. In
a cross-sectional study of second- and fifth-grade Spanish-speaking LM learners'
narratives, Pearson (2002) also found that there was a general increase in inclusion
of story structure components with age. By fifth grade, there were no differences
between LM learners and their monolingual English peers with respect to the
complexity of narrative structure. In sum, as LM children mature, there are minimal differences in the structural characteristics of their stories in comparison to
monolinguals'.
Research on narrative production in LM learners has also revealed crosslinguistic influences of story structure. In Pearson's (2002) study, there was a
high correlation between story structure scores in Spanish and English, indicating
a positive contribution of the native language. Fiestas and Pena (2004) also found
evidence that narrative skills are interrelated as early as 4 years of age. It is worth
noting that although they found differences in Spanish-speaking LM learners'
reliance on particular narrative structure components depending on the language
used to tell the stories (e.g., more initiating events in Spanish and consequences
in English), the complexity of the narrative structure was no different between the
languages. In addition, Uccelli and Paez (2007) and Squires et al. (2014) showed
that Spanish narrative skills in kindergarten predicted first-grade English narrative
skills. These findings suggest that story structure might transcend language; that

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4

936

is, LM learners may be able to transfer their knowledge about story elements from
one language to the other (Pearson, 2002).

THE DISCRETE LANGUAGE FEATURE OF ORAL NARRATIVES

As noted, producing a well-formed story involves paying attention not only to
narrative structure but also to multiple aspects of linguistic structure, such as lexical and grammatical encoding of information relating to characters and events
(Berman & Slobin, 1994). Berman and Slobin (1994) argue for the interrelatedness and interactive development of linguistic structures and storytelling. They
emphasize that to produce complex narratives, one must move beyond basic
syntax and produce complex sentences, for example, by incorporating subordinate clauses. Using growth-modeling techniques, a recent longitudinal study
on young Spanish-speaking LM learners' narratives (Rojas & Iglesias, 2013) revealed that their grammatical complexity continued to increase during the early
school years, as has been established for monolingual speakers (Chomsky, 1969;
Karmiloff-Smith, 1979; Loban, 1976). In particular, LM learners with weaker
initial English proficiency experienced faster growth rates in English than their
LM counterparts with more advanced initial English proficiency; the differences
in complexity between the two groups was less pronounced over time. Moreover,
in Pearson's (2002) study, differences in grammatical complexity (e.g., use of subordination) between LM learners and their monolingual peers dissipated by fifth
grade.
While the narratives of older EO and LM learners may not differ in terms of
grammatical complexity, LM learners' grammatical skills in English may differ
from their EO counterparts', in particular, on structures that are inherently different between English and Spanish (Gathercole, 2002a, 2002b, 2002c). As a case
in point, preposition use in English can pose particular challenges for Spanish
speakers given the lack of one-to-one correspondence of prepositions between
the two languages (see Becker & Carroll, 1997; Coventry, Guijarro-Fuentes, &
Valdes, 2012). For example, the spatial relationships represented by the prepositions in, on, and at in English are all encompassed by the Spanish preposition en.
That is, while the English language distinguishes between spatial relationships,
such as containment and support, with the use of different prepositions (in vs. on,
respectively), Spanish collapses these relationships within a single term en.
There is also some evidence that in comparison to their English monolingual
peers, children who are exposed to more than one language show lower performance on standardized assessments of English vocabulary, which is another
critical component skill of constructing a narrative (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, & Yang,
2010; Hoff et al., 2012; Place & Hoff, 2011). It is worth noting, however, that
English vocabulary performance is linked to the amount of exposure to and use
of English (De Houwer, 2007; Pearson, 2002; Pearson, Fernandez, Lewedeg, &
Oller, 1997). Moreover, socioeconomic status (SES) strongly predicts oral language skills, including vocabulary size (Hart & Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003) and
grammatical complexity (Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea, & Hedges,
2010; Vasilyeva, Waterfall, & Huttenlocher, 2008).

937

It is critical that the population of school-age LM learners in the United States
represents a confounding of these two predictive factors (amount of English exposure and low SES) because approximately 25% is Latino (Fry & Lopez, 2012),
with 70% speaking Spanish at home (Ryan, 2013) and 39% living in poverty
(Lopez & Velasco, 2011). As one example, a longitudinal study (prekindergarten
through age 12) conducted with a sample of 183 Spanish-speaking LM children,
from low-income backgrounds, revealed that children's English oral language
skills started out well below the national average, as determined by standardized, norm-referenced assessments. However, despite being educated in English,
and their rates of growth were faster than those of the English monolinguals,
they were not fast enough to allow them to catch up by age 12. That is, at age
12, their English vocabulary skills were a full standard deviation below national
norms, whereas their English word reading skills were on par with national norms
(Mancilla-Martinez & Lesaux, 2011). Kieffer (2008) confirmed such trends using a nationally representative sample of learners who entered US schools with
limited English proficiency, after controlling for school poverty and demographic
risk factors, including SES. Given the dearth of studies focused on the older LM
learner, it is unclear whether this is a process that may be characterized as a deficit
or a developmental lag. Studies with LM learners well past the primary grades will
begin to shed light on these outstanding questions about language development.
THE SPEECH PLANNING AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES INVOLVED
IN TELLING ORAL NARRATIVES

Beyond a focus on the macro- and microstructures (story structure and linguistic
forms, respectively) that cut across common narrative genres (e.g., scripts, personal
narratives, and stories; see Hudson & Shapiro, 1991), a critical component of
oral storytelling is the planning and production of speech. In one of the most
influential theoretical models of oral production, Levelt (1989; for the adapted
bilingual version, see de Bot, 2004) emphasizes that in preparation for articulating
speech, a speaker conceptualizes an idea, and then translates these conceptual
representations into linguistic forms, for example, by selecting the individual
words the narrator wants to say (lexical/vocabulary planning) and combining them
to form sentences (grammatical planning). Levelt, Roelofs, and Meyer (1999)
further theorize that self-monitoring is evident at every stage in the process. Thus,
it is at any point during the planning and execution of the speech plan that a
speaker may become uncertain or encounter difficulty, for instance, in retrieving
a word or constructing the syntax of an utterance. If a mistake occurs and/or the
speaker decides to modify the message, the fluidity of language production is
compromised. The resulting speech disruptions are what Loban (1976) referred
to as "mazes," which he defined as being unnecessary for the intended message;
material outside of mazes represents a meaningful communication unit (Bedore,
Fiestas, Pena, & Nagy, 2006). Mazes include filled pauses like "uh" and "um," and
repetitions, and revisions made to any part of a word or utterance (MacLachlan &
Chapman, 1988; Wiese, 1984).
There is conflicting evidence regarding developmental change, with some early
studies finding stability in maze use across age (Loban, 1976) and others finding a

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

938

greater frequency of mazes with increased age (Evans, 1985). More recent research
has provided further insight and suggests that maze frequency increases with age
and the complexity of the context; for example, there is evidence of increased use of
mazes during narration in comparison to conversation (Leadholm & Miller, 1992).
In general, then, it appears that revisions require advanced linguistic knowledge
and having low language skill makes it difficult to recognize when revisions are
needed (Kormos, 1999). Thus, in the context of a complex narrative, it is expected
that adolescents will engage in revisions, but it remains unknown how LM learners,
who have been shown to have low language skills on more global measures of
language, compare to their EO peers. A recent study with young LM learners
(Bedore et al., 2006) shows that maze use was positively associated with measures
of productivity, for example, mean length of utterance (MLU), which is often
used as a proxy for grammatical complexity. However, in that study, there was no
difference in the number of mazes exhibited compared to young monolinguals,
whereas previous research has shown differences between adult monolinguals and
speakers of two languages, with the latter group producing more mazes (Lennon,
1990; Wiese, 1984).
PRESENT STUDY

In light of existing research and outstanding questions, the purpose of the present
study was to investigate the narrative production skills of early adolescent LM
learners and their EO peers. We take a comprehensive approach to studying
narratives in an attempt to uncover the unique strengths of, not only weaknesses
in, adolescent LM learners' language skills. Guided by the existing literature on
young children's narrative development, we examined the narrative production
skills of older EO and LM learners with a focus on the structural organization of
their stories (macrostructural characteristics) and their linguistic form and content
(microstructural characteristics), as well as the planning and production processes
involved in producing speech (mazes). To elicit the spontaneous narrative, we
used a wordless picture book; this is a particularly useful strategy with older
learners because the pictures limit the scope of the plot and general content of the
narratives children produce (Berman & Slobin, 1994; Petersen, Gillam, & Gillam,
2008), but still allow for a range of variability in story and language elements
(Heilmann et al., 2008). Although the great majority of research on narratives has
used the Frog, Where Are You? book series (Mayer, 1969) to elicit narratives from
young students, it has a rather juvenile format and plot. Given our early adolescent
sample and our goal of ensuring high interest in producing high-quality narratives,
we used the graphic, wordless novel Robot Dreams (Varon, 2007).
In previous studies including LM learners and their EO counterparts, particularly those conducted in the United States, there has been a tendency for the
EO group to be of higher SES than the LM group (Lesaux, Koda, Siegel, &
Shanahan, 2006). These unbalanced designs limit insights into the developmental
process of learning two languages. To generate a nuanced understanding of LM
learners' language development and to inform the design of effective practices to
support this development, in-depth empirical investigation is needed, particularly
with attention to linguistic strengths and weaknesses in a sample of LM and EO

speakers from both low- and high-SES backgrounds. Therefore, using a comparative framework, the present study investigates the oral narratives of 12-year-old
(sixth grade) Spanish-speaking US-born children of immigrants (n = 43) and
their native English-speaking classmates (n = 38) from low- and high-SES backgrounds. The study was guided by three research questions:
1. How does the structural organization of oral narratives (i.e., story structure)
compare between early-adolescent LM learners and their EO peers?
2. How do the narratives of early-adolescent LM learners and EO speakers compare on discrete language features, in particular, lexicogrammatical diversity and
accuracy?
3. What is the frequency and pattern of maze use in early-adolescent LM learners,
and how does it compare to their EO counterparts' when telling a story?
METHOD
Participants

Ninety sixth-grade students from a large urban school district in the southwest
United States were selected (from returned parental consent forms distributed in
25 classrooms) to participate in the present study. Participant selection was based
on language status as determined by a demographic questionnaire and SES, as
measured by qualification for free or reduced-price lunch (FRL) with the restriction that there were an equal number of LM and EO students. Data from 9 children
were not analyzed due to low-quality audio recordings (n = 3) or experimenter
error (n = 2). In addition, 4 children were excluded from the final analyses because their cultural background did not match the selection criteria for this study,
which was that LM learners self-identified as Latino and spoke both English and
Spanish at home, whereas EO speakers self-identified as Caucasian and spoke exclusively English at home. Thus, the final sample included 81 sixth-grade students
(M = 12 years, 2 months, SD = 0.47 years) from 21 different classrooms. Consistent with national trends (Gandara et al., 2010), all instruction was provided in
English.
When asked about their home language use, on a 5-point scale ranging from
English only to another language only, the LM group (n = 43, 24 females) reported speaking English and Spanish equally at home (M = 3.18, SE = 0.08).
Twenty-four LM learners (15 females) qualified for FRL, while 19 (9 females)
did not. The majority of LM learners (n = 34; 79%) attended kindergarten in
the same city in which the study took place, 7 (16%) in another US city, and 2
(04%) in Mexico. Further, for a subset of the LM group (n = 24; 16 who qualified for FRL), scores were available on a state-level test of English proficiency
in the areas of listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills: the English Language Development Test (ELDT). The test yields individual skill scores and a
composite score representing five performance levels: beginning (248-441), early
intermediate (442-491), intermediate (492-551), early advanced (552-601), and
advanced (602-741). Per state regulations, the ELDT is administered annually
to all students whose primary home language is not English and who have not
attained "advanced" performance levels in previous years. While the LM group

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4

940

was homogenous in that they used English and Spanish with equal frequency, this
was a heterogeneous group in terms of their English proficiency as measured by
the district-administered ELDT. The overall English language proficiency level of
this subgroup at sixth grade was early advanced (M = 556.58, SD = 40.10; min =
461, max = 622).
Eighteen EO speakers qualified for FRL, but 20 (10 females) did not. The
majority of EO speakers attended kindergarten in the same city in which the study
took place (n = 25; 65%), and 13 (35%) attended kindergarten in another city in
the United States.
Measures

To elicit oral narratives, we used the graphic,
wordless novel Robot Dreams (Varon, 2007). This age-appropriate story, presented
in color comic book like panes, details the friendship of a dog and his mail-order
robot that he builds to keep him company: they spend the day at the library, at
home watching a movie, and at the beach swimming and lying in the sand. The
pair part ways when the robot malfunctions after swimming in the water. A dream
about the day's events prompts the dog to return to his friend only to find the
beach closed and the robot lying inside. To tell the story, the narrator must rely
entirely on the book's illustrations, though there was a limited amount of written
text featured in the stimulus presented, for example, words printed on buildings
("Municipal Library"), labels of containers ("100% Corn Oil"), and sound effects
("CREEEAAK").

Wordless picture book stimulus.

Procedure

Each student was tested individually by one of two trained research assistants,
both native English speakers. The students were told they would need to tell a
story from the pictures in the book to a classmate who did not know the story,
and could not see the pictures. Each student was then shown the first 32 pages,
which contain all of the elements commonly scored in narrative production tasks
(e.g., characters, setting, conflict, and action). After reviewing the book together,
the student was instructed to independently turn the pages and use the pictures to
tell the story. Students were reminded to use enough detail in their story so that
the classmate listening to it would be able to understand the story. The protocol
for prompting during the storytelling was consistent with previous methodology
(Berman & Slobin, 1994) in that minimal prompting was provided (e.g., mmhmm;
is that it?). All students produced narratives in English without being prompted to
do so. All narratives were digitally recorded.
Narrative transcription

The narratives were transcribed using the CHAT conventions of the Child Language Data Exchange System (MacWhinney, 2010). Following Berman and
Slobin (1994), the entire narration was segmented into clauses, which are defined as linguistic units containing a subject and predicate (verb phrase and other

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

941

accompanying elements). This transcription method was chosen in lieu of other
available options (e.g., c-units as cited in Loban, 1976) because it orients the
analyses to the lexical and syntactic levels of language as it visibly highlights, for
example, parallel constructions and grammatical shifts (i.e., use of different subordinator types). In general, clauses contained only one verb (e.g., "then Roberto
fell asleep on the couch"), except in the case of serial verbs constructions (e.g.,
"and they go get the popcorn"), modals (e.g., "he should go home"), and semimodals (e.g., "Dog was going to mail a letter"), which were not treated as forming
separate clauses. We also did not consider side comments to be separate clauses
(e.g., " . . . , I think"). In addition, during transcription, clauses were marked for
mazes. Mazes included filled pauses (e.g., um or uh), false starts/repetitions (e.g.,
"so then <the> the robot's just lying there"), and revisions, either recasts (e.g.,
"and <he was pulling the robot> the dog was pulling the robot") or complete
reformulations (e.g., "<he's putting> maybe he ordered a robot or something").
To ensure transcription reliability, 10% of the transcripts were transcribed by
two independent transcribers; percentage agreement for two independent coders
was 89%. In addition, all transcripts were checked by a second research assistant
trained in CHAT.
Narrative coding

As noted, we took a comprehensive approach to analyzing the narratives told
by LM learners and their EO peers. We assessed not only the story structure
(macrostructural components) but also the discrete language features (microstructural elements) present or absent in the stories, assessing their lexical and grammatical accuracy (i.e., errors) and diversity. We also examined the speech disruptions
that occurred while telling the story aloud (i.e., mazes). To measure interrater reliability of the coding schemes detailed below, 15% of the transcripts were coded
twice on each of these dimensions. There was strong agreement for grammatical
diversity:  = 0.851 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.808, 0.894), mazes,  =
0.834 (95% CI = 0.725, 0.881), and errors,  = 0.803 (95% CI = 0.793, 0.875).
Narratives were coded using the Index of Narrative Complexity
(INC; Petersen et al., 2008), a criterion-referenced coding scheme for assessing
narrative complexity. The INC is composed of 13 elements related to the assessment of macrostructural and microstructural characteristics of narratives, taking
into account the story grammar analysis of Stein and Glenn (1979) and Peterson and McCabe (1983), in addition to the high-point analysis of Labov (1972;
e.g., evaluations). Following modified procedures laid out in Petersen, Gillam,
Spencer, and Gillam (2010), we judged story structure using the macrostructural
components of the INC (character, setting, initiating event, internal response, plan,
action/attempt, complication, and consequence), each yielding scores ranging from
0 to 2 or 0 to 3 (maximum total score = 20).
Given that the INC has historically been used with younger children, we accommodated for the early adolescent population by also adjusting the scoring
scales, but not the design and content, to increase variability within each of the
categories. To do so, we removed the ceiling on the scale. For example, whereas

Story structure.

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4

2 was the highest possible score for the internal response category on the original
scale, the modified scoring system awarded one point for each internal response.
In addition, the modified scoring system penalized participants for being unclear
about the actions of characters in the action/attempt category (i.e., negative scores
were possible). Twenty percent of the transcripts were coded twice for reliability purposes. Reliability for the total INC score was high (intraclass correlations
[ICC] = 0.977). ICC values for the 13 individual categories were also moderate
to high, ranging from 0.804 to 1.00 (M ICC = 0.940).
Discrete language features. Narrative length was measured in both tokens (number of words) and clauses (number of clauses). Vocabulary diversity was determined using the vocd-d program in CLAN (MacWhinney, 2010), which computes
the lexical diversity of the narratives through random sampling of the transcripts
(Duran, Malvern, Richards, & Chipere, 2004). Thus, vocd-d avoids the narrative
length issues inherent in most commonly used measures of lexical diversity, such
as the type-token ratio. Values of vocd-d generally range from 10 to 100 (McKee,
Malvern, & Richards, 2000), where low values of D reflect a lower lexical diversity and high values reflect greater lexical diversity. To provide the most accurate
description of students' own linguistic skill, words in the text were excluded from
these analyses.
Grammatical diversity was coded manually in the transcripts and measured
the range and variety of subordinator types used to construct dependent clauses.
Dependent clauses, also commonly referred to as subordinate clauses, are defined
as clauses that require a main clause. Subordinate clauses are typically introduced
by subordinating conjunctions (e.g., "he started wagging his tail when he finally
saw the mailman") or relative pronouns (e.g., "the story is about a dog who buys
a robot"). For ease of presentation, we refer to these markers as subordinators.
We calculated the total number of clauses, dependent clauses, and the number of
different subordinators employed or implied (e.g., "he got all of the supplies [that]
he needed"). The number of different subordinator types over the total number of
dependent clauses indicates the variety in children's inventory of subordinators.
That is, a child with a low ratio of subordinator types indicates a story constructed
by combining clauses using the same subordinator (e.g., "when the mailman
knocked on his door, he gave him a box . . . when he made his robot, he went
to the library . . . when he goes to the library, he gets a book") and a high
ratio indicates the child used a variety of subordinator types (e.g., "the story's
about a dog who buys a robot . . . while he's watching the movie, the robot
falls asleep . . . [they] pick out a travel book which is Cameron's Guide to Dog
Beaches").
Of note, the literature on narratives includes various measures of grammatical complexity, including MLU (Rojas & Iglesias, 2013). However, researchers
generally agree that past early childhood, MLU is not a reliable measure of complexity (Klee & Fitzgerald, 1985; Scarborough, Rescorla, Tager-Flusberg, Fowler,
& Sudhalter, 1991), partly because of the variability within age groups, and agree
that length alone is not a good indicator of grammatical complexity. The use
of subordinate clauses continues to develop through the school-age years (Nippold, 2007). As such, an alternative measure is the subordination index, which is

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

943

calculated by dividing the number of subordinate clauses over the number of total
clauses in the story. Guided by previous research, in particular Pearson's (2002)
study showing virtually no difference in subordination between EO speakers and
LM learners by fifth grade, we focused on the diversity with which children used
subordinators, not just whether their stories contained subordination.
In addition, each clause was coded for grammatical and lexical errors (see
Table 1). An error was coded as grammatical when it involved omission or incorrect use of morphemes that contributed grammatical information to the clause,
that is, errors in word order or incorrect use/exclusion of function words (articles,
auxiliary verbs, and conjunctions, including subordinating conjunctions and relative pronouns), prepositions, or inflections (comparison, number, case, gender,
tense, or aspect). Errors were coded as lexical when they contributed meaning
beyond grammatical information. Thus, lexical errors involved incorrect usage of
base words (i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) or derivational affixes (i.e.,
prefix and suffix). Of note, when a clause excluded a (required) main verb, we
counted this as a grammatical error.
Given that errors could be corrected in more than one way, we took the approach to make the minimum number of changes required to make clauses lexically/grammatically correct in the discourse context [e.g., "Then he woked up in
the middle of the night" = Then he woke up in the middle of the night (grammatical, inflection error, past tense, 1 change)  Then he awoke O in the middle of
the night (two changes)]. We took into account the context of the statements being
made and the message in preceding and proceeding clauses, while excluding any
material in mazes. To further minimize this issue of double-coding, errors also
potentially due to mispronunciations were noted as phonological errors, but placed
within the existing grammatical and lexical categories [e.g., "They sleeped on a
blanket" = They slept on a blanket (grammatical, inflection, past tense error)]. It
should be noted that while an exploration of the varieties of English (see Craig
& Washington, 2002; Fought, 2003) was outside the main focus of this study, we
did exclude instances of multiple negation (n = 7 instances; n = 4 students; all
double negatives) from our error counts because this feature is widely used in several varieties of English and is "standard" in many other languages (Labov, 1972;
Kortmann & Szmrecsanyi, 2004; Adger, Wolfram, & Christian, 2007). Similarly,
we excluded from our error counts the use of "hisself" (n = 7 instances; n = 6
students). For each participant, we calculated the total number of errors and the
number of each error type divided by the total number of errors.
Following a modified version of the conventions laid out by Bedore et al.
(2006), we coded for lexical and grammatical revisions, filled pauses, repetitions,
and phonological revisions (see Table 2). It is worth noting that in coding for
phonological revisions, we followed the strategy noted earlier: if material within a
maze was potentially due to mispronunciations, these were noted as phonological
errors, but only when they could not be placed within the grammatical and lexical
revision categories. We tallied the total number of mazes used. For each participant,
we also divided the number of maze types used by the total number of total clauses
to get a percentage of maze type.

Data analysis plan

It was prudent to account for transcript size in the analyses of narratives given the
differences in the length of stories produced. While calculating a proportion score
to control for transcript size and comparing group differences using an analysis of
variance (ANOVA) is a widely used approach, recent investigations have shown
that the use of proportions can produce spurious results when using an ANOVA
even after an arcsine-square root transformation has been performed to meet the
normality assumption (see Jaeger, 2008). Thus, an ANOVA was used only for
outcome variables that inherently take into account differences in length (e.g.,
story structure: original and modified INC scores; vocabulary diversity: voc-d);
these outcome variables for ANOVAs were continuous and normally distributed.
Two-way ANOVAs were performed with language status (language minority vs.
EO) and SES (low vs. high) as between-subject factors.
For all other analyses (e.g., grammatical diversity: subordinator types; accuracy:
errors; maze use), we relied on mixed-effects logistic modeling, which allowed
us to model our outcome variables as categorical (hits or misses) instead of

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

946

proportions. Mixed-effects logistic models are a generalization of logit regression.
Unlike ordinary logit models, the mixed part of logistic model refers to modeling of
both random (e.g., subject effects) and fixed effects. In these analyses, each subject
can contribute a different amount of data; each clause represents a data point. The
models included a dichotomous outcome variable representing the occurrence of
a particular linguistic feature (1 = yes, 0 = no) at each clause and, as such, can be
interpreted as the likelihood of a narrative including a particular linguistic feature
or not. The models also included the between-subject variables language status
(EO = 0, LM learner = 1) and SES Status (low = 0, high = 1) as dichotomous
and fixed factors; participant was included as a random factor. An interaction
term (Language Status x SES) was included to test whether the relation between
language status and the occurrence of a particular linguistic feature differs for lowand high-SES groups. Where there were differences between EO and LM learners,
follow-up analyses on the LM learners' narratives were carried out as a function
of ELDT performance levels; this assessment served as an additional measure
of language skill. Specifically, comparisons were made between the narratives of
LM learners with ELDT scores below "advanced" levels and those of LM learners
with "advanced" performance on the ELDT (ELDT status: advanced = 0, not
advanced = 1).

RESULTS
Story structure

There was limited variability in this sample's original INC scores (see descriptives
in Table 3), and the story structure scores (combined macrostructure components)
were comparable between SES groups, and EO speakers and LM learners. Separate two-way ANOVAs (language status: LM vs. EO; SES: low vs. high) on
story structure revealed no significant differences between EO and LM learners,
F (1, 77) = 2.728, p = .103, 2p = 0.034, or SES groups, F (1, 77) = 0.153,
p = .697, 2p = 0.002, and no significant interaction effects, F (1, 77) = 1.321, p =
.254, 2p = 0.017. A similar pattern of nonsignificant results (ps > .05) was found
when using the modified scoring system despite more variability within the full
sample (M = 48.99, SD = 13.44). Thus, we report only the original INC scores
in Table 3.
Guided by prior studies revealing differences between EO and LM learners
on separate story elements (e.g., Fiestas & Pena, 2004), a two-way multivariate
ANOVA (language status and SES) was performed on the macrostructural elements only, excluding categories with no variability (in an attempt to reduce the
number of comparisons). The results of the omnibus ANOVA revealed no significant differences by language status, the Roy largest root = 0.136, F (6, 72) =
1.628, p = .153, 2p = 0.119, or SES, the Roy largest root = 0.108, F (6, 72) =
1.292, p = .272, 2p = 0.097, and no significant interaction, the Roy largest root =
0.105, F (6, 72) = 1.261, p = .286, 2p = 0.095. The lack of a statistical difference is
in spite of the consistently higher scores for LM learners in the internal responses
category (M = 2.00, SD = 0.00) than EO speakers (M = 1.79, SD = 0.43).

Lexical and grammatical diversity and accuracy

As noted, we expected to find variability on a measure of narrative length (see
Table 3), and we were particularly interested in whether length varied as a function of language status and SES. Separate two-way ANOVAs revealed that LM
learners' narratives contained more total tokens (M = 310.09, SD = 90.29) than
EO speakers' narratives (M = 257.58, SD = 113.03), F (1, 77) = 5.717, p = .019,
2p = 0.069. LM learners' narratives also contained more total clauses (M = 84.47,
SD = 24.56) than EO speakers' (M = 70.92, SD = 31.66), F (1, 77) = 4.748, p =
.032, 2p = 0.058. SES was not a significant factor for either tokens, F (1, 77) =
0.000, p = .992, 2p = 0.000, or clauses, F (1, 77) = 0.079, p = .779, 2p = 0.001,
nor was there an interaction effect for tokens, F (1, 77) = 3.319, p = .072, 2p =
0.041, or clauses, F (1, 77) = 2.074, p = .154, 2p = 0.026. Follow-up ANOVAs
showed that LM learners' story length, determined by either tokens or clauses, did
not vary as a function of ELDT performance levels (ps > .05).

948

A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between language status and SES, F (1, 77) = 5.07, p = .027, 2p =
0.062, but no significant main effect of language status, F (1, 77) = 0.763, p =
.385, 2p = 0.010, or SES, F (1, 77) = 0.928, p = .338, 2p = 0.012, on voc-d, our
measure of lexical diversity. These results indicate that the two language groups
did not differ from each other, but that the impact of SES was different for LM
and EO students. Follow-up comparisons showed no difference in vocabulary
diversity between EO students from low- (M = 54.74; SD = 13.27) and highincome backgrounds (M = 51.17; SD = 8.0), F (1, 36) = 0.862, p = .359, 2p =
0.023. Yet LM learners from high-income backgrounds used more diverse vocabulary in their narratives (M = 54.50, SD = 13.27) than did LM learners from
low-income backgrounds (M = 46.41, SD = 13.27), F (1, 41) = 5.073, p = .030,
2p = 0.110.
In contrast to the finding of no difference between the two language groups
on our measure of lexical diversity, descriptive results showed that EO speakers
showed greater grammatical diversity than did LM learners. For example, EO
speakers used a greater proportion of subordinator types (M = 0.54, SD = 0.24)
than did LM learners (M = 0.46, SD = 0.16). To assess these potential differences
in grammatical diversity, we built a logistic model to predict the use of different
subordinator types: each clause was coded as whether or not it introduced a new
subordinator. Language status was found to be a significant factor (coefficient =
-0.28, SE = 0.12, z-value = -2.38, p < .05, CI = -0.51, -0.5, 2 = 6.23, df = 2,
p < .05), while SES status was not (coefficient = 0.08, SE = 0.12, z = 7.0, p >
.05, CI = -0.15, 0.31), and neither was the interaction term (coefficient = -0.37,
SE = 0.23, z = -1.58, p > .05, CI = -0.83, 0.09). Follow-up logistic regression
analyses including only the LM group showed that their use of subordinators did
not vary as a function of ELDT performance levels (coefficient = -0.206, SE =
0.18, z = -1.13, p > .05, CI = -0.56, 0.15). Together, these results indicate that
there is a greater probability that the EO speakers would use a more diverse set
of subordinators to construct their stories than the LM learners, regardless of SES
or their ELDT performance levels. Moreover, the proportion of dependent clauses
(i.e., number of dependent clauses over the total number of clauses; M EO =
0.17, SE = 0.06; M LM = 0.16, SE = 0.06) did not vary as a function of our key
predictors (e.g., language status: coefficient = -0.12, SE = 0.10, z = -1.28, p >
.05, CI = -0.32, 0.07).
Lexical and grammatical diversity.

Accuracy. Errors were committed at the grammatical (i.e., function or inflection)
and lexical (i.e., base or affix) levels. LM learners committed a greater number of
errors (M = 5.12, SD = 3.90) than did their EO counterparts (M = 1.00, SD =
1.12), and the number of errors was significantly correlated with narrative length
in clauses (r = .293, p < .05, n = 81). Figure 1 also shows that LM learners'
narratives contained a higher percentage of errors that were grammatical than did
EO speakers' narratives, but there was no difference between the groups in the
percentage of errors that were lexical errors. The difference in errors between EOs
and LM learners was most marked for function word errors. Whereas less than a
quarter of EO speakers' errors were function word errors, about half of LM learners' total errors were classified as such, in particular, in/on/at preposition errors.

number of errors of a particular type over the total number of errors in each student's narrative.

It is worth noting that their preposition errors were classified as commissions, not
errors of omission. In particular, over 95% of errors coded as preposition errors
were due to the use of an incorrect preposition.
A series of logistic regression models predicting each error type (see Table 4)
revealed a greater likelihood that the LM group would produce more function
word and inflection errors than the EO group. The lack of a significant interaction
suggests that for the participating children, being from a low-SES background did
not affect LM learners' risk for making errors, as compared to their EO peers.
Follow-up analyses with the LM group further revealed that students with lower
than "advanced" performance levels on the ELDT were more likely to commit
function (ELDT status: coefficient = 0.518, SE = 0.25, z = 2.048, p < .05, CI
= 0.02, 1.01) and inflection errors (ELDT status: coefficient = 0.939, SE = 0.36,
z = 2.611, p < .05, CI = 0.23, 1.64) in comparison to LM students with "advanced"
performance levels. LM learners' vocd-d was related to their total errors in a
negative direction (r = -.377, p = .013, n = 43), indicating that students with
lower vocabulary diversity committed the most errors. Vocabulary diversity was
not significantly correlated with EO speakers' total errors (r = .124, p = .458,
n = 38), which may be due to the relatively low number of errors committed by
EO speakers overall.
Maze use

LM learners exhibited a greater number of mazes (M = 26.14, SD = 14.17) than
did their EO counterparts (M = 14.76, SD = 11.37), and the number of mazes

of repetitions and grammatical revisions by LM learners than by EO speakers
(see Table 4). The models predicting filled pauses and lexical errors revealed no
significant predictors or interactions (ps > .05). Moreover, the consistent lack of
a significant interaction effect suggests that, for the sample studied, being from a
low-SES background did not affect LM learners differently than EO speakers with

respect to risk for mazes. Table 5 shows the percentage of grammatical revisions
by subcategory for EO and LM learners. As shown, LM learners' tendency was to
revise their use of pronouns (choosing a different pronoun or including one after
failing to do so initially), followed by choosing a different conjunction, whereas

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4

the great majority of grammatical revisions exhibited by EO speakers resulted in
a change of their choice of conjunction.
Follow-up analyses indicated that speakers' tendency to use mazes was related
to measures of advanced linguistic knowledge. In particular, logistic regression
analyses showed that LM learners with "advanced" performance levels on the
ELDT were more likely to exhibit grammatical revisions than were LM learners
with lower than advanced performance levels (ELDT status: coefficient = -0.653,
SE = 0.24, z = -2.70, p < .05, CI = -1.13, -0.18). The use of repetitions by
the LM group did not differ by ELDT performance (ELDT status: coefficient =
0.264, SE = 0.31, z = 0.840, p < .05, CI = -0.35, 0.88). In addition, while no
association was found for LM learners (r = -.075, p = .631, n = 43), EO speakers'
total number of mazes was found to be significantly correlated with vocd-d (r =
.477, p = .002, n = 38), suggesting that attempts at increasing the diversity of the
vocabulary used to construct narratives increases the tendency to exhibit mazes.
DISCUSSION

For the growing population of LM learners in today's schools, large-scale, standardized measures of achievement (National Center for Education Statistics
[NCES], 2013; Planty et al., 2009) demonstrate that, on average, this population's
achievement and language proficiency is low. While obtaining such information is
important for reasons of educational equity and accountability, in-depth empirical
investigation is needed to generate nuanced and sufficiently informative models of
their language development and targeted instructional supports. To that end, in the
present study, we went beyond the format of the standardized language or literacy
measure and compared the oral narratives of 12-year-old Spanish-speaking LM
learners (US-born and educated children of immigrants) to those of their EO peers.
Our fine-grained analysis of early adolescents' oral narratives revealed sources of
strength for LM learners and unique aspects of their language development. Discussed in turn below, our findings showed that the narratives of early-adolescent
EO speakers and LM learners did not differ on their structural characteristics;
instead, the discrete language features of the stories told and the use of mazes
differed between the groups.
Areas of strength for LM learners

More specifically, and perhaps most importantly, LM learners' performance on a
measure of story structure was not different from that of their EO peers. The
lack of difference in story structure is consistent with research documenting
young Spanish-speaking LM learners' growth in narrative skill (Melzi et al., 2013;
Pearson, 2002). This pattern of results indicates that, by middle school, LM learners have well-developed skills in producing stories within a goal-action-outcome
framework (Stein & Glenn, 1979). The lack of difference in the structural organization of LM learners' narratives from EO speakers is significant when considering
that narrative skill is linked to academic and reading outcomes (Miller et al., 2006),
yet this is a group that demonstrates low academic achievement on average and
has significant challenges in the domain of reading comprehension (Lesaux et al.,

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

953

2010; Mancilla-Martinez & Lesaux, 2010; Proctor, Carlo, August, & Snow, 2005;
NCES, 2013; Swanson, Rosston, Gerber, & Solari, 2008). Of note, the identification of reading difficulties typically comes from developmental studies that
confound language status with SES. In contrast, a major strength of this study was
the inclusion of participants from low- and high-SES backgrounds (as measured
by qualification for FRL). We found few interaction effects of language status and
SES, indicating that, by far, the low-SES group exhibited lower performance on
the narrative measures than did the high-SES group, regardless of language status.
Although we controlled for differences in SES, our LM and EO groups differed
by cultural/ethnic background, in addition to language status. Yet, while other
studies, albeit mostly focused on young children's personal and not fictional
narratives, show cultural variations in emphasis on specific story elements (Melzi,
2000), there was no difference in the reliance on one story element over another
by this sample of Caucasian EOs and Latino LM learners. In contrast, at least
one cross-cultural study of children's narratives, elicited from wordless pictures
books, suggests that the cultural experiences Latino children bring to the narrative
task impacts the stylistic features of their stories. In that study, Spanish-speaking
Latino children tended to include character names more often than Caucasian
EO children who made more references to the nature of character relationships.
The authors explained that this practice mirrors the tendency of Latino parents to
recite family members' names during their personal stories (Cristofaro & TamisLeMonda, 2008). With prior cross-cultural and cross-language findings in mind
(Fiestas & Pena, 2004), our finding that the LM group scored slightly higher on
internal responses than did the EO group, a difference that failed to reach statistical
significance, may be indicative of a cultural influence with respect to how the story
structure elements are incorporated, and not necessarily whether they are included
or not. This finding and hypothesis is worthy of further research.
Although the findings of no difference in language outcomes between EO and
LM learners shed light on comparable strengths between the groups, we argue
that findings of between-group differences can also explain sources of strength
for LM learners. For example, it has been suggested that the use of mazes implies a certain degree of linguistic knowledge because it signals that the narrator
has recognized linguistic breakdowns and attempts to revise them (Bedore et al.,
2006; Kormos, 1999). Our results showed LM learners, as a group, exhibited more
mazes than their EO counterparts, which may suggest they have more metalinguistic knowledge, perhaps from speaking their two languages on a regular basis
(Bialystok, Craik, Green, & Gollam, 2009). LM learners with advanced levels of
English proficiency were more likely to exhibit grammatical revisions than were
LM learners with lower than advanced performance. Consistent with this idea, we
found that EOs with greater vocabulary diversity exhibited more mazes than did
EOs whose narratives demonstrated lower vocabulary diversity. As Leadholm and
Miller (1992) suggest, EO speakers' attempts at increasing the complexity of the
language used to construct narratives may have resulted in more monitoring, thus
revising of their speech (Levelt, 1989). Support for the relation between linguistic
knowledge and mazes comes from the type of grammatical revisions consistently
made. The most common type of grammatical revision by EOs resulted in a change
in conjunction type (40% of all errors), including subordinators, which indexed

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

954

grammatical diversity; for LM learners, grammatical revisions more likely resulted
in a change in pronouns (29%) or conjunctions (27%).
Unique aspects of linguistic development for LM learners

As noted, differences between LM learners and EO speakers in the present study
were found at the linguistic level, primarily in grammar. In particular, LM learners
produced longer narratives in comparison to their EO peers, and yet, their stories
were constructed using a smaller repertoire of subordinators, our indicator of
grammatical diversity. That is, consistent with the previous literature (Pearson,
2002), LM and EO learners did not differ in their amount of subordination. Instead,
we found that EO speakers used a more diverse set of subordinators than did LM
learners (54% vs. 46% of the total number of dependent clauses included different
subordinators). Thus, LM learners' stories included more repetition and were less
grammatically diverse (e.g., "when the mailman knocked on his door, he gave him
a box . . . when he made his robot, he went to the library"). This finding is also
in line with the findings from a narrative production study with early-adolescent
Spanish-Hebrew speakers that showed they used a smaller range of relative clauses
in comparison to their monolingual (Spanish) counterparts, which we included in
our subordinator counts (Kupersmitt, 2004). Together, these two studies (one
focused on Spanish and ours focused on English) may signal a general tendency
for the use of less diverse grammatical forms by speakers of two languages, worthy
of further investigation. These findings of less diverse language use support the
position that the frequency of and quality of exposure to language is an important
factor to consider in language development, especially for LM learners who, as
others by virtue of speaking two languages, may have less time in each language
(see Hoff, 2013).
Our analyses further revealed that, as a group, LM learners' narratives included
more grammatical errors than their EO peers', the majority of which were errors in
the use of prepositions. Of note, it is possible that grammatical and lexical errors
reflected phonological errors more so than our descriptive results would suggest,
an alternative that we cannot entirely rule out because a thorough investigation of
phonological errors was beyond the scope of the present study. At the same time,
incorrect use of prepositions cannot easily be attributed to a phonological error,
such as a mispronunciation. Instead, and consistent with cross-linguistic narrative
studies that reveal differences between languages in the use of specific grammatical
features and vocabulary (Berman & Slobin, 1994; Stromqvist & Verhoeven, 2004;
Verhoeven & Stromqvist, 2001), these errors are more likely explained as a transfer
effect from Spanish to English. For example, errors in using the prepositions
in/on/at were the most common for LM learners, presumably because in Spanish,
these three prepositions are encompassed by a single preposition en (Coventry
et al., 2012). Our analyses with respect to errors in the case of prepositions also
showed that LM learners committed more errors of commission than omission; that
is, they tended to use an incorrect preposition instead of omitting one altogether.
In particular, we found that LM learners with lower than advanced proficiency
in English were more likely to commit grammatical errors in comparison to
their LM peers who had reached advanced proficiency in English. The negative

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4
Gamez et al.: Narrative production skills of language minority learners

955

relation between LM learners' vocabulary diversity and their use of errors also
indicates that learners with lower vocabulary diversity committed more errors.
These results highlight the heterogeneity within the LM group; that is, while having
been educated in English and using their two languages with equal frequency,
differences emerged as a function of their eventual language skill.
In addition, while we did not find an overall difference in the diversity of vocabulary used by EO and LM learners, we found a difference in vocabulary diversity as
a function of SES. That is, EO speakers from high- and low-income backgrounds
did not differ on the diversity of vocabulary used in their narratives, whereas
LM learners from lower income backgrounds demonstrated lower vocabulary diversity than their LM peers from higher income backgrounds. Thus, although
poverty poses risks for all children, LM learners from low-income households
may be particularly vulnerable in the domain of vocabulary. This is particularly
concerning given that Spanish-speaking LM learners disproportionately live in
poverty (Lopez & Velasco, 2011) and drop out of school at rates twice as high as
their monolingual EO peers (Fry, 2010). These circumstances increase their own
chances of generational poverty, while reinforcing the need to consider the role of
the instructional environments in bolstering language development for schools in
high-poverty neighborhoods serving large numbers of LM learners.
Limitations and future research

Despite the promise of this study and its methods for generating important insights
about the learner's language use, several limitations to be addressed in subsequent
research should be noted. Much of the research on narrative production skills
has been conducted with young children; for this reason, finding an appropriate
stimulus and prompt for this population was a challenge, particularly with regard
to eliciting academic language. The prompt we used did not necessarily elicit
formal or more academic uses of language, which may explain why we did not get
an overall difference in the diversity of vocabulary used by EO and LM learners.
With a different prompt we may have detected differences in the use of academic
vocabulary words between the groups. Related to the prompt, a small amount of
written text was available to participants in the graphic novel. The inclusion of
written text may have influenced the production of narratives, for example, by
highlighting particular events in the story that students may have not otherwise
attended to, or may have attended to differently in the absence of text. Future
research would do well to further compare the effects of different prompts (see
Fiestas & Pena, 2004), for example, those devoid of any writing to those with
written text on students' narrative production.
In addition, while this comparative study provides important insight into how
LM learners are productive with language in relation to their EO classmates, answering questions about whether their production in specific domains of language
reflects a deficit versus a developmental lag requires comprehensive, longitudinal
study. For example, while we identified key differences between LM learners and
EO students on some specific measures of their linguistic skills, particularly those
in the domain of grammar, and substantiated these with an additional measure
of language proficiency, it remains of question whether with additional years of

Applied Psycholinguistics 37:4

956

exposure to English, the LM learners will produce language in an academic setting
that is devoid of cross-linguistic influences.
This study was conducted with one particular sample of LM learners: Spanishspeaking households. Thus, the findings should not only be replicated with larger
samples of Spanish speakers but should also be investigated with other groups of
LM learners from different language backgrounds. Although Spanish constitutes
the language spoken by the great majority of LM learners in the United States,
there are more than 400 other languages spoken by LM learners (Ryan, 2013).
In this study, we identified the clear influence of Spanish in the LM students'
English production; other languages are likely to influence English acquisition
and production differently.
Conclusions

For the sample of early adolescents studied, it is clear that the LM learners
had acquired enough knowledge about story elements, as well as lexical and
grammatical knowledge, to create complex narratives. To substantiate these claims,
we found a lack of difference between EO and LM learners' use of complex story
structure, vocabulary, and use of subordination (i.e., complex syntax). Adding to
this list of strengths, this study provided evidence that linguistic background is
a source of strength for LM learners: their use of mazes may be indicative of
metalinguistic knowledge. Because they were educated entirely in US schools
by early adolescence, the participating LM learners showed command of the
different elements that makes for an effective narrative (e.g., inclusion of an
action/attempt, outcome, and goals of story characters). However, their lack of
subordinator diversity indicates that while LM learners clearly have command of
the grammar, they did not use the grammar in more diverse ways. Moreover, the
finding of an increase in grammatical errors suggests that the typical academic
experience provided to these US-born children of Spanish-speaking immigrants
may not have been sufficient to develop their command of the English language to
nativelike levels in the academic setting. This is particularly the case with regard
to preposition use. Consistent with and extending the narrative literature focused
on younger LM learners (Uccelli & Paez, 2007), the findings from this study with
older LM learners reinforce the need to delve more deeply into understanding this
population's development, including the strengths that underlie their academic
performance, in order to better target instructional supports to further develop
their English language skills.
