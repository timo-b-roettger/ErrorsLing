We contrasted the effect of instruction-induced expectancies and language intermixing in an English lexical decision task
performed by DutchEnglish bilinguals. At the start of the experiment, participants were instructed to respond to
interlingual homographs and exclusively English words by giving a yes'' response, and to English non-words and
exclusively Dutch words by giving a no'' response. In the (R)rst part of the experiment the stimulus list did not contain any
Dutch words. In the second part of the experiment, Dutch items were introduced. No signi(R)cant differences were found
between interlingual homographs and controls in the (R)rst part of the experiment, while strong inhibition effects were
obtained for interlingual homographs in the second part. These results indicate that language intermixing rather than
instruction-based expectancies drives the bilingual partipants' performance. Consequences for current views on bilingual
word recognition are discussed.

One issue that has dominated bilingual research in
the last 25 years is whether access to the bilingual
lexicon is basically language selective or non-selective
in nature. On the basis of an increasing amount of
evidence, more and more researchers are convinced
that the bilingual word recognition system is basically
non-selective in nature, but that, dependent on a
number of experimental and non-experimental
factors, more or less selective result patterns may be
obtained (Dijkstra & Van Heuven, 1998; Dijkstra,
Van Jaarsveld, & Ten Brinke, 1998; Grainger, 1993;
Grosjean, 1998, in press). Which factors are most
effectively inuencing the bilinguals' performance
and how they interact has only recently become a
focus of systematic study (see Grosjean, in press, for
a review of the available evidence). For bilingual
word recognition, this paper considers the effect of
two of these factors in more detail: task instruction
(does the instruction indicate that one or two languages will be important to perform the task?) and
stimulus list composition, in particular language intermixing (are words from only one or from two
languages present in the experiment?).
Both factors play a role in the notion of a language mode'', developed by Grosjean (1985, 1997a,
1998, in press). In their everyday lives, bilinguals are
assumed to (R)nd themselves in various general lan-

guage modes'' that correspond to points on a monolingualbilingual mode continuum. A mode is a state
of activation of the bilingual's languages and language processing mechanisms. At one end of the
continuum, if the bilinguals are in a totally monolingual mode (for instance, when they are interacting
with monolinguals of one of the languages they
know), only the appropriate language is kept active
and the other is deactivated. At the other end of the
continuum, the bilinguals are in a bilingual language
mode if they are communicating with bilinguals who
share their two languages. In this case, both languages are active but the one that is used as the main
language of communication (called the base language) is more active than the other.
Because a particular mode corresponds to a state
of activation of the bilingual's languages and language processing mechanisms, it is assumed to inuence both language production (maintenance or
change of the base language, amount and type of
language intermixing that takes place, etc.) and language perception (speed of processing of a language,
access to one or both lexicons, role of the less
activated language, etc.) (Grosjean, 1998, 170). Grosjean, 1998, 137) has recently applied the notion of the
language mode to language perception and reading
as follows:

go along, that what they are listening to can contain

elements from the other language, they will put themselves
in a bilingual mode (at least partly), that is, activate both
their languages (with the base language being more strongly
activated). This is also true of readers, whether they are
reading a continuous text or looking at individual lexical
items interspersed with items from the other language.
Simply knowing that there is a possibility that elements
from the other language will be presented (in an experiment, for example) will move the bilingual away from the
monolingual endpoint of the continuum. Just one guest
word in a stream of base language words can increase this
displacement.

In sum, according to Grosjean (a) the bilingual's
language mode affects lexical access to the bilingual
lexicon during word reading, and (b) the language
mode is affected both by the readers' (linguistic)
expectations (e.g., due to the instruction for the
experiment) and by language intermixing (stimulus
list composition).
Recent studies have started to address these issues
empirically. Dijkstra et al. (1998) examined the
effects of task instruction and language intermixing
in two lexical decision experiments that provided the
starting point for the present study. In the (R)rst
experiment, DutchEnglish bilinguals performed an
English lexical decision task on a list of words
including EnglishDutch homographs and cognates,
as well as exclusively English control words. Interlingual homographs were de(R)ned as words having
the same orthography but different meanings across
different languages. An example is the word LIST,
which means trick'' or guile'' in Dutch. Cognates
were de(R)ned as words with both identical orthography and largely overlapping semantics. An
example is HOTEL. The experiment did not result in
any signi(R)cant RT (response time) differences for
interlingual homographs relative to exclusively
English control words, analogous to earlier (R)ndings
by Gerard & Scarborough (1989) for Spanish
English bilinguals. For cognates, Dijkstra et al. observed a facilitation effect relative to exclusively
English control words. Dijkstra et al. interpreted this
(R)nding as evidence in favor of non-selective access.
This implies that the null-effect for interlingual
homographs was not a consequence of selective
access, but of some other characteristic(s) of the
experimental situation.
This hypothesis was tested in Dijkstra et al.'s
second experiment. DutchEnglish bilinguals again
performed an English lexical decision on interlingual
homographs, exclusively English control items, and
non-words, but now the experimental stimuli also
included Dutch words requiring a no'' response
(i.e., the Dutch words had to be treated as English
non-words''). Here, a dramatic change was observed

in the RTs to homographs: relative to English
control items, strong inhibitory effects were obtained.
The participants apparently found it dif(R)cult to
respond yes'' to these words. Furthermore, the RT
difference between homographs and matched control
words was found to depend on the relative frequency
difference of the two readings of the homograph: the
inhibitory effect was large when the Dutch reading of
the homographs had a high frequency relative to the
English reading.
Dijkstra et al. (1998) explained the different results
in their Experiments 1 and 2 in terms of a difference
in the relative degree of non-target (Dutch) language
activation. The Dutch items in Experiment 2 activate
the non-target language Dutch to a higher degree
than in Experiment 1 where no Dutch items occurred
in the list. This leads to relatively more competition
between the two readings of interlingual homographs
in Experiment 2. Thus, according to this account the
different results in the two experiments are a consequence of different bottom-up activation processes
due to the composition of the stimulus list.
Grosjean (in press) interpreted these results somewhat differently, as (indirect) evidence for an effect of
language mode during perception. In Experiment 1,
the participants only read English words and nonwords (although some words were homographs and
cognates) and they were instructed to decide whether
the items were English words or not. This would have
positioned them towards the monolingual end of the
mode continuum, but they did not reach this position
totally as they knew they were being tested as bilinguals. Thus, although their Dutch was partly active
(which would explain the cognate effect) it was not
suf(R)ciently active to create a homograph effect. In
sum, Grosjean (in press) assumed that both task
instruction (English lexical decision) and degree of
language intermixing (encountering mostly English
words) affected the bilinguals' performance in the
experiment.
Recently, De Groot, Delmaar, & Lupker (in press)
replicated the basic results observed by Dijkstra et al.
(1998). With respect to the observed differences
between Dijkstra et al.'s Experiments 1 and 2 they
proposed a theoretical interpretation that is different
from both Dijkstra et al.'s and Grosjean's accounts.
As they pointed out, in Experiment 1 the task may
not always have been carried out according to the
instructions. The participants were instructed to
perform a language speci(R)c'' English lexical decision
task, but on some trials they may instead have
treated the task as a language neutral'' lexical
decision task, i.e. they may have ignored the language
a particular item belonged to. The adoption of a
language speci(R)c'' processing mode by some partici-

Interlingual homograph recognition
pants or on some trials would be expected to induce
slower responses to homographs than to matched
controls because, in a non-selective access system,
not only the target reading but also the non-target
language reading of a homograph would be activated, leading to lexical competition and slower
responses ( just like in Experiment 2 by Dijkstra et
al., 1998). In contrast, in a language neutral'' processing mode the response to a homograph would be
based on the availability of any reading, irrespective
of language, and homographs could then be responded to faster than controls (as in the generalized
lexical decision task of Experiment 3 by Dijkstra et
al., 1998). In sum, it could be that a mixture of the
two processing modes adopted by the participants
leads to a mixture of facilitation and inhibition
effects for homographs, yielding an overall nullresult.1
In this context, it is revealing to examine the
instruction given to the participants in Experiment 1
by Dijkstra et al. (1998) and the comparable experiments by De Groot et al. (in press), and Gerard &
Scarborough (1989). Neither in the (R)rst experiment
by Dijkstra et al., nor in De Groot et al.'s Experiment
2 (Condition English), were the participants told that
some of the to be presented letter strings would be
words in both Dutch and English. As far as can be
determined on the basis of the article by Gerard &
Scarborough (1989), the same was true for Part 1 of
their experiment.
It is therefore possible that participants in these
experiments sometimes adopted a language neutral''
processing mode simply because they were in an
uncertain situation. Moreover, the speci(R)cs of the
experimental situation allowed the participants to
respond with some exibility at no apparent cost,
because a Dutch word was always an English word
as well, namely an interlingual homograph. Therefore, the participants in the experiments never made
a response error if they responded on the basis of the
(R)rst available reading of the homograph (it is a
word''; language neutral processing mode) rather
than on basis of the English reading only after
excluding the Dutch reading (it is an English word'';
language speci(R)c processing mode). This uncertainty
did not exist for the participants in Experiment 2 by
Dijkstra et al., who were explicitly instructed to say
no'' to Dutch words, which they encountered from
the very beginning of the experiment. Applying the
same exible strategy as in Experiment 1 would
1

Note that none of these accounts hinges on a null-effect. In fact,
some recent studies have found slower RTs for interlingual
homographs than for matched controls (Brysbaert, personal
communication; Von Studnitz & Green, submitted).

71

immediately have been punished by an increased
error rate. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the
instruction as formulated in Experiment 1, in combination with the speci(R)cs of the stimulus list composition (language intermixing), underlies the null-results
in that experiment.
To disentangle the effects of instruction and language intermixing, we designed an experiment that
combined features of Experiments 1 and 2 by Dijkstra et al. (1998). Before the start of the experiment,
we instructed the participants explicitly that they
would encounter interlingual homographs requiring
a yes'' response, as well as exclusively Dutch words
requiring a no'' response. We also provided them
with examples of these stimuli in the practice set. We
manipulated language intermixing by including exclusively Dutch words only in the second part of the
experiment but not in the (R)rst part. Furthermore, in
order to examine local effects of the inclusion of
Dutch items in the list, we carefully controlled the
presence of speci(R)c items at the end of the (R)rst part
and the beginning of the second part.
These design features allowed us to test the following predictions. If the instruction is a determinant
of relative language activation in word recognition
(as argued by Grosjean, 1998), then bilinguals should
activate both languages in part 1 of the present
experiment, because both instruction and practice set
stress the relevance of both languages in the experiment. This should induce a different pattern of
results than in the implicit instruction'' situation of
Experiment 1 by Dijkstra et al. (1998), i.e. we should
obtain inhibitory effects on the responses to the
homographs (similar to those obtained in Experiment
2 by Dijkstra et al.). If, however, language intermixing rather than degree of explicitness in instruction underlies the different results in Experiments 1
versus 2 by Dijkstra et al. (as argued by these
authors), part 1 of the present experiment should not
yield inhibitory effects (mimicking the results of
Experiment 1 by Dijkstra et al., 1998), and part 2
should yield such inhibitory effects (mimicking Experiment 2 by Dijkstra et al., 1998). Such a result
would show that it is not the uncertainty of the
participants with respect to task requirements or
stimulus list composition that determined their performance in the earlier studies. It would also exclude
the possibility that participants had resorted to a mix
of processing strategies in Experiment 1 because they
did not know exactly what kind of stimuli to expect
(thus testing one possible motivation for De Groot et
al.'s mixed strategy view). Finally, if local stimulus
list composition affects the bilingual's performance
(e.g., by changing relative language activation or
decision criteria), then an immediate effect on homo-

graph recognition would be expected to occur as
soon as the transition from part 1 to 2 is made (cf. De
Groot et al., in press, n.5). Following the (R)rst presentation of a Dutch word, response times to homographs should slow down relative to matched
exclusively English control words.
Method
Participants
Fifty-six (22 male and 34 female; mean age 24.0
years) native speakers of Dutch participated in the
experiment. They had been studying English or Psychology at Nijmegen university for at least two years.
All participants had eight or more years of experience
with the English language (11.4 years on average),
and were paid for their participation.
Materials
Test and control words were identical to those used
in Dijkstra et al.'s (1998) Experiment 2. The homographic test words, selected from the English and
Dutch CELEX data-base (Baayen, Piepenbrock, &
van Rijn, 1993), had the same orthographic form in
the two languages but no semantic similarity across
languages (form-identical interlingual homographs).
All words were three to (R)ve letters long and had a
lemma frequency of at least one per million. Noun or
adjective was always their most frequent syntactic
category in English. When syntactically ambiguous,
frequency measures were based on summed frequencies across all syntactic categories involved. The
homographs were categorized according to their
orthogonal combination of word form frequencies
(high frequency, HF, or low frequency, LF) in
English (E) and Dutch (D). This resulted in 4 categories of homographs (HFE-HFD, HFE-LFD, LFEHFD, LFE-LFD) with 14 items in each category.
For each of the critical items, an English control item
was selected that matched the homograph in number
of letters, syntactic category (noun or adjective), and
frequency. A sample of the stimulus material is
presented in the appendix. Frequency data and mean
word length for the different categories of test and
control items are presented in Table 1 (for some
phonological characteristics of this stimulus set see
Dijkstra, Grainger, & Van Heuven, 1999).
Non-words that were orthographically legal in
English were constructed by changing one letter in
existing English words that had not been selected as
test or control items. These non-words had the same
length as the word stimuli. The non-words and the
control items were not homophonic to Dutch words.

Furthermore, two sets of exclusively English and
exclusively Dutch (R)ller words were selected that were
comparable to the test items in mean word length
(3.9 letters) and word frequency (mean log frequency
1.63). The total stimulus set consisted of 448 items
(56 homographs, 56 controls, 112 English (R)llers, 28
Dutch (R)llers, and 196 non-words).
Design
Unknown to the participants, the experiment was
divided into two parts. The stimuli were assigned to
the parts as follows. Both parts consisted of 28
blocks of eight stimuli including one homograph and
one control item. The order of items of the different
frequency categories was random across blocks,
except for the last homograph item in part 1 and the
(R)rst one in part 2, that were both members of the
LFE-HFD category. In part 1 the remaining six item
slots of each block were randomly (R)lled with English
(R)llers or non-words. Twenty-eight lists were constructed, of which 14 contained a homograph of a
particular frequency category in a given block, and
the other 14 contained their matched control items.
For example, if a homograph appeared at a certain
position in list 1, the matched control item was put at
that position in list 2. Furthermore, 14 lists had 7
homographs and 7 controls of each frequency category in part 1, while the other 14 lists had these
controls and homographs in part 2; for part 2, the
list's composition was just the opposite (e.g., controls
matched to homographs from part 1 were presented
in part 2, and homographs matched to controls from
part 1 were presented in part 2). To control for the
effects of language shift between consecutive items
(cf. Von Studnitz & Green, submitted), items that
preceded test and control items were carefully selected. English (R)llers (requiring yes'' responses) and

Interlingual homograph recognition
English-like non-words (requiring a no'' response)
were inserted in the stimulus list preceding homographs or control words (requiring yes'' responses)
in such a way that the obtained sequence of yes''
and no'' responses was unpredictable to the
participants.
The Dutch words did appear only in part 2. After
the (R)rst 224 experimental items, a Dutch word was
presented, followed by an English (R)ller or non-word
and then by a homograph or a control of the LFEHFD category. From that list position onwards,
Dutch words followed by a homograph or a control
item appeared once in every block of eight stimuli.
To keep the number of yes'' and no'' responses
equal, 28 extra non-words were included in part 1 to
match the 28 no'' responses to the Dutch words in
part 2.
Procedure
Participants were tested individually in a soundproof room. The experiment was run on an Apple
Macintosh Power PC 7200/95. The 15-inch monitor
was placed at a distance of approximately 65 cm
from the participants. Stimuli were presented in
black lowercase Courier (24 points) at the center of
the screen on a white background.
Participants received the standard instruction for
an English lexical decision task, except that they were
explicitly noti(R)ed (using examples) that (1) word
forms could occur that existed in both English and
Dutch (homographs) and that these words required a
yes'' response; and (2) words only belonging to
Dutch could also appear, requiring a no'' response.
The yes'' responses were always given with the
preferred hand. Instructions were written in English
and oral communication between participant and
experimenter was also conducted in English.
For presentation purposes, the stimulus set was
divided into three blocks. Short breaks were introduced between the blocks. There was no break
between parts 1 and 2. The blocks were preceded by
one block of 30 practice trials.2 At the beginning of
each block, the word ATTENTION'' was presented
at the center of the screen for 1000 ms. Each trial
started with the presentation of a (R)xation point at the
centre of the screen for 800 ms. Then the screen was
cleared, and 300 ms later a letter string appeared.
This string disappeared after the participant responded or after a time-out of 1500 ms. Inter-trial
2

To ensure that the task requirements were absolutely clear to the
participants, the practice set did not only contain examples of
interlingual homographs, but also two Dutch items, which
occurred early in the set. The majority of these items did indeed
induce a no'' response.

73

intervals were 700 ms. After the experiment, participants (R)lled in a questionnaire to assess their familiarity with the English language. Experimental
sessions lasted about 35 minutes.
Results
Data cleaning procedures were mainly based on error
rates for participants and items. We (R)rst removed the
data from nine participants whose test words had an
error rate larger than 30 per cent. Next, the data
from (R)ve items (three homograph test items and two
control items) with error rates larger than 50 per cent
were also excluded. Leaving out these items did not
affect the matching between test and control items.
For the remaining data points, response times
outside the range of two standard deviations from a
participant's and item's mean were considered outliers. Outliers and incorrect responses (7.6 per cent of
the data) were excluded from the analyses.
Means for test and control words in different
conditions are given in Table 2. Not included in this
table are the RTs to English (R)ller items, non-words,
and Dutch items. For part 1 the RTs to English (R)ller
items and non-words were 573 ms and 630 ms,
respectively. For part 2 the RTs to English (R)ller
items, non-words, and Dutch items were 592 ms, 629
ms, and 680 ms, respectively.
An analysis of variance with the factors Part (part
1/2), Word Status (homograph/control), and Frequency Category (HFE-HFD/HFE-LFD/LFE-HFD/
LFE-LFD) yielded main effects for Part
[F1(1,46)=17.98, p<.001; F2(1,99)=44.94, p<.001]
and Frequency Category [F1(3,44)=66.67, p<.001;
F2(3,99)=15.42, p<.001]. Mean RTs in part 1 (578
ms) were faster than in part 2 (602 ms). Word Status
did not result in a main effect [F1(1,46)=3.08, p=.09;
F2<1]. Mean latencies to test and control words were
591 ms and 586 ms, respectively. Critically, Part
interacted signi(R)cantly with Word Status [F1(1,46)=
8.24, p<.01; F2(1,99)=14.83, p<.001]. Mean RTs to
homographs were 575 ms in part 1 and 613 ms in
part 2, and those for their matched controls were 581
ms and 592 ms, respectively. The interaction is
graphically represented in Figure 1, together with the
corresponding data of Dijkstra et al. (1998). Frequency Category only marginally interacted with
Part [F1(3,44)=2.10, p=.11; F2(3,99)=2.90, p<.05]
and did not interact with Word Status [F1(3,44)=
1.20, p=.32; F2<1]. The interaction between Part,
Word Status, and Frequency Category did not reach
signi(R)cance [F1(3,44)<1; F2(3,99)=1.26, p=.29].
To obtain more information about the nature of
the interactions of Word Status and Frequency Category with Part, we performed separate analyses of

separate ANOVAs. An analysis with the factors Part
and Frequency Category on the latencies of the
homographs revealed a main effect of Part, reecting
the slowing down of responses from 575 ms in part 1
to 613 ms in part 2 [F1(1,46)=19.15, p<.001;
F2(1,49)=39.46, p<.001]. Frequency Category also
led to a signi(R)cant main effect [F1(3,44)=27.36,
p<.001; F2(3,49)=7.45, p<.001] and showed no interaction with Part [F1(3,44)=1.43, p=.25; F2(3,49)=
2.58, p=.06].
In contrast, the increase in response latencies to
control items from part 1 to part 2 was only marginally signi(R)cant (581 ms vs. 592 ms, respectively), as
indicated by a signi(R)cant main effect of Part by item
only [F1(1,46)=3.61, p=.06; F2(1,50)=6.75, p<.05].
Frequency Category remained signi(R)cant across
parts [F1(3,44)=71.70, p<.001; F2(3,50)=8.30,
p<.001] and there was no interaction with Part [both
Fs<1].
English and Dutch frequency for interlingual
homographs
For the homographs, the effects of the crossed
factors English frequency (high/low) and Dutch frequency (high/low) across parts were analyzed in
additional ANOVAs. In the overall analysis, Part
yielded a signi(R)cant main effect [F1(1,46)=19.15,
p<.001; F2(1,102)=47.62, p<.001], as did English
Frequency [F1(1,46)=71.86, p<.001; F2(1,102)=28.62,
p<.001]. Dutch Frequency resulted in a signi(R)cant
effect by participants only [F1(1,46)=7.59, p<.01;
F2(1,98)=1.30, p=.26]. While Part did not interact
signi(R)cantly with English Frequency [F1(1,46)<1;
F2(1,102)=2.40, p=.13], it did interact with Dutch
Frequency [F1(1,46)=4.04, p=.05; F2(1,102)=4.79,

triple interaction Part by English Frequency by
Dutch Frequency only yielded a marginal effect in
the participant analysis [F1(1,46)=3.48, p=.07;

Transition from Part 1 to Part 2
The experimental design also allowed us to examine
the transition from Part 1 to Part 2 at a more local
level (see Design section). Table 3 contains the mean
RTs and error rates for the last test items of Part 1
and the (R)rst of Part 2. RTs were slowed down
signi(R)cantly for the LFE-HFD homographs in part 2
relative to part 1 (82 ms, one-tailed t(33)=1.79,
p<.05), but not for the matched English control items
(24 ms, one-tailed t(30)=.60, p>.10). The error rates
for these items showed a similar pattern.
Discussion
In the present lexical decision experiment, participants knew they would have to respond no'' to
words having only a Dutch reading, but such items

75

were presented only in the second part of the experiment. No signi(R)cant RT differences were found
between the interlingual homographs and matched
English control items in the (R)rst part of the experiment.3 However, strong inhibitory effects for interlingual homographs relative to control words were
observed in the second part. Examination of the
transition from part 1 to part 2 showed that, as soon
as Dutch items started to come in, the RTs to
interlingual homographs were considerably slowed
down compared to control words.
The absence of an inhibition effect for interlingual
homographs in part 1 of the experiment parallels the
results obtained by Dijkstra et al. (1998, Experiment
1) and by De Groot et al. (in press, Experiment 2a).
However, in contrast to those earlier experiments, the
instruction of the present experiment clearly indicated that Dutch words requiring a no'' response
might appear. Nevertheless, no inhibition for interlingual homographs was obtained in part 1, showing
that the participants' performance was not affected
by whether the instruction did or did not mention the
possibility that Dutch words would be presented.
These results have clear consequences for the
theoretical views described in the introduction. First
of all, they clarify the relative importance of a
number of factors that have been proposed by Grosjean (1998, in press) as potentially relevant for the
participants' language mode and hence for their
performance in this experiment. In our experiment,
explicitness of instruction did not affect the observed
pattern of results. At (R)rst sight, that would seem to
be incompatible with Grosjean's (1998, in press) view
as exposed in the Introduction. However, in line with
Grosjean (1998, in press) one could assume that the
participants in our experiment were already in an
intermediary bilingual mode when they entered the
experimentation room, because, as in Experiment 1
by Dijkstra et al. (1998), they knew that the experiment was going to be bilingual in nature. It then
follows from the similar results in the two studies
that making explicit in our instruction how both
languages would be relevant for responding, did not
move the participants' language mode any further
towards the bilingual end of the continuum. In contrast, the appearance of the (R)rst item belonging
exclusively to the other language (Dutch) in part 2
did immediately affect the participants' behavior,
inducing inhibition effects like in Experiment 2 by
Dijkstra et al. (1998). Thus, within this type of
3

These null-effects in Part 1 arose despite the presence of two
Dutch items early in the preceding practice set (see n.2). Apparently, the effects of these Dutch items had decayed by the time
the real'' experiment began or had become too small to be
detected.

Ton Dijkstra, Ellen de Bruijn, Herbert Schriefers and Sjoerd ten Brinke

account, our experimental results can be interpreted
as evidence that the participants' implicit general
expectations (i.e. that two languages will be relevant)
and language intermixing are more important determinants of the language mode than speci(R)c expectancies introduced by the explicit instruction.
Alternatively, it could be assumed that the participant's expectancies, whether induced by the speci(R)c
instruction or not, did not affect the bilingual word
recognition process at all, at least not after the
participant had generated a task schema (Green,
1998) for the task at hand. This view would be much
more in line with Dijkstra et al.'s (1998) account.
According to this view, the presence of inhibitory
effects in Part 2 of the experiment only was a
consequence of a more strongly activated Dutch
lexicon due to the presence of exclusively Dutch
items.4
However, recent evidence by Dijkstra et al. (1999)
suggests it may not even be necessary to assume a
difference in the activation of the Dutch lexicon in
Part 1 and Part 2 of our experiment to account for
the overall data pattern. In an experimental situation
with a stimulus list composition directly comparable
to that of Part 1 of our experiment, these authors
observed facilitatory effects of orthographic identity
between Dutch and English readings of interlingual
homographs, but inhibitory effects of cross-linguistic
phonological similarity. Interlingual homographs
that were similar across languages only in terms of
their orthography (e.g., STAGE, pronounced differently in Dutch and English) were recognized faster
than matched control items, but no RT differences
were found for homographs that were similar both in
terms of orthography and phonology (e.g., STEP). In
line with these (R)ndings, Dijkstra et al. proposed that
the null-result for homographs in Dijkstra et al.'s
(1998) Experiment 1 originated from opposite effects
of cross-linguistic orthographic and phonological
overlap between the two readings of the interlingual
homographs.
Applying this recent explanation to the null-effects
in Part 1 of our study, the presence of homograph
effects in Part 2 of our study and their absence in
Part 1 can then be considered as the consequence of a
context-sensitive adaptation of the participants' decision behavior to the local stimulus list composition,
rather than as a difference in the relative activation of
the Dutch lexicon in the two parts. Lexical candidates

The relatively large Standard Errors and error rates for the
interlingual homographs relative to the controls (see Table 2) can
be seen as additional evidence of increased competition between
the two readings of the homographs in Part 2. Convergent
distributional analyses of homograph and control latencies are
presented in Dijkstra, Timmermans, & Schriefers (in press).

from both lexicons would always be completely
activated on the basis of word input. Adaptation of
decision criteria would be a consequence of the
introduction of Dutch items and it would affect
especially the latencies of the homographs because
they have a Dutch reading as well.
However, a reconciliation of the two positions is
also possible, by assuming that the amount of activation required to identify a particular item (its recognition threshold) is strategy and context-sensitive. In
Part 2, more activation of an English item would be
required for identi(R)cation in order to avoid mistakenly identifying a Dutch word as a target item. This
approach could easily be implemented as a variant of
the BIA model (Dijkstra & Van Heuven, 1998).
Strategic aspects of processing also played a role
in the third position described in the Introduction.
De Groot et al. (in press) would explain the nullresults in the (R)rst part of the experiment as a
cancellation of facilitation and inhibition effects associated with language neutral'' and language speci(R)c'' processing modes. The present results indicate
that, irrespective of the processing mode that the
participants adopted either consciously or unconsciously, this mode did not arise because they were
uncertain about the task demands. Furthermore, the
results go against a different hypothesis proposed by
De Groot et al., namely that the stimulus set (list
composition) did not play the important role that
Dijkstra et al. (1998) assigned to it. Our participants
clearly changed to a different processing mode as
soon as the (R)rst Dutch test item had been presented.
Thus, one has to conclude that it is the change in
stimulus list composition (degree of language intermixing) between Part 1 and Part 2 that led to the
change in performance by the participants.
This conclusion (R)nds further support in the
(R)nding that Dutch frequency played a statistically
signi(R)cant role only in the second part of the experiment, which also shows that the introduction of
Dutch items in the second part indeed underlies the
change in performance by the participants. The theoretical views by De Groot et al. (in press), Dijkstra et
al. (1998), and Grosjean (in press) all have their own
mechanism to account for this result. For instance, in
line with De Groot et al. (in press) the Dutch items
may somehow have forced the participants into a
more language speci(R)c processing mode. Participants
may have become more strict in paying attention to
the language label of each encountered word. Alternatively, in line with Dijkstra et al. (1998) and
Grosjean (in press), the presence of Dutch items in
Part 2 of the experiment may have activated the
Dutch lexicon to a larger extent than in Part 1.
Whichever interpretation is favored, it should also

Interlingual homograph recognition
take into account our (R)nding that the transition from
Part 1 to Part 2 was rather abrupt in its effect on RTs
to interlingual homographs. Immediately after the
(R)rst Dutch item came in, RTs to interlingual homographs but not to the controls became considerably
slower (see Table 3). Indeed, response times to controls were affected only marginally in our experiment
by the presence or absence of Dutch items (also
compare the control conditions in the three experiments by Dijkstra et al., 1998). Furthermore, a
comparison of Table 2 (results for Part 1 and Part 2
as a whole) and Table 3 (results for the last trials of
Part 1 and the (R)rst trials of Part 2) suggests that the
homograph inhibition effect reached its maximal
value immediately after presentation of the (R)rst
Dutch item (LFE-HFD homograph items became 67
ms slower over-all, and 82 ms at the transition from
part 1 to part 2). Future research should test this
hypothesis that the presentation of just one Dutch
word already had a maximal inhibitory effect on the
participants' responses to interlingual homographs
and that there was no further increase of inhibition
after multiple presentations of Dutch items.
Related issues to be explored are how long-lasting
(i.e. for how many subsequent trials) the effects of a
presented non-target language item on homograph
processing are and whether they can be strategically
modulated by the participants. A recent study by
Von Studnitz & Green (submitted) suggests that the
observed increased interference for homograph after
the introduction of other-language items can indeed
be strategically reduced over time.
To conclude, for language-speci(R)c lexical decision
we have shown that explicitly informing participants
about the presence of non-target language items in
the stimulus list did not change their performance
relative to a situation with implicit instruction (Dijkstra et al., 1998, Experiment 1). In contrast, encountering non-target language items in the stimulus list
had immediate and severe effects on the participants'
performance. These results are in line with language
non-selective access models of bilingual word recognition that attribute a strong role to bottom-up
factors, like the BIA model (Dijkstra & Van Heuven,
1998; Dijkstra et al. 1998; Van Heuven, Dijkstra, &
Grainger, 1998). In addition, the results indicate that
participants try to optimize their performance in a
particular experimental situation on the basis of
their recent experience with list items, adapting their
bilingual word recognition process depending on the
characteristics (e.g., language membership) of the
encountered items. Interpreted in this way, the
present (R)ndings are directly compatible with the
common view on monolingual word recognition,
namely that word recognition is an automatic

77

process in which multiple lexical candidates are
activated in parallel, a process that can be affected
by shifts in parameter settings on the basis of recent
experience (Lima & Huntsman, 1997; Grainger &
Jacobs, 1996).
